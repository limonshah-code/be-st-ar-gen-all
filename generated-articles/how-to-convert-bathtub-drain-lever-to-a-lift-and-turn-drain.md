Converting your bathtub drain lever to a lift and turn drain involves removing the old overflow plate and linkage, then installing a new lift-and-turn stopper that connects directly to the drain opening. This upgrade simplifies operation and often improves drainage, giving your bathtub a more modern and reliable stopper system.

## Why Convert Your Bathtub Drain Lever System?

Many homeowners still use older bathtub drain lever systems. These designs often have internal linkages. These linkages connect the overflow plate to the drain stopper. Over time, these parts can corrode. They might also break or become stiff. This makes it hard to open or close the drain.

A broken lever drain means your tub cannot hold water. It also means you cannot drain water easily. This causes frustration during baths or showers. A faulty drain also becomes a hygiene problem. Standing water can collect debris. It can also encourage mold growth.

Replacing an old lever system with a lift-and-turn drain offers clear benefits. Lift-and-turn drains operate with a simple twist. They are easy to use for all ages. They also have fewer internal parts. This means less chance of breaking down. Such a change can prevent future plumbing headaches. It also gives your bathroom a more updated look.

Converting to a lift-and-turn drain is a practical choice. It improves your bathroom's function. It also adds to its modern appeal. This project enhances your daily bathing experience. It also reduces future maintenance needs. A smooth-working drain is key for a comfortable bathroom.

## Understanding Bathtub Drain Types: Lever vs. Lift-and-Turn

Before starting your conversion project, it helps to know your drain type. Bathtub drains come in several styles. Each style has a different way of stopping water. Understanding these differences makes the conversion process clearer.

### Old Lever Drain Systems

Lever drains, also called trip lever or plunger drains, have an external lever. This lever is usually on the overflow plate. When you move the lever, it activates a rod or plunger inside the drain pipe. This rod goes down to block the drain opening. Some older models use a "pop-up" style stopper. This stopper is connected by a rod to the overflow plate. It moves up and down to stop water.

The main issue with lever systems is their internal parts. The rod can collect hair and soap scum. This causes clogs. The linkage can also bend or break. This makes the stopper useless. Replacing parts can be difficult. It often requires access behind the tub.

### Modern Lift-and-Turn Drains

Lift-and-turn drains are much simpler. They do not have complex internal linkages. The stopper itself sits directly in the drain opening. You lift the stopper slightly and turn it to close the drain. You turn it back and push it down to open it.

This design has fewer moving parts. This makes it more reliable. It is also easier to clean hair and debris. You can often remove the stopper quickly for cleaning. This reduces clogs. Lift-and-turn drains also give a cleaner look. They do not have a visible lever sticking out. This makes them a popular choice for bathroom remodels.

Knowing these differences helps you prepare. You are removing a system with hidden parts. You are installing a self-contained unit. This understanding sets the stage for a smooth conversion. It also highlights the advantages of your new drain.

## Essential Tools and Materials for Drain Conversion

Starting any DIY project needs proper preparation. Having the right tools and materials makes the job easier. It also helps you finish without delays. For converting your bathtub drain, gather everything before you begin. This prevents mid-project trips to the store.

### Tools You Will Need:

*   **Screwdriver Set (Phillips and Flathead):** Essential for removing overflow plate screws. You will also use them for stopper adjustments.
*   **Pliers (Adjustable or Channel-Lock):** Good for gripping and turning old drain parts. They provide the necessary leverage.
*   **Drain Wrench or Drain Removal Tool:** This tool fits into the crosshairs of the drain opening. It helps unscrew the old drain flange. This is often a crucial tool.
*   **Putty Knife or Scraper:** Useful for removing old plumber's putty. It also helps with old caulk.
*   **Rag or Old Cloths:** For wiping up water and debris. Keep plenty on hand.
*   **Bucket:** To catch any water that drains during removal.
*   **Flashlight or Headlamp:** For better visibility inside the drain pipe. This helps you see old parts.
*   **Utility Knife:** For cutting away old caulk around the drain.
*   **Cleaning Supplies:** For cleaning the area after old drain removal. This includes a brush and cleaner. You might also need something to [clean bathtub drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bathtub-drain) before the new installation.

### Materials You Will Need:

*   **New Lift-and-Turn Bathtub Drain Assembly:** This includes the new drain flange, stopper, and overflow plate. Make sure the finish matches your existing fixtures. Check the pipe size, usually 1Â½ inches.
*   **Plumber's Putty:** This soft, pliable compound creates a watertight seal. You apply it under the new drain flange.
*   **Silicone Sealant (Kitchen & Bath Grade):** Provides an extra layer of waterproofing around the overflow plate. Choose a mildew-resistant type.
*   **Teflon Tape (Plumber's Tape):** Used on threaded pipe connections for an extra seal.
*   **Gloves:** Protect your hands from grime and sharp edges.
*   **Safety Glasses:** Protect your eyes from debris.

Having these items ready saves time. It also reduces frustration. You can focus on the steps ahead. This preparation is a small effort for a smooth project.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Removing Your Old Lever Drain

Removing the old lever-style drain is the first major step. This process requires patience. You must work carefully to avoid damaging your tub. Here, I break down how to get rid of that old system.

### 1. Prepare the Area

First, make sure the tub is completely dry. Clear any items from around the drain. Place an old towel or rag in the tub. This protects the tub surface from scratches. Keep your bucket nearby to catch any water.

### 2. Remove the Overflow Plate

Locate the overflow plate. This is on the side of your tub, above the drain. It usually has one or two screws. Use your screwdriver to remove these screws. Gently pull the overflow plate away from the tub. Be careful, as a rod or linkage might be attached. This rod connects the plate to the drain stopper. Pull the rod and stopper assembly out from the overflow pipe. Sometimes, the stopper might be stuck in the drain. If so, pull the rod up as far as you can. Then, you might need to unscrew the drain shoe from below the tub. This is rare for the lever stopper, but possible.

### 3. Remove the Old Drain Stopper (If Separate)

If your stopper came out with the rod, great. If not, it might be a pop-up type connected to the overflow. In some cases, you will need to unscrew the stopper from inside the drain. Some stoppers simply pull out. Others twist off. Inspect your specific old drain for its removal method.

### 4. Remove the Drain Flange

This is often the trickiest part. The drain flange is the metal ring visible in the tub's bottom. It screws into the drain shoe beneath the tub. Look closely at the drain opening. You will see crosshairs inside. Insert your drain wrench into these crosshairs. Turn the wrench counter-clockwise to loosen the flange. If it's very tight, you might need more force. Old plumber's putty can make it stick.

If the drain wrench slips, try other methods. Some people use a sturdy pair of pliers. Grip the crosshairs firmly and turn. Be careful not to damage the tub finish. Once the flange starts to turn, continue unscrewing it. It might require several full rotations.

### 5. Clean the Drain Opening

After removing the old flange, you will see old plumber's putty or caulk. Use your putty knife or scraper to remove all of it. Clean the tub surface around the drain hole thoroughly. You want a clean, smooth surface for the new seal. This step is critical for preventing leaks. You can use a damp rag or a mild cleaning solution. Ensure all grime and debris are gone. This is a good time to [clean a clogged drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-clogged-drain) if you noticed slow drainage before.

You have now successfully removed the old drain. The tub is ready for its new lift-and-turn system. Take a moment to appreciate your progress.

## Installing Your New Lift-and-Turn Bathtub Drain

With the old drain gone, installing the new lift-and-turn system is next. This process focuses on creating a tight, leak-proof seal. Take your time with each step. Proper installation ensures a reliable drain for years.

### 1. Prepare the New Drain Flange

Take your new lift-and-turn drain flange. Roll a thin rope of plumber's putty. This rope should be about Â¼ inch thick. Place this putty rope around the underside of the drain flange's rim. Make sure it creates a complete circle. This putty forms the primary seal between the flange and the tub. You can also apply a thin bead of silicone sealant instead. Some professionals prefer silicone for its long-lasting seal. I personally find plumber's putty easier to work with for first-timers.

### 2. Install the New Drain Flange

Carefully lower the new drain flange into the tub's drain opening. Press it down firmly. This presses the plumber's putty to form a seal. From beneath the tub (if accessible), you will attach the drain shoe. The drain shoe is the part of the drain pipe that connects to the flange. Most new drain kits come with a new drain shoe or a way to connect to your existing one. Apply a thin layer of Teflon tape to the threads of the drain shoe if itâs a threaded connection. Then, screw the drain shoe connector up into the drain flange.

Tighten the drain flange using your drain wrench. Turn it clockwise until it is snug. Do not overtighten it. Overtightening can crack the tub or strip the threads. The plumber's putty should squeeze out evenly around the flange. This shows a good seal. Wipe away this excess putty immediately. A damp cloth works well.

### 3. Install the Overflow Plate

Next, install the new overflow plate. This plate usually does not have a rod or linkage. It simply covers the overflow opening. Apply a thin bead of silicone sealant around the back edge of the overflow plate. Position it over the overflow hole. Insert the screw(s) and tighten them. Do not overtighten. The silicone creates a watertight seal against the tub.

### 4. Install the Lift-and-Turn Stopper

Your new lift-and-turn stopper simply drops into the drain flange. It has a threaded post on the bottom. Screw this post into the center of the drain flange. Turn it clockwise until it is snug. Test the stopper's function. Lift it slightly and turn to close the drain. Turn it back and push down to open. It should move smoothly.

### 5. Test for Leaks

This is a critical final step. Close the new drain stopper. Fill the bathtub with water. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes. Check underneath the tub for any leaks. Look closely around the drain shoe connection and overflow pipe. If you see drips, tighten connections carefully. You might need to reseal the drain flange with more putty or silicone if leaks persist from the top. If there are no leaks, you have successfully completed the installation.

Now you have a fully functional, modern lift-and-turn drain. Enjoy the ease of use and improved look.

## Troubleshooting Common Bathtub Drain Conversion Challenges

Even with careful planning, sometimes issues arise during a DIY project. Converting a bathtub drain can present a few common challenges. Knowing how to address them helps you finish the job smoothly. I will outline some problems and their solutions.

### 1. Leaks After Installation

This is the most common and frustrating issue. Leaks usually happen around the drain flange or the overflow plate.

*   **Issue:** Leak around the drain flange.
    *   **Solution:** The plumber's putty seal is likely insufficient. Drain the tub. Unscrew the drain flange. Remove all old putty. Apply a fresh, thicker bead of plumber's putty or silicone sealant under the flange. Reinstall and tighten properly. Ensure the surface was clean before applying the seal.
*   **Issue:** Leak around the overflow plate.
    *   **Solution:** The silicone seal around the overflow plate is not tight enough. Remove the overflow plate. Clean off old silicone. Apply a new, consistent bead of silicone sealant. Reinstall and tighten the screws. Give the silicone time to cure before testing with water.

### 2. Difficulty Removing the Old Drain Flange

Old drains can be very stubborn. Corrosion often binds them tightly.

*   **Issue:** Drain wrench slips or cannot turn the flange.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **Apply penetrating oil:** Spray a rust-penetrating oil (like WD-40) onto the threads. Let it sit for an hour. This can help loosen old rust.
        *   **Use a larger wrench/pliers:** Sometimes, more leverage is needed. Channel-lock pliers can grip the flange's crosshairs. Be careful not to damage the tub.
        *   **Heat (caution!):** A heat gun can warm the flange. This expands the metal and breaks the seal. Use extreme caution. Do not overheat the tub itself.
        *   **Cut it out:** As a last resort, you can carefully cut the flange using a specialized tool. This is a more advanced technique.

### 3. Stopper Not Sealing or Operating Smoothly

Your new lift-and-turn stopper should close completely and open easily.

*   **Issue:** Stopper does not hold water or closes partially.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **Adjust the threaded post:** The lift-and-turn stopper has a threaded post on its underside. You can often adjust its length. Unscrew it a bit to make it longer. This allows it to seat more deeply into the drain.
        *   **Check for debris:** Small debris or excess plumber's putty might prevent a full seal. Remove the stopper and inspect the drain opening. [Clean hair from shower drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hair-from-shower-drain) or other debris if present.
*   **Issue:** Stopper is stiff or hard to turn.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **Lubrication:** A tiny amount of plumber's grease around the moving parts of the stopper can help.
        *   **Loosen slightly:** You might have overtightened the stopper's threaded post. Loosen it a quarter turn. It should still be snug, but allow for movement.

Dealing with these issues calmly saves time. Most problems have straightforward solutions. You can complete your conversion successfully.

## Maintaining Your New Lift-and-Turn Drain for Longevity

You have successfully installed your new lift-and-turn drain. Now, keeping it in good working order is key. Proper maintenance ensures it lasts for many years. It also prevents future clogs and operational problems. I will share simple steps to keep your drain clean and functional.

### 1. Regular Cleaning of the Stopper

Lift-and-turn drains are easy to clean. Hair, soap scum, and other debris can build up. This slows drainage and can affect the stopper's seal.

*   **Daily Wipe-Down:** After each use, wipe down the visible parts of the stopper. This removes fresh soap scum.
*   **Weekly Stopper Removal:** Once a week, unscrew the lift-and-turn stopper. It typically unscrews easily from the drain opening.
*   **Clean Underneath:** Remove any hair or debris wrapped around the stopper's post. Use an old brush or paper towel.
*   **Drain Opening Clean:** Clean the inside of the drain opening where the stopper sits. This prevents buildup. You can use a mild bathroom cleaner.

This routine prevents most clogs. It keeps your drain operating smoothly. It also avoids bigger cleaning jobs later.

### 2. Addressing Slow Drains

Even with regular cleaning, sometimes drains slow down. This happens if debris gets past the stopper.

*   **Hot Water Flush:** Pour a kettle of hot water down the drain. This can dissolve soap scum and grease.
*   **Baking Soda and Vinegar:** This natural method helps clear minor clogs. Pour half a cup of baking soda down the drain. Follow with half a cup of white vinegar. Let it sit for 30 minutes. Then, flush with hot water. This is a great way to [clean sink drain with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-sink-drain-with-vinegar).
*   **Drain Snake/Hair Clog Tool:** For tougher clogs, a small plastic drain snake or hair clog tool works well. Insert it into the drain. Twist and pull out any hair or debris. This method is effective for [cleaning hair from shower drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hair-from-shower-drain) specifically.
*   **Avoid Chemical Drain Cleaners:** These products can damage pipes over time. They are often harsh. Use them only as a last resort.

### 3. Checking for Loose Connections

Over time, components can loosen. This is rare for a lift-and-turn system.

*   **Periodically Tighten:** Every few months, check the drain flange. Use your drain wrench to ensure it is still snug. This prevents small leaks from forming.
*   **Inspect Silicone/Putty:** Look at the seals around the drain flange and overflow plate. If you see cracks or gaps, reapply sealant.

Following these maintenance tips keeps your new lift-and-turn drain in top condition. You will enjoy its reliable function for many years. A little care goes a long way.
