### Common Follett Ice Machine Problems and Quick Fixes

You arrive at work, and the Follett ice machine is not making ice. This situation creates a major headache. Many problems have simple solutions. You can often diagnose and fix basic issues quickly. Always start by checking the power supply.

First, confirm the machine receives power. Is the power cord plugged in firmly? Check the circuit breaker. A tripped breaker stops all power to the unit. Reset the breaker if it is tripped. Next, locate the machine's master switch. This switch controls the unit's main power. Ensure it is in the "On" or "Ice" position. Sometimes, it gets bumped to "Off" or "Standby."

Verify the water supply. Follett ice machines need a continuous water flow. Is the water shut-off valve open? Check for kinks in the water line. Low water pressure can also cause problems. Ensure your building's water pressure is adequate. Sometimes, a clogged water filter restricts flow. A dirty filter prevents enough water from reaching the ice-making components. Replace the water filter if it looks old or if water flow is poor. Always use the correct filter for your Follett model. If you are having general issues with various ice makers, you might find similar troubleshooting steps useful for other brands as well, such as [Ice-O-Matic ice machine troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/ice-o-matic-ice-machine-troubleshooting). These basic checks are often the first steps regardless of the brand.

Finally, check the ice bin itself. If the bin is full, the machine stops making ice. This is a normal function to prevent overflow. Empty the bin if it is full. Ensure the ice level sensor is not blocked by ice or debris. A blocked sensor thinks the bin is full, even when it is not. Clearing obstructions can restart ice production immediately. These initial steps resolve many common Follett ice machine issues.

### Understanding Follett Ice Machine Error Codes

Follett ice machines use error codes to tell you what is wrong. These codes appear on the display panel. They help you quickly diagnose specific issues. Knowing what each code means speeds up the repair process. Always check your specific Follett model's manual for a complete list of codes. The manual provides detailed instructions for each one.

Common error codes often relate to water flow, temperature, or sensor malfunctions. For example, a code might indicate low water pressure. This directs you to check the water supply line and filter. Another code could point to an evaporator coil temperature issue. This suggests problems with the refrigeration system or its sensors. Sometimes, error codes signal a dirty sensor. Cleaning the sensor can clear the code and restore normal operation. Remember, specific models have unique codes. A code on a Follett 7 Series machine might differ from a Maestro series.

When an error code appears, write it down. Then, consult your Follett user manual. The manual explains the code's meaning and provides troubleshooting steps. Often, you need to power cycle the machine. Turn it off, wait a few minutes, then turn it back on. This sometimes resets the system and clears transient errors. If the code persists, the manual guides you to the specific component needing attention. Understanding these codes saves time and prevents unnecessary service calls. For instance, if you encounter problems with other appliance ice makers, such as a [GE refrigerator ice maker troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/ge-refrigerator-ice-maker-troubleshooting) guide, you will see that error codes are a universal diagnostic tool.

If the error code points to a major component failure, like the compressor, you may need professional help. Do not attempt repairs beyond your skill level. Some components handle high voltage or refrigerants. These require specialized tools and training. Refer to your manual or a qualified technician for complex error code resolutions.

### Addressing Water Supply and Drainage Issues in Follett Machines

Water is essential for ice production. Problems with water supply or drainage will stop your Follett ice machine cold. Ensuring proper water flow in and out of the unit is crucial. Issues in these areas are frequent causes of machine malfunction.

First, examine the water inlet. A clogged water filter is a common culprit. Over time, sediment and minerals build up in the filter. This restricts water flow to the ice maker. Check your manual for the recommended filter replacement schedule. Replacing the filter regularly prevents many water flow problems. If you have low water pressure in your building, this also affects ice production. The machine may not fill correctly or at all. You can install a booster pump if low pressure is a consistent issue. Ensure the water supply valve to the machine is fully open. Sometimes, it gets partially closed, limiting flow.

Next, consider drainage. Follett ice machines produce meltwater during the defrost cycle. This water must drain away properly. Look at the drain line. It can become clogged with scale, slime, or debris. A clogged drain line causes water to back up into the machine. This can lead to overflows or sensors detecting too much water. Clear any blockages you find. You can use a stiff brush or a plumbing snake for stubborn clogs. Ensure the drain line has a proper downward slope. If it sags or has an uphill section, water will sit in the line. This prevents proper drainage. Also, check that the drain line is not submerged in standing water at its discharge point. This can create a vacuum, preventing drainage.

Proper water quality is also important. Hard water contains minerals that build up as scale. Scale can clog lines, spray nozzles, and interfere with sensors. Regular cleaning helps prevent scale buildup. Using a water softener or specific water treatment system can reduce mineral content. If you're looking for general advice on maintaining your ice maker's water system, resources like [how to clean an ice maker](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-ice-maker) can provide helpful tips on preventing mineral buildup and ensuring proper water flow, regardless of brand. Addressing these water-related issues keeps your Follett machine running efficiently.

### Solving Ice Production Problems with Follett Ice Makers

When your Follett ice maker is not producing ice or producing too little, several factors could be at play. Identifying the specific cause helps you fix the issue. This section focuses on common reasons for poor ice production and how to resolve them.

One frequent issue is an evaporator coil that is not cold enough. This can happen if the ambient temperature around the machine is too high. Follett ice machines need good ventilation. Ensure the air vents are clear and not blocked by walls or other equipment. The machine needs to expel hot air efficiently. Poor ventilation causes the compressor to overheat. This leads to reduced cooling performance. Check the condenser coils. These coils remove heat from the refrigerant. If they are dirty, dust and debris prevent proper heat exchange. Clean the condenser coils regularly with a brush or vacuum cleaner. This simple step often restores cooling efficiency.

Another cause of low ice production is low refrigerant. Refrigerant is the fluid that cools the evaporator coil. If the system has a leak, the refrigerant level drops. This reduces cooling capacity. Detecting a refrigerant leak usually requires professional tools. You will likely need a certified technician for this repair. Do not attempt to add refrigerant yourself. This requires specific training and equipment. Similar to other brands, like [U-Line ice maker troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/u-line-ice-maker-troubleshooting), compressor issues or refrigerant leaks often require professional intervention.

Sometimes, the ice thickness sensor needs adjustment. This sensor tells the machine when the ice slab is ready to drop. If it is miscalibrated, the machine might harvest too early or too late. This results in thin ice or no ice drop at all. Consult your Follett manual for instructions on adjusting the ice thickness sensor. This is often a small adjustment screw or a digital setting. If the ice mold itself is scaled up, ice may stick and not release. Regular cleaning prevents this problem. Ensure the ice harvest cycle is completing properly. Problems with the harvest assist solenoid or hot gas valve can also prevent ice from dropping. Addressing these components helps restore full ice production from your Follett ice maker.

### Maintenance and Cleaning for Optimal Follett Performance

Regular maintenance and cleaning are vital for any Follett ice machine. Proper care prevents most common issues. It also extends the life of your machine. Neglecting cleaning leads to scale buildup, slime, and reduced efficiency.
