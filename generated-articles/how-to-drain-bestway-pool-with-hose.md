## Easy Steps to Drain Your Bestway Pool with a Hose

Have you ever looked at your Bestway pool and wondered how to get all that water out? Draining a pool can seem like a big job. But with the right approach, it becomes a simple task. Many Bestway pool owners find a standard garden hose is all they need.

This article shows you how to drain your Bestway pool with a hose. We will cover everything from preparing your pool to ensuring proper water disposal. You will learn about necessary tools and helpful tips. We aim to make your pool draining experience easy and effective. Getting rid of pool water does not need to be a chore.

### Takeaway:

*   **Prepare Your Pool:** Balance water chemistry and remove debris before draining.
*   **Gather Tools:** You need a garden hose, hose adapter, and possibly a submersible pump.
*   **Choose Drain Spot:** Direct water to a safe, permissible area away from foundations.
*   **Start Siphoning:** Use the siphoning method with your hose for gravity draining.
*   **Monitor Progress:** Stay present during the draining process for safety and efficiency.
*   **Clean and Store:** After draining, clean the pool and store it properly.

Draining your Bestway pool with a hose is a simple process. You use gravity to siphon water out. Attach a garden hose to the pool's drain valve, extend it to a lower, safe drainage area, and open the valve. This method effectively empties the pool using basic tools.

## Why You Must Drain Your Bestway Pool

Pool maintenance involves more than just skimming leaves. Eventually, you need to empty your pool. Draining your Bestway pool is important for several reasons. It helps keep your pool in good shape.

One main reason to drain your pool is for seasonal closing. When winter approaches, you must prepare your pool for cold weather. Emptying it prevents water from freezing and damaging the pool liner or frame. This step protects your investment.

Another reason to drain is for deep cleaning. Over time, algae or dirt can build up. Draining allows you to scrub the pool bottom and walls thoroughly. This gives you a fresh start for the next swimming season. Regularly cleaning the bottom of the pool ensures a clean swimming environment.

Sometimes, your water chemistry can become unbalanced. High levels of chemicals or persistent algae problems may require a complete water change. Draining and refilling helps reset the water quality. This ensures safe and enjoyable swimming. Proper pool care means knowing when to change the water.

Moving your pool also requires draining it. If you plan to relocate your Bestway pool, you must empty it first. A full pool is too heavy to move. Draining makes the pool light enough to handle. This also applies if you need to repair the pool liner.

Finally, draining prevents standing water issues. Stagnant water can attract insects like mosquitoes. It can also become a breeding ground for bacteria. Emptying your pool removes this potential health hazard. It keeps your backyard safe and clean. You may also need to drain water from your pool after heavy rain if the water level becomes too high.

## Gathering Your Essential Draining Tools

Draining your Bestway pool with a hose is easy. But you need the right tools to do it correctly. Having everything ready saves time and effort. I always make sure I have my supplies organized before starting.

The most important tool is a garden hose. You likely already own one. Make sure your hose is long enough to reach your desired drainage spot. A longer hose prevents water from pooling too close to your house or yard. I recommend checking for kinks or damage before use.

Next, you will need the Bestway pool drain adapter. Most Bestway pools come with this piece. It usually screws onto the pool's drain valve. This adapter allows you to connect a standard garden hose directly to the pool. If you lost yours, you can often find replacements online or at pool supply stores. Without this adapter, connecting the hose securely is difficult.

You might also want a hose clamp. This is not always necessary for the siphoning method. But it can help secure the hose to the adapter, preventing leaks. A simple clamp can add an extra layer of security. This is especially true if your hose connection feels loose.

Consider having a submersible pump if you want to drain the pool faster. While the title focuses on using a hose for gravity draining, a pump can speed up the process. Some pumps have attachments for garden hoses. This gives you more options for water disposal. A pump is good for very large pools or when time is limited.

Safety gloves are also a good idea. You might handle chemicals or simply want to protect your hands. They provide a better grip too. A bucket or small container can be useful for catching any initial drips. This helps keep your work area tidy.

Finally, have a way to shut off the water supply to your house, just in case. While not directly for draining, it is a good safety measure. Having these tools ready makes the draining process smooth. It helps you drain your Bestway pool with a hose efficiently.

## Preparing Your Bestway Pool for Draining

Before you drain your Bestway pool, some preparation is necessary. This step ensures a smooth process. It also helps protect your pool and surrounding environment. Proper preparation makes the job easier for everyone.

First, test your pool's water chemistry. You do not want to release highly chlorinated or chemical-laden water into your yard or storm drain. High chemical levels can harm plants, grass, and aquatic life. If your chlorine levels are high, let the pool sit for a few days. Sunlight helps dissipate the chlorine. You can also add a neutralizer to speed up the process. This ensures the water is safe for disposal.

Next, remove any large debris from the pool. Use a skimmer net to clear leaves, insects, and other floating items. This prevents clogs in your hose or drain valve. I always spend a few minutes on this step. It makes the draining much smoother. You want to make sure the bottom of the pool is clean before you drain. [Explore ways to clean pool walls](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pool-walls) and the bottom before draining.

Clean the pool walls and bottom as much as possible. Even though you are draining, a quick brush can loosen dirt. This dirt will then flow out with the water. This makes the post-drainage cleaning easier. It prevents stubborn stains from setting in. A clean pool before draining means less work later.

Lower the water level slightly if needed. If your pool has a skimmer, you might want to drain a bit of water first. This ensures you can access the drain valve easily. Some Bestway pools have drain valves near the bottom. This makes access simple.

Ensure your pool area is clear. Move any toys, furniture, or other items that might get in the way. You need a clear path for the hose. This also prevents tripping hazards. A clear area makes the job safer.

Check the pool's drain valve itself. Make sure it is clean and free of obstructions. Sometimes small debris can get stuck there. A quick wipe can prevent issues when you connect the hose. Preparing your pool carefully makes draining it simple and problem-free. It protects your property and the environment.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Draining Your Bestway Pool with a Garden Hose

Draining your Bestway pool using a garden hose relies on a simple principle: siphoning. This method uses gravity to pull water out. It is efficient and requires minimal equipment. Follow these steps for success.

### Connecting the Hose

First, locate the drain valve on your Bestway pool. It is usually near the bottom on one side. Many Bestway models have a cap that unscrews. Once uncapped, you will see the valve opening.

Next, take your Bestway drain adapter. This small plastic piece usually screws directly into the drain valve. Make sure it is secure but do not overtighten it. Overtightening can damage the threads.

Now, attach one end of your garden hose to the adapter. Push the hose fitting firmly onto the adapter. If your hose has a standard quick-connect, it should snap into place. You can use a hose clamp for a tighter seal if desired. I usually give it a slight tug to ensure it is secure. This prevents leaks during draining.

### Initiating the Siphon

Once the hose is connected, place the other end of the hose at your chosen drainage spot. This spot must be lower than the pool's water level. Gravity is key here. The lower the hose end, the faster the water will flow. Make sure the hose end stays submerged if possible. This helps maintain the siphon.

Now, it is time to start the siphon. Open the drain valve on your Bestway pool. Water will begin to flow into the hose. You might hear a gurgling sound as the air escapes. Once water starts flowing out of the hose end, the siphon is active. The water will continue to drain on its own.

### Monitoring and Adjusting

Stay near the pool while it drains. Monitor the water flow from the hose. Ensure it is flowing steadily and not slowing down or stopping. If the flow stops, the siphon might have broken. You may need to reconnect the hose or adjust its position.

As the water level drops, the flow rate might decrease. This is normal as there is less pressure. You can try adjusting the hose end to be even lower if possible. This helps maintain a good flow. Ensure the hose does not kink. Kinks will stop the water flow completely.

You can also use this time to clean the pool's interior. As the water level drops, expose more of the liner. You can scrub away any remaining dirt or algae. This makes the final cleaning easier.

### Completing the Drain

The water will eventually stop flowing once it reaches the level of the drain valve. At this point, most of the water is out. There will be a small amount of residual water left. You can remove this remaining water with buckets or a wet/dry vacuum.

Once draining is complete, close the drain valve on your Bestway pool. Remove the hose and adapter. Store them properly for future use. This simple siphon method makes draining your Bestway pool with a hose a straightforward task.

## Alternative Draining Methods for Bestway Pools

While using a garden hose is simple, it is not the only way to drain your Bestway pool. Other methods can be faster or more suitable for specific situations. Understanding these options provides flexibility.

### Using a Submersible Pump

A submersible pump is a very effective tool for draining pools quickly. These pumps sit directly in the water. They have powerful motors that push water out through a hose. This method is much faster than relying on gravity.

To use a submersible pump, place it at the deepest part of your pool. Attach a discharge hose to the pump. This hose is usually wider than a garden hose, allowing for faster flow. Direct the hose to your chosen drainage spot. Plug in the pump, and it will start pumping water out. Some pumps can connect to standard garden hoses using adapters. This offers speed with familiar hose connections.

Submersible pumps are ideal for larger Bestway pools. They are also good if you need to drain the pool quickly. I find them particularly useful when preparing for winterization on a tight schedule. They can drain almost all the water, leaving very little behind.

### Manual Bailing and Siphoning with Buckets

For very small Bestway pools, or if you do not have a hose, manual bailing is an option. This involves simply scooping water out with buckets. It is labor-intensive but effective for tiny pools.

You can also create a basic siphon using a bucket and hose. Fill a bucket with pool water. Submerge one end of a garden hose into this bucket. Keep the other end outside the pool at a lower level. Suck briefly on the lower end of the hose to start the flow. Once water comes out, the siphon is established. This works like the direct hose method but offers a way to start the siphon without a direct drain valve connection.

### Utilizing a Sand Filter Backwash (If Applicable)

Some Bestway pools come with sand filters. If your Bestway pool uses a sand filter, you might be able to use its backwash function to drain water. This method is usually for lowering water levels, not fully draining.

To do this, set your sand filter valve to the "backwash" setting. Connect a backwash hose to the waste port. Direct this hose to your drainage area. Turn on the pool pump. Water will be expelled through the backwash hose. This process also cleans your filter sand. It is a good way to lower the water for maintenance or partial draining.

Each method has its pros and cons. The garden hose siphon is the easiest for most Bestway pools. Pumps offer speed. Manual methods are for small pools or emergencies. Choose the best method for your specific needs.

## Choosing the Right Drainage Spot

Deciding where to drain your Bestway pool water is critical. You must consider both environmental impact and local regulations. Improper water disposal can cause problems. I always make sure I have a safe and legal spot chosen.

The best place to drain water is often onto your lawn or garden. Pool water, especially if dechlorinated, can be beneficial for plants. It provides hydration, particularly during dry spells. Spread the water out to avoid saturation in one spot. Avoid draining large volumes directly onto delicate plants. This can wash them away or cause root rot.

However, be mindful of chlorine levels. If you have just super-chlorinated your pool, wait a few days before draining onto vegetation. High chlorine can harm or kill plants. Test the water first to ensure it is safe. Water should ideally have little to no chlorine before draining onto green spaces.

Never drain chlorinated pool water directly into storm drains. Storm drains typically lead to natural waterways like rivers, lakes, or oceans. Chlorine and other pool chemicals can harm aquatic life. Many municipalities have strict rules against this. Fines can be substantial. Always check your local bylaws regarding pool water disposal.

Avoid draining water near your home's foundation. Excess water can weaken the foundation over time. It can also lead to basement flooding or crawl space issues. Direct the hose away from buildings, concrete patios, and septic fields. Allow the water to soak into the ground far from structures.

Consider your neighbors' properties. Do not drain water into their yards. This can cause standing water issues or damage their landscaping. Always ensure the water flows only onto your property. Be a good neighbor by planning your drainage route carefully.

If you live in an area with a high water table, be careful. Adding a large volume of water to an already saturated ground can cause issues. It might lead to localized flooding. Choose an area that can absorb the water effectively.

For situations where direct yard drainage is not feasible, you might need professional help. Some areas have services that can collect and dispose of pool water. This is usually a last resort for Bestway pool owners. But it is an option if you face strict regulations or have no suitable drainage spot. Picking the right spot protects your property, the environment, and maintains good neighbor relations.

## Post-Drainage Care and Maintenance

Once your Bestway pool is drained, the work is not quite finished. Proper post-drainage care is essential. It ensures your pool stays in good condition. This step also prepares it for future use or storage.

First, thoroughly clean the pool liner. Even after draining, a thin layer of grime or residue might remain. Use a soft brush or sponge with a mild, non-abrasive cleaner. Scrub the bottom and walls of the pool. Pay attention to the waterline, where scum often accumulates. Rinse the liner with a garden hose to remove cleaner residue. Ensure all surfaces are spotless. [You might find tips on how to clean pool tile useful, even for liners](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pool-tile).

Inspect the liner for any small tears or punctures. It is easier to spot these when the pool is empty. If you find any, repair them immediately with a vinyl patch kit. Addressing small issues now prevents bigger problems later. A proper repair ensures the pool holds water next season.

Allow the pool liner to dry completely. This is a crucial step before folding or storing the pool. If you store a damp liner, mold and mildew can grow. This will damage the material and create unpleasant odors. Use old towels or a shop vac to remove any puddles. Let the sun and air do the rest of the drying. Ensure every part is bone dry.

If you are storing the pool for the season, deflate it carefully. Fold the liner neatly to prevent creases and cracks. Store the deflated pool in a cool, dry place. A garage, shed, or basement is ideal. Protect it from rodents and extreme temperatures. Using the original packaging or a large storage container can help.

Clean all accessories. This includes the filter pump, hoses, and ladder. Rinse them thoroughly and allow them to dry. Store pump components indoors to protect them from freezing temperatures. Proper care extends the life of your entire Bestway pool system. This also applies to pool deck drains; keeping them clear prevents issues. [Consider how to clean pool deck drain if you have one](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pool-deck-drain).

For future use, ensure the pool area is ready. Clear any lingering debris or old water. This makes setting up your Bestway pool next season much easier. Good post-drainage care makes a big difference in pool longevity.

## Troubleshooting Common Draining Issues

Even simple tasks like draining a Bestway pool with a hose can sometimes hit snags. Knowing how to troubleshoot common issues saves time and frustration. I have faced a few myself and learned quick fixes.

One frequent problem is slow drainage. If water is trickling out or the flow is much slower than expected, several things could be wrong. First, check the height difference. The end of your hose must be significantly lower than the pool's water level. If it is too high, gravity cannot do its job effectively. Adjust the hose end to a lower point.

Another cause of slow drainage is a kink in the hose. Walk along the entire length of the hose. Straighten any bends or twists. Kinks severely restrict water flow. Sometimes, the hose might be partially blocked. If you suspect an internal blockage, disconnect the hose from the pool. Run water through it from a tap to clear any debris. This is similar to cleaning a washing machine drain hose. [You can learn about how to clean drain hose on washing machine for ideas](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-drain-hose-on-washing-machine).

Sometimes, the siphon stops completely. This usually happens if air gets into the hose. The siphon needs a continuous column of water to work. If you see air bubbles or hear gurgling that stops the flow, you need to restart the siphon. Close the drain valve. Re-submerge the hose end fully in water, or try to fill the hose again. Then reopen the valve to re-establish the flow.

A clogged drain valve can also cause issues. Before draining, make sure the valve itself is clear. Sometimes, small debris like leaves or twigs can get stuck inside. Carefully inspect the valve opening. You might need to use a small tool to gently clear any obstructions. Be careful not to damage the valve.

If the hose connection leaks at the pool adapter, ensure the adapter is screwed on tightly. Also, check that your garden hose is securely attached. If the connection is loose, use a hose clamp to provide a tighter seal. A small leak might not stop the drain but can waste water and make a mess.

Finally, consider the pool's drain valve design. Some Bestway pools have drain valves that are very close to the bottom. This makes full gravity draining easy. Others might leave a small amount of standing water. If you cannot get all the water out via gravity, you will need a bucket or a wet/dry vacuum for the last bit.

By understanding these common draining problems and their solutions, you can keep your Bestway pool draining process smooth. Most issues are minor and easily fixable with a quick check and adjustment.

## When to Seek Professional Pool Draining Help

While draining your Bestway pool with a hose is a DIY-friendly task, there are times when professional help makes sense. Knowing when to call in experts can save you time, effort, and potential damage. Most Bestway pool owners can handle draining on their own, but exceptions exist.

One reason to call a professional is if your pool is exceptionally large. While Bestway pools are typically smaller above-ground models, some larger versions exist. Draining a very big pool with just a garden hose can take days. A professional service has powerful pumps and equipment. They can drain your pool much faster and more efficiently. This is especially true if you need the pool emptied quickly.

Another situation is persistent drainage issues. If you have tried all the troubleshooting steps and your pool still will not drain properly, a professional can diagnose the problem. They might find a more complex blockage in the drain system or an issue with the pool's structure. Their expertise ensures the problem gets fixed correctly.

Concerns about water disposal can also warrant professional help. If you live in an area with strict water disposal regulations, or if you have no suitable drainage area on your property, experts can assist. They know local laws. They can often arrange for safe and legal water removal. This prevents environmental fines or damage to your property.

If you are dealing with severely contaminated pool water, professionals are a good idea. Water with extreme chemical imbalances, hazardous algae, or even biological contamination should not go into your yard or storm drains. Pool service companies have the equipment to neutralize or properly dispose of such water. This protects your family and the environment.

Finally, consider your physical ability or time constraints. Draining a pool, even a Bestway, requires some lifting, moving hoses, and monitoring. If you are unable to perform these tasks, or if you simply do not have the time, hiring a professional is a practical solution. They handle the labor, letting you focus on other things.

For most Bestway pool owners, the simple garden hose method works perfectly. But recognizing when a task is beyond your scope is smart. Professionals offer peace of mind and specialized equipment for tough situations.
