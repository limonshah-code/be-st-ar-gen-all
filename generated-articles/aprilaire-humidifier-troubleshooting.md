### Main Query Answer

To troubleshoot your Aprilaire humidifier, start by checking the humidistat settings and ensuring the water supply valve is open. Next, inspect the water panel for clogs or damage. Verify power to the unit and clean any drain lines. These steps often resolve most common operational issues.

### No Humidification or Low Humidity Output

One of the most common issues with any humidifier, including Aprilaire models, is a lack of humidification. Your home might still feel dry, or the humidifier simply does not seem to add moisture to the air. This problem has several potential causes. We need to systematically check each component to find the root cause. This section will guide you through the initial diagnostic steps.

#### Checking Your Humidistat Settings

Your humidistat controls when the humidifier operates. It senses the indoor humidity level and tells the humidifier to turn on or off. If the setting is too low, the humidifier may not run enough to reach the desired humidity. Make sure the humidistat is set correctly, usually between 35% and 45% relative humidity for most homes. If you have an outdoor temperature sensor, ensure it is functioning correctly, as it helps prevent condensation on windows. A malfunctioning humidistat can cause many issues. Learn more about how to fix these problems by reading our guide on [Aprilaire Thermostat Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/aprilaire-thermostat-troubleshooting).

#### Inspecting the Water Panel (Evaporator Pad)

The water panel, also known as the evaporator pad, is a critical component. Water flows over this panel, and air passes through it, picking up moisture. Over time, mineral deposits can clog the water panel. A clogged panel cannot absorb water efficiently, leading to reduced humidification. I always recommend replacing the water panel annually, or more often if you have hard water. Check its condition; it should be clean and allow water to flow freely. A dirty or damaged panel is a primary cause of low humidity output. Understanding how to maintain this part is key. You can find detailed instructions on [how to clean an Aprilaire humidifier filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-aprilaire-humidifier-filter) on our website.

#### Water Supply Issues

Your Aprilaire humidifier needs a constant supply of water to operate. First, check the water shut-off valve on the supply line. Make sure it is fully open. Next, inspect the water supply line itself for kinks or blockages. Sometimes, sediment or mineral buildup can restrict water flow inside the line. If water is not reaching the humidifier, it cannot produce humidity. I often see this overlooked during initial checks. A quick visual inspection can save you a lot of time and effort.

#### Airflow Problems

The humidifier relies on airflow from your furnace or air handler to distribute moisture throughout your home. If there is insufficient airflow, the humidified air cannot circulate properly. Ensure your furnace blower is operating when the humidifier should be running. Check your furnace filter; a dirty furnace filter can significantly restrict airflow across the entire HVAC system, including your humidifier. Replace dirty furnace filters regularly to ensure optimal air circulation and efficient humidifier operation.

### Humidifier Not Turning On or No Power

It is frustrating when your Aprilaire humidifier does not turn on at all. This indicates a power supply problem or an issue with the control system. We need to systematically check all electrical connections and control components. Proper power flow is essential for any appliance. I will walk you through the diagnostic steps for power-related issues.

#### Power Supply Verification

First, ensure the humidifier is receiving power. Check the circuit breaker in your home's electrical panel. If it is tripped, reset it. Also, verify that the furnace or air handler, which often powers the humidifier, is turned on and functioning. Many Aprilaire humidifiers are wired directly into the furnace control board. Make sure the furnace switch is in the "on" position. Without proper power, the unit simply cannot operate.

#### Examining the Wiring

Loose or damaged wiring can prevent your humidifier from turning on. Carefully inspect all low-voltage wiring connections. Check the wires connecting the humidifier to the humidistat and to the furnace control board. Look for any frayed wires, loose terminals, or signs of corrosion. If you find any, they may need to be repaired or reconnected. Always turn off power to the furnace and humidifier before handling electrical wiring. Safety is always my top priority when dealing with electricity.

#### Troubleshooting the Humidistat

The humidistat acts as the brain of your humidifier system. If it is faulty, it might not signal the humidifier to turn on, even if the humidity level is low. Try setting the humidistat to a very high setting (e.g., 60% or "Test" mode if available) to see if the humidifier kicks on. If it does not, the humidistat might be defective and require replacement. Sometimes, calibrating the humidistat can resolve minor issues. Our guide on [Aprilaire Thermostat Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/aprilaire-thermostat-troubleshooting) has more details that apply to humidistats too.

#### Furnace Blower Check

Most Aprilaire humidifiers are designed to operate only when the furnace blower is running, especially bypass models. This ensures that the humidified air is distributed through your ductwork. If your furnace blower is not turning on, your humidifier will not operate. Check if your furnace is receiving power and if the thermostat is calling for heat or fan operation. If the furnace blower motor is not working, that is a separate issue that needs addressing first. The humidifier depends on this airflow for proper function.

### Continuous Water Flow or Leaking

Water leaks or continuous water flow are serious issues. They can lead to water damage, mold growth, and wasted water. Identifying the source of the leak quickly is crucial. Aprilaire humidifiers are designed to manage water flow precisely. Any deviation indicates a problem with a specific component. I will guide you through diagnosing common causes of leaks and constant water flow.

#### Solenoid Valve Malfunction

The solenoid valve controls the water flow into the humidifier. It opens when the humidifier needs water and closes when it does not. If the solenoid valve is stuck open or faulty, water will continuously flow into the humidifier and often directly down the drain. This wastes a lot of water and can over-humidify your home. You might hear a constant trickle of water even when the humidifier should be off. A faulty solenoid valve typically needs replacement. This is a common part to fail over time due to mineral buildup.

#### Drain Line Blockage

Aprilaire humidifiers, especially models with a drain line, use this line to remove excess water or water containing mineral deposits. If the drain line becomes clogged, water cannot flow out properly. This causes water to back up and overflow from the humidifier. Check the drain line for any kinks, blockages, or debris. You can often clear a blockage using a small brush or by flushing the line with water. Ensuring the drain line has a proper slope is also important for effective drainage. Keeping this line clear is essential for preventing overflows.

#### Improper Water Panel Installation

The water panel must be installed correctly within its housing. If it is not seated properly, water may bypass the panel and leak directly into the drain pan or even outside the unit. This can lead to inefficient humidification and leaks. Always refer to your humidifier's manual for precise installation instructions for the water panel. I have seen many cases where a simple re-seating of the water panel resolved a significant leak. Proper installation is key. For more tips, refer to our article on [how to clean Aprilaire humidifier filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-aprilaire-humidifier-filter), which also covers replacement.

#### Overflow Pan Issues

Some Aprilaire models have an overflow pan designed to catch excess water. If this pan becomes cracked or damaged, it can leak. Periodically inspect the overflow pan for any visible cracks or signs of wear. While less common, a damaged pan will require replacement. Also, ensure the pan is properly seated and not dislodged. Addressing pan integrity is important for containing any unexpected water.

### Humidifier Making Strange Noises

A well-functioning Aprilaire humidifier should operate quietly. Any unusual noises—such as grinding, rattling, humming, or squealing—indicate a problem. These noises often point to mechanical issues with the fan motor or water flow components. Ignoring strange noises can lead to more serious damage. I will help you identify the source of these sounds and propose solutions.

#### Fan Motor Issues

Many Aprilaire models use a fan to draw air through the water panel. If this fan motor is failing, it can produce grinding, squealing, or humming noises. These sounds often intensify as the motor struggles. A motor that is about to fail might also draw excessive power or stop working altogether. Inspect the fan blades for any obstructions or debris that might be causing the noise. Lubricating the motor bearings (if accessible and recommended by the manufacturer) can sometimes resolve squealing, but often a noisy motor needs replacement.

#### Water Flow Noises

Certain noises relate directly to water movement within the humidifier. A constant trickling sound, even when the unit is off, suggests a leaky solenoid valve. Gurgling or bubbling noises might indicate issues with the drain line or water pan, such as partial blockages or improper water levels. Listen closely to pinpoint where the sound originates. A steady, gentle hum from water flowing is normal, but anything louder or irregular warrants investigation. Clearing drain lines often resolves gurgling sounds.

#### Loose Components

Vibrations can cause various components within the humidifier to become loose over time. This includes covers, housing panels, or internal mounts. Loose parts can rattle or buzz when the humidifier operates. Carefully inspect the entire unit, gently pressing on different parts to see if the noise changes or stops. Tighten any screws or fasteners that appear loose. This simple check can often eliminate irritating rattling noises and improve the unit's stability.

#### Bearing Lubrication

Some older or heavy-duty Aprilaire models may have fan motors with accessible bearings that benefit from occasional lubrication. If the bearings are dry, they can produce a high-pitched squeal. Consult your humidifier's manual to determine if your model's fan motor bearings are designed for lubrication. If so, apply a few drops of light machine oil specifically designed for electric motors. This can extend the life of the motor and quiet its operation. Always power down the unit before attempting any lubrication.

### Aprilaire Humidifier Producing Too Much Humidity

While low humidity is a common complaint, some homes experience the opposite: excessive humidity from their Aprilaire unit. Too much humidity can lead to condensation on windows, mold growth, and a generally uncomfortable, clammy feeling. This issue often stems from a control problem or a component stuck in an "on" position. I will help you identify why your humidifier might be over-humidifying your home.

#### Humidistat Calibration

The humidistat controls the humidifier's operation by sensing the relative humidity. If the humidistat is miscalibrated, it might consistently read lower than the actual humidity. This causes the humidifier to run more often or for longer periods than necessary. Some humidistats allow for calibration adjustments. Refer to your owner's manual for specific instructions. If calibration does not help, the humidistat might be faulty and needs replacement. Proper calibration ensures accurate humidity sensing. Understanding how your control works is key. Check out [Aprilaire Thermostat Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/aprilaire-thermostat-troubleshooting) for more details on controls.

#### Water Panel Condition

While a clogged water panel causes *low* humidity, a *new* or very clean water panel can sometimes contribute to high humidity if the controls are not adjusted properly. Also, if the water panel is not draining properly or is constantly saturated, it can lead to over-saturation of the air. Ensure the water panel is seated correctly and that water can drain from it efficiently when the unit is off. An overly saturated panel provides too much evaporative surface.

#### Solenoid Valve Stuck Open

As mentioned earlier regarding continuous water flow, a solenoid valve that is stuck in the open position will allow water to flow into the humidifier constantly. This means the humidifier is always receiving water, even when the humidistat calls for it to stop. This continuous water supply, especially in bypass or fan-powered models, leads to uncontrolled humidification. The only reliable fix for a stuck-open solenoid valve is to replace it. This is a common culprit for consistent over-humidification.

### Odors Coming From Your Humidifier

A humidifier should provide clean, healthy moisture to your home. If you notice musty, stale, or chemical odors coming from your Aprilaire unit, it is a clear sign that something is wrong. Odors often indicate bacterial growth, mold, or mineral buildup within the system. Addressing these smells quickly is important for your indoor air quality and health. I will explain how to eliminate these unpleasant scents.

#### Cleaning the Water Panel and Tray

The most common cause of odors is a dirty water panel or a dirty water collection tray. Over time, mineral deposits, dust, and even mold can accumulate on these surfaces. This provides a breeding ground for bacteria and mold, which produce unpleasant, musty smells. Regular cleaning of the water tray and replacing the water panel are crucial. I recommend following the manufacturer's cleaning guidelines. You can find detailed instructions specifically for your Aprilaire model on [how to clean an Aprilaire humidifier filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-aprilaire-humidifier-filter), which typically includes cleaning the entire internal system.

#### Addressing Mold and Mildew

Mold and mildew thrive in damp, dark environments, making the inside of a humidifier a prime location. If you see black, green, or fuzzy growth, you have mold. Cleaning with a bleach solution (1 part bleach to 10 parts water) or a vinegar solution (equal parts vinegar and water) can kill mold. Always rinse thoroughly after cleaning to remove any residue. Ensure the unit dries completely before reassembling. Regular cleaning prevents mold from taking hold.

#### Water Quality

The quality of the water you use in your humidifier also plays a role. Hard water, rich in minerals, can leave behind scale and provide nutrients for microbial growth. If your home has very hard water, consider using a whole-house water softener or installing a pre-filter for the humidifier's water supply. While Aprilaire humidifiers are designed to handle various water qualities, better input water can reduce buildup and odors over time. I always tell my clients that prevention is better than cure.

### Specific Model Considerations (Aprilaire 700/800)

Aprilaire offers various humidifier models, and while many troubleshooting steps apply broadly, some specific issues or common problems are more prevalent in certain models. The Aprilaire 700 and 800 series are popular fan-powered and steam humidifiers, respectively, each with its own quirks. Understanding these model-specific considerations can help in more targeted troubleshooting. I will highlight key points for these two prominent series.

#### Aprilaire Model 700 Common Issues

The Aprilaire Model 700 is a fan-powered humidifier, meaning it has its own internal fan to push humidified air into the ductwork. Common issues with this model often relate to its fan motor or water distribution system. If you experience low humidity, check the fan's operation and ensure it spins freely. Water panel issues are also very common. The model 700 also includes a water-level sensor, which can sometimes malfunction and lead to overfilling or no water. Diagnosing these specific components can resolve many performance problems. You can find a dedicated resource for resolving issues with this specific unit in our comprehensive [Aprilaire 700 Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/aprilaire-700-troubleshooting) guide.

#### Aprilaire Model 800 Specific Faults
