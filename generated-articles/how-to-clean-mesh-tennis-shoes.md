## Restore Your Mesh Tennis Shoes: A Complete Cleaning Guide

Mesh tennis shoes are popular. They offer great comfort and breathability. However, their open weave design makes them prone to collecting dirt and debris. This can make them look dull and old quickly. Knowing **how to clean mesh tennis shoes** properly is important. It helps maintain their appearance and extends their life.

Dirty shoes can also hold bacteria and odors. Regular cleaning keeps your footwear fresh and hygienic. This guide provides simple, step-by-step instructions. We will cover preparation, different cleaning methods, and proper drying techniques. You will also find tips for keeping your shoes clean longer. My goal is to help you restore your favorite mesh tennis shoes.

### Takeaway

Keeping your mesh tennis shoes clean involves simple steps.
*   Always remove loose dirt first.
*   Hand wash them with mild soap and a soft brush.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach.

**How to clean mesh tennis shoes?**
You clean mesh tennis shoes by first removing loose dirt. Then, you hand wash them using a mild soap and a soft brush. Rinse thoroughly with cool water. Finally, air dry them away from direct sunlight or heat, often by stuffing them with paper towels to absorb moisture and maintain shape.

## Understanding Mesh Materials and Their Unique Needs

Mesh is a common material in tennis shoes. It is lightweight and allows air to move freely. This keeps your feet cool and comfortable during activity. Manufacturers use different types of mesh. Some mesh is woven tightly. Other types are more open, like a net. These differences affect how dirt gets trapped.

Because mesh has small openings, dirt, dust, and grime can easily get embedded. This makes mesh shoes harder to clean than solid materials like leather. Dirt can also get deeper into the fabric. If you do not clean mesh properly, you risk damaging the material. Harsh scrubbing or strong chemicals can fray the mesh. They can also cause discoloration.

Many people wonder about cleaning specific brands. Whether you own Nike, Brooks, or On Cloud shoes, the basic principles for cleaning mesh remain the same. These brands use various mesh technologies. Still, gentle care is always the best approach. My advice applies broadly to most mesh tennis shoes. Understanding the material is the first step towards successful cleaning. This knowledge helps you choose the right tools and methods. It prevents damage and keeps your shoes looking great.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Arsenal: What You Need

Before you start cleaning your mesh tennis shoes, gather all necessary supplies. Having everything ready makes the process smooth. You likely have most of these items at home already. Using the right tools protects your shoes from harm. It also ensures a thorough clean.

Here is a list of supplies I recommend:
*   **Soft-bristled brush or old toothbrush:** These are gentle on mesh. They help scrub away dirt without damaging the fabric.
*   **Mild soap:** Dish soap or laundry detergent works well. Avoid strong chemicals. You can also use a dedicated shoe cleaner.
*   **Baking soda:** This is excellent for odor removal. It also helps with light stains.
*   **White vinegar:** A natural deodorizer and stain remover. Mix it with water.
*   **Microfiber cloths or soft towels:** Use these for wiping and drying.
*   **Small bowls or buckets:** For mixing cleaning solutions and holding water.
*   **Laundry bag (optional):** If you plan to machine wash, which I advise against for mesh shoes.
*   **Paper towels or old newspapers:** For stuffing shoes to maintain shape during drying.
*   **Shoe protector spray (optional):** To prevent future stains after cleaning.

Do not use abrasive sponges or stiff brushes. They can fray or tear the mesh fabric. Avoid bleach unless specifically recommended for white shoes and heavily diluted. Even then, test it on a small, hidden area first. Your shoes will thank you for using gentle products. Getting these items ready saves time. It also prepares you for effective cleaning.

## The Pre-Clean Routine: Preparing Your Mesh Shoes

A good start makes cleaning mesh tennis shoes much easier. Skipping the pre-clean can push dirt deeper into the fabric. This makes it harder to remove later. This routine is simple but important. It prepares your shoes for a deeper clean.

First, remove your shoelaces and insoles. Laces can be cleaned separately. Insoles absorb a lot of sweat and odor. They often need their own cleaning. Set them aside. We will address them later.

Next, remove loose dirt. Bang the soles of your shoes together outside. This knocks off large clumps of mud or dirt. You can also use a dry soft-bristled brush. Gently brush off any surface dirt from the mesh and soles. Pay attention to the grooves in the sole. Dirt often hides there. A toothpick or a small stick can help dislodge pebbles or compacted mud.

Do not skip this step. Removing dry, loose dirt prevents it from turning into muddy smears when you add water. It also protects your cleaning tools. You will avoid pushing abrasive particles into the delicate mesh. Preparing your shoes correctly ensures a more effective and safer cleaning process. My experience shows this step saves time in the long run.

### Cleaning Laces and Insoles

While your shoes are airing out, clean the laces and insoles.
*   **Laces:** Put them in a small bowl with warm water and a little mild soap. Rub them together to remove dirt. Rinse them well and let them air dry.
*   **Insoles:** Sprinkle baking soda on them to absorb odors. Let them sit for a few hours or overnight. For a deeper clean, gently scrub them with a soft brush and mild soap. Rinse them well. Squeeze out excess water and let them air dry completely. Make sure they are fully dry before putting them back in your shoes.

## Hand-Cleaning Mesh Tennis Shoes: The Gentle Approach

Hand-cleaning is the safest and most effective method for mesh tennis shoes. It gives you control over the scrubbing pressure. This prevents damage to the delicate mesh. I always recommend this method. It is easy and yields great results. This process helps you maintain various types of mesh, whether you are trying to [clean white mesh tennis shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-mesh-tennis-shoes) or a darker pair.

Start by mixing a small amount of mild soap with warm water in a bowl. About one teaspoon of soap per cup of water is usually enough. You want a foamy solution, not too sudsy. Dip your soft-bristled brush or old toothbrush into this solution. Do not saturate the brush too much.

Gently scrub the mesh parts of your shoes. Use small, circular motions. Work on one small section at a time. The goal is to lift the dirt, not push it deeper. For tough spots, apply a little more pressure. Be careful around seams and glued areas. These parts can be more fragile. Remember, this approach works for many specific brands too. You can adapt it for [cleaning Nike mesh shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-nike-mesh-shoes) or when you want to [clean Brooks running shoes mesh](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-brooks-running-shoes-mesh).

After scrubbing a section, wipe away the dirty suds with a clean, damp microfiber cloth. Rinse the cloth often. Repeat this process until the mesh looks clean. For the rubber soles and harder parts, you can use a bit more soap solution and a firmer scrub. This method is generally effective for [how to clean any type of tennis shoe](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-tennis-shoes) that features mesh. Be thorough but gentle.

### Rinse and Inspect

Once you finish scrubbing all areas, use a clean, damp cloth to wipe down the entire shoe again. This removes any soap residue. Soap left on the mesh can attract more dirt later. It can also leave streaks. Rinse the cloth frequently under running water. Ensure all suds are gone from the shoe. Hold the shoe up to the light to check for any missed spots or remaining dirt. If you see more dirt, repeat the cleaning process on those areas. This careful rinsing prevents residue buildup. It also helps your shoes dry without stiffness.

## Tackling Tough Stains and Odors on Mesh Tennis Shoes

Sometimes, regular hand-cleaning is not enough. Mesh tennis shoes can get stubborn stains or develop persistent odors. These problems need special attention. Do not worry; there are simple solutions for these challenges. I have used these methods successfully on many occasions.

For tough stains, you can create a paste. Mix baking soda with a small amount of water. This forms a thick paste. Apply the paste directly to the stain. Gently rub it in with your soft brush. Let the paste sit on the stain for 15-30 minutes. Baking soda is a natural abrasive and stain lifter. After it sits, gently scrub the area again. Then, wipe away the paste with a damp cloth. This method works well for many types of discoloration. If you are dealing with particularly stubborn spots, a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water can also be effective. Apply it directly, let it sit, then scrub and rinse.

Odors are common in mesh shoes due to sweat and bacteria. Baking soda is your best friend here. After cleaning and drying, sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda inside each shoe. Let it sit overnight, or even for 24 hours. The baking soda absorbs the smells. Then, simply dump out the powder. You can also put baking soda in old socks or sachets and leave them in your shoes when not in use. For strong odors that might suggest mold, you might need a more specialized approach. Refer to guides on how to [remove mold from shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-shoes) if you suspect mold is the issue.

Another tip for odors is tea bags. Place a dry, unused tea bag inside each shoe overnight. They absorb moisture and odors. Essential oils, like tea tree oil or lavender, can also help. Put a few drops on a cotton ball and leave it inside the shoe for a few hours. These methods keep your mesh shoes smelling fresh and clean, ready for your next activity.

## Machine Washing Mesh Tennis Shoes: Is It Safe? (Use with Caution)

Many people ask if they can put mesh tennis shoes in the washing machine. My answer is always: use extreme caution, and only as a last resort. Hand-washing is always the gentlest and safest method for mesh. Machine washing can cause damage. It can shrink your shoes. It can also weaken adhesives. This might make your shoes fall apart sooner.

If you absolutely must machine wash your mesh tennis shoes, follow these specific steps. This minimizes the risks. First, perform the pre-clean routine. Remove laces and insoles. Knock off any loose dirt. Do not skip this step. Putting very dirty shoes in the machine can spread the dirt. It can also clog your machine.

Next, place your shoes inside a mesh laundry bag. This protects them from hitting the sides of the washing machine drum. It also keeps laces or other small parts from getting tangled. You can also add a few old towels to the wash. The towels act as a buffer. They cushion the shoes during the cycle. This further prevents damage.

Use only cold water. Hot water can cause shrinkage and break down glues. Select the delicate or gentle cycle on your washing machine. Use a small amount of mild liquid detergent. Avoid powder detergents, as they can leave residue. Do not use bleach or fabric softener. Bleach can damage mesh. Fabric softener can leave a film. After the cycle finishes, remove your shoes immediately. Do not put them in the dryer. Machine washing should not be your first choice. But if you do it, do it very carefully.

## Safe Drying Practices for Mesh Tennis Shoes

Proper drying is as important as proper cleaning. Mesh tennis shoes need to dry completely to prevent odor and mold. Incorrect drying can also damage the material. It can cause shrinkage or misshaping. Always air dry your mesh shoes. Never use a machine dryer. High heat is very bad for shoe materials, especially mesh and adhesives.

After washing, gently squeeze out any excess water from your shoes. Do not wring or twist them forcefully. This can distort their shape. Then, stuff your shoes with paper towels or old newspapers. This helps absorb moisture from the inside. It also helps the shoes keep their original shape as they dry. Change the paper every few hours if it becomes very damp.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area. A spot with good airflow is ideal. Keep them away from direct sunlight. Direct sun can fade colors. It can also cause the mesh to become brittle over time. Avoid placing them near direct heat sources. These include radiators, space heaters, or hair dryers. Extreme heat can shrink the mesh. It can also melt or weaken the glues that hold the shoe together.

Drying time varies. It depends on how wet your shoes are and the humidity in your environment. It can take anywhere from 12 to 48 hours for shoes to dry completely. Make sure they are bone dry before you wear them again. Wearing damp shoes promotes bacterial growth. This leads to bad odors. My best advice is patience. Let your shoes dry naturally and thoroughly. This ensures they stay fresh and last longer.

## Extending the Life of Your Mesh Tennis Shoes: Aftercare & Prevention

Cleaning your mesh tennis shoes is a great start. But keeping them clean and in good condition requires ongoing care. Aftercare and prevention are key to extending the life of your favorite footwear. Small habits can make a big difference. This section offers tips for maintaining your shoes after they are sparkling clean.

First, consider applying a shoe protector spray. These sprays create a barrier on the mesh. This barrier helps repel water and stains. It makes it harder for dirt to stick to the fabric. Look for sprays designed for breathable materials like mesh. Always follow the product instructions. Usually, you spray it evenly on clean, dry shoes. Let them dry completely before wearing. Reapply the spray periodically, especially after deep cleaning. This adds an extra layer of defense.

Store your shoes properly when not in use. Keep them in a cool, dry place. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or damp areas. A shoe rack or shoe box works well. This prevents dust buildup and protects them from moisture. If you wear them often, consider rotating your shoes. Having more than one pair allows each pair to air out and dry completely between uses. This significantly reduces odor and wear.

Regular, light cleaning is better than infrequent deep cleans. If your shoes get a little dirty, wipe them down immediately. Do not let dirt sit on the mesh for too long. A quick brush or wipe can prevent stains from setting in. For light mud, let it dry first. Then, brush it off. This simple habit will reduce the need for intensive cleaning. My shoes last much longer when I take these small steps. You will find it easier to keep your mesh tennis shoes looking new for many months.
