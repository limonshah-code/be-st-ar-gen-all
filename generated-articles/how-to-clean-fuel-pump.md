Choosing a reputable gas station helps. They typically offer good quality fuel. This small choice can make a big difference over time.

Second, **do not run your fuel tank too low**. Your fuel pump is often inside the fuel tank. The fuel surrounding it helps keep it cool. Running on a very low tank exposes the pump. It can overheat. It also increases the chances of picking up sediment. Most contaminants settle at the bottom of the tank. Try to refuel when your tank is a quarter full. This keeps the pump submerged.

Third, **change your fuel filter regularly**. The fuel filter is your first line of defense. It catches dirt, rust, and debris before they reach your fuel pump. A clogged filter makes the pump work harder. This can lead to premature failure. Check your car's owner's manual for recommended replacement intervals. This simple maintenance step protects your entire fuel system.

Fourth, **use fuel system cleaners periodically**. Even with good fuel, some deposits can form. A bottle of fuel system cleaner every few oil changes helps. It dissolves minor buildup before it becomes a problem. This keeps your fuel pump and injectors clean. This is an easy and cost-effective way to maintain your fuel system.

Finally, **address any engine warning lights promptly**. If your check engine light comes on, investigate it. It might signal a fuel system issue. Early detection can prevent minor issues from becoming major repairs. Ignoring warnings can lead to damage. Following these preventive steps saves you money. It also keeps your car running smoothly for years.
