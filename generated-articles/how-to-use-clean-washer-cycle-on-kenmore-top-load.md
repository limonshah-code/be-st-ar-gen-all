## Clean Your Kenmore Top Load Washer: A Step-by-Step Guide

Your Kenmore top load washing machine works hard. It cleans your clothes day after day. Over time, residue can build up inside. This buildup can cause bad smells and affect cleaning performance. Knowing how to use the clean washer cycle on your Kenmore top load is important. This cycle helps keep your machine fresh. It stops odors before they start. It ensures your clothes come out truly clean. This guide will show you exactly how to do it. We will cover preparing your washer, running the cycle, and maintaining it for the long term.

### Takeaway

*   **Run the clean cycle monthly:** Prevent buildup and odors.
*   **Use the correct cleaning agent:** Affresh tablets, liquid bleach, or vinegar are good choices.
*   **Remove all items:** Ensure the washer drum is empty before starting.
*   **Clean manually:** Wipe down the dispenser, lid, and drum rim after the cycle.
*   **Air dry:** Leave the lid open after use to prevent moisture.

### How do I use the clean washer cycle on my Kenmore top load washing machine?

To use the clean washer cycle on a Kenmore top load, ensure the drum is empty. Add your chosen cleaning agent, such as a washer cleaner tablet or liquid bleach, into the dispenser or directly into the tub. Select the "Clean Washer" or "Affresh" cycle on your machine's control panel. Start the cycle and allow it to complete fully.

## Why Your Kenmore Top Load Washer Needs Regular Cleaning

Have you ever wondered why your washing machine starts to smell? It is a common problem. Your Kenmore top load washer, like all washers, can develop residue. This residue comes from detergent, fabric softener, and dirt from clothes. Over time, these residues combine with moisture. This creates a perfect environment for mildew and bacteria. These are the main culprits behind those unpleasant odors.

Regular cleaning prevents these issues. The clean washer cycle specifically targets these internal buildups. It flushes out hidden gunk and helps sanitize the drum. Think of it as a deep cleaning for your appliance. This helps your machine last longer. It also ensures your laundry smells fresh and truly clean. Ignoring regular cleaning can lead to poor washing performance. Your clothes might not get as clean. They might even pick up a musty smell. So, a small effort now saves bigger problems later. We want your Kenmore washer to always work its best.

This cycle uses hot water and specific actions. These actions are designed to loosen and flush away deposits. It is more powerful than a regular wash cycle. It does not just clean clothes; it cleans the machine itself. Many modern Kenmore models have this feature built right in. It makes maintenance easy and accessible. Using it is a simple step to protect your investment. It helps you get the best results from your laundry routine. Do not wait for bad smells to appear. Start a regular cleaning schedule today. This keeps your washer in top shape.

## Preparing Your Kenmore Washer for a Clean Cycle

Starting with a prepared machine makes the clean cycle more effective. This step is simple but very important. It ensures the cycle can do its job fully. I always tell people to take a few minutes for this preparation. It helps achieve the best cleaning results.

First, you must ensure the washer drum is completely empty. Check for any forgotten items like socks or small towels. Even a single item can absorb the cleaning solution. This makes the cycle less effective. The clean cycle is for the machine, not for clothes. So, empty the drum completely.

Next, focus on the dispenser drawers. Your Kenmore top load washer has compartments for detergent and fabric softener. These can accumulate residue. Pull out the dispenser drawer if possible. Wipe down any visible gunk with a damp cloth. If the drawer does not come out, wipe the accessible areas. You want to clear any old product buildup. This allows the cleaning agent to reach all parts of the system.

Check the tub rim and the underside of the lid. These areas often collect lint, hair, and soap scum. Use a damp cloth to wipe them clean. A little elbow grease here makes a big difference. This prevents loose debris from interfering with the clean cycle. It also ensures these often-missed spots get attention. Preparing your washer correctly sets the stage for a thorough cleaning. It is like sweeping before mopping; it just makes sense. Taking these quick steps ensures your Kenmore top load washer is ready. It will get the most benefit from its dedicated cleaning cycle.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Running the Clean Washer Cycle

Now, let's get to the main event: running the clean washer cycle on your Kenmore top load machine. This process is straightforward. However, the exact button names might vary slightly by model. Always check your washer's user manual for precise instructions if you are unsure. Most Kenmore top load models follow a similar pattern.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Empty the Washer Drum:** As discussed, ensure no clothes or items are inside the washer. The drum must be empty for the clean cycle to work correctly. This is the first and most critical step.

2.  **Add Cleaning Agent:**
    *   **Option 1: Washer Cleaner Tablet (e.g., Affresh):** Place one tablet directly into the bottom of the empty washer drum. Do not put it in the dispenser. These tablets are designed to dissolve slowly during the cycle. Many Kenmore washers have an "Affresh" cycle button, which is specifically designed for these tablets.
    *   **Option 2: Liquid Chlorine Bleach:** If your Kenmore model does not recommend tablets or you prefer bleach, add up to 1 cup (240 mL) of liquid chlorine bleach. Pour the bleach into the bleach dispenser compartment. Do not pour it directly into the drum, as it might splash or cause damage to certain finishes. Bleach is a powerful disinfectant and helps remove odors. You can also learn how to clean your washer with vinegar if you prefer a natural option, though it is usually not used *during* the official clean cycle.
    *   **Option 3: White Vinegar:** Some Kenmore models allow white vinegar for the clean cycle. Add 2 cups (480 mL) of distilled white vinegar directly to the detergent dispenser. Vinegar is a natural descaler and deodorizer. It helps break down mineral deposits and soap scum.
    *   You should only use one cleaning agent per cycle. Do not mix bleach and vinegar, as this creates dangerous fumes.

3.  **Select the Clean Washer Cycle:**
    *   Look for a button labeled "Clean Washer," "Affresh," or "Tub Clean." It is often located on the main control panel.
    *   Press this button to select the dedicated cleaning cycle.
    *   Some older Kenmore models might not have a dedicated button. In that case, select the "Hot" water setting and the "Deep Water Wash" or "Bulky Items" cycle, if available. This provides a long, hot wash which can mimic the clean cycle action.

4.  **Start the Cycle:**
    *   Once the cycle is selected, press the "Start/Pause" or "Start" button.
    *   The washer will begin filling with water. It will then agitate and drain multiple times. The cycle typically takes longer than a regular wash, often an hour or more.
    *   Do not interrupt the cycle. Allow it to run its full course. This ensures a complete cleaning process.

5.  **Wipe Down After Cycle (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   After the cycle finishes, open the washer lid.
    *   Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe down the inside of the drum. Pay attention to the top rim and any areas above the water line.
    *   Wipe the dispenser drawers again.
    *   This step removes any lingering residue or grime that the cycle loosened but did not completely rinse away.

Running the clean washer cycle is a key part of maintaining your Kenmore top load washing machine. It prevents odors and keeps your laundry fresh. This also helps you avoid issues like those covered in articles about [how to clean a smelly washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-washer). Regular execution of this cycle keeps your appliance running efficiently and your clothes smelling great.

## Optimal Cleaning Solutions for Your Kenmore Top Loader

Choosing the right cleaning agent is crucial for an effective clean washer cycle. Different solutions offer unique benefits. Your Kenmore top load washer manual might recommend a specific product. Always check it first. However, several popular and effective options exist. I find that rotating between options sometimes works best.

### Affresh Washer Cleaner Tablets

Affresh tablets are specifically designed for washing machine cleaning. Many Kenmore top load washers even have a dedicated "Affresh" cycle button. These tablets work by dissolving slowly. They release powerful cleaning agents. These agents break down odor-causing residues. This includes detergent buildup and soap scum. They target the parts of the washer you cannot see. This ensures a thorough internal cleaning.

**How to use:**
*   Place one Affresh tablet directly into the empty washer drum.
*   Do not put it in the dispenser.
*   Select the "Clean Washer" or "Affresh" cycle.
*   Start the cycle and let it finish.
*   Affresh is safe for all septic systems. It is also safe for metal and plastic parts in your washer.

### Liquid Chlorine Bleach

Liquid chlorine bleach is a strong disinfectant. It effectively kills bacteria and mildew. This makes it excellent for odor removal. Bleach can sanitize the washer drum and internal components. It is a powerful option for deep cleaning. Be careful when using bleach.

**How to use:**
*   Add up to 1 cup (240 mL) of regular liquid chlorine bleach.
*   Pour it into the bleach dispenser compartment. Never pour it directly into the drum.
*   Select the "Clean Washer" cycle or a "Hot" water "Deep Clean" cycle.
*   Start the cycle.
*   Ensure the area is well-ventilated when using bleach. Do not mix bleach with other cleaners like ammonia or vinegar, as this creates toxic gases.

### Distilled White Vinegar

White vinegar is a natural cleaning agent. It is an acid. This acid helps dissolve mineral deposits and soap scum. It also acts as a natural deodorizer. Vinegar is a good choice for those who prefer a less harsh chemical. Many people also use vinegar to address specific problems, for instance, learning [how to clean washer with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-with-vinegar) for general upkeep.

**How to use:**
*   Pour 2 cups (480 mL) of distilled white vinegar into the detergent dispenser.
*   Alternatively, pour it directly into the empty washer drum.
*   Select the "Clean Washer" cycle or a "Hot" water "Deep Water Wash" cycle.
*   Start the cycle.
*   Vinegar is safe for most washing machine components. It leaves no strong residual smell once rinsed away.

### Combination (e.g., Baking Soda and Vinegar)

Some people combine baking soda with vinegar for manual cleaning steps. For the dedicated clean washer cycle, it's generally best to stick to one product. Baking soda is an excellent odor absorber. It can boost the cleaning power when applied manually.

**For manual use (not during the cycle):**
*   Sprinkle 1/2 cup of baking soda into the empty drum.
*   Then add 2 cups of white vinegar to the dispenser.
*   Run a regular hot water cycle. This is more for a basic rinse and deodorize, not the deep clean cycle itself.

Always choose the cleaning agent that best suits your needs. Consider your washer's recommendations and your personal preference. Regular use of one of these solutions will keep your Kenmore top load washer clean and smelling fresh. This helps prevent issues such as stubborn residue around the agitator, a problem often addressed when learning [how to clean a washer agitator](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-agitator).

## Beyond the Cycle: Manual Cleaning for Kenmore Top Loaders

While the dedicated clean washer cycle handles internal components, some areas of your Kenmore top load washer need manual attention. These spots accumulate grime and residue that the cycle might miss. Neglecting them can still lead to odors and reduced performance. I always make sure to give these areas a quick wipe-down after every few loads, or at least after a clean cycle. This ensures every part of the machine is spotless.

### Cleaning the Detergent and Fabric Softener Dispensers

These dispensers are prime spots for buildup. Detergent and fabric softener can dry and harden in these compartments. This creates a sticky film. This film can trap dirt and even grow mold.

**How to clean:**
*   Remove the dispenser drawer if your model allows it. Many Kenmore top loaders have removable trays.
*   Wash the drawer under hot running water. Use an old toothbrush or a small brush to scrub away residue.
*   You can soak stubborn buildup in warm, soapy water for 30 minutes.
*   Rinse thoroughly and dry.
*   If the drawer is not removable, use a damp cloth and a small brush to clean inside the compartments. Pay close attention to corners and crevices.
*   This also applies to other top-load washers, just like when you're looking into cleaning tips for a [Maytag top load washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-maytag-top-load-washer).

### Wiping Down the Tub Rim and Lid Underside

The top rim of the washer tub and the underside of the lid are often forgotten. Water splashes onto these surfaces during a wash cycle. It leaves behind soap residue and lint. This area stays damp for long periods. This encourages mildew growth.

**How to clean:**
*   Open the washer lid fully.
*   Use a clean cloth dampened with a mild all-purpose cleaner or a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar.
*   Wipe down the entire tub rim. Reach underneath the rim if possible.
*   W Clean the entire underside of the lid, including hinges and any crevices.
*   Ensure these areas are dry after cleaning to prevent immediate regrowth of mold.

### Addressing the Agitator (If Applicable)

Some Kenmore top loaders feature an agitator. The agitator column can also hide grime. Water and detergent splash up into the base of the agitator. This creates a buildup spot. This is similar to considerations for cleaning other major brands like when someone might search for [how to clean an LG top load washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-lg-top-load-washer).

**How to clean:**
*   Check if your agitator unscrews or lifts out. Refer to your manual.
*   If it does, remove it and clean its base and the washer drum area beneath it. Use a brush to scrub away any slime or residue.
*   If it is fixed, use a long-handled brush or a damp cloth wrapped around a stick. Reach down around the agitator's base.
*   Wipe it clean, removing any visible gunk.

### Cleaning the Exterior and Control Panel

Do not forget the outside of your washer. The exterior can gather dust and spills. The control panel can accumulate fingerprints and grime.

**How to clean:**
*   Use a soft, damp cloth with a mild cleaner to wipe down the exterior surfaces.
*   For the control panel, dampen a cloth and wring it out well. You do not want water dripping into the electronics.
*   Wipe gently. Do not spray cleaner directly onto the panel.
*   Dry with a clean, soft cloth.

By regularly performing these manual cleaning steps, you supplement the automated clean cycle. This ensures your Kenmore top load washer stays clean, fresh, and fully functional. These small efforts prevent big headaches.

## Troubleshooting Common Clean Cycle Issues

Even with a dedicated clean cycle, you might encounter issues with your Kenmore top load washer. It is normal for appliances to have quirks. Knowing how to troubleshoot helps you solve problems quickly. It gets your washer back to peak performance. I have helped many friends identify these common snags.

### Odor Persists After Clean Cycle

Sometimes, a single clean cycle might not fully eliminate stubborn odors. This is usually due to heavy buildup.

**Possible Solutions:**
*   **Run the cycle again:** A second or even third clean cycle might be necessary. Use the same cleaning agent or try a different one (e.g., if you used Affresh, try bleach next, but never mix them directly).
*   **Increase cleaning agent strength (cautiously):** If using bleach, ensure you used the full recommended 1 cup. For vinegar, try 3-4 cups instead of 2. For severe issues, you might need a professional deep clean.
*   **Manual Cleaning:** Focus on manual cleaning of the dispenser, tub rim, and agitator. Residue in these visible areas can reintroduce odors.
*   **Leave Lid Open:** After every wash and clean cycle, leave the washer lid open for several hours. This allows the drum to air dry completely. This prevents moisture buildup, which is a breeding ground for mold and mildew. This is a crucial step to avoid the problem addressed in articles like [how to clean washer smell](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-smell).
*   **Check Drain Filter (if applicable):** Some models have a drain filter or pump filter that can collect lint and debris. A clogged filter can harbor odors. Consult your manual for its location and cleaning instructions.

### Clean Cycle Won't Start or Complete

If the cycle does not initiate or stops mid-way, check these common points.

**Possible Solutions:**
*   **Lid Not Closed Properly:** Most washers will not start if the lid is not securely closed. Ensure it clicks into place. The lid switch must be engaged.
*   **Power Supply:** Check if the washer is plugged in correctly. Ensure the circuit breaker has not tripped.
*   **Error Code:** Your Kenmore washer might display an error code. Look up the code in your user manual. This code provides specific information about the problem.
*   **Water Supply:** Ensure both hot and cold water faucets are fully open. The washer needs sufficient water pressure to operate.
*   **Overload Sensor:** Though it's a clean cycle, some systems might detect an issue if any residue is blocking a sensor. Ensure the drum is truly empty.
*   **Call Service:** If none of these solutions work, there might be a mechanical or electrical issue. It is time to contact Kenmore customer service or a qualified appliance technician.

### Excessive Foaming During Cycle

Too much suds during the clean cycle indicates excess detergent residue.

**Possible Solutions:**
*   **Reduce Detergent Use:** You might be using too much detergent in your regular washes. This is a common issue. Try reducing the amount you use for your laundry loads.
*   **Run an Extra Rinse:** After the clean cycle, run an empty "Rinse & Spin" cycle. This helps flush out any lingering suds.
*   **Use HE Detergent:** If you have an HE (High-Efficiency) Kenmore washer, always use HE detergent. Regular detergent creates too many suds in HE machines.

Troubleshooting helps you understand your Kenmore top load washer better. Most issues have simple fixes. Addressing problems promptly keeps your machine working well. It also extends its lifespan.

## Maintaining Your Kenmore Top Load Washer for Lasting Cleanliness

Keeping your Kenmore top load washer consistently clean goes beyond just running the clean cycle. It involves adopting several good habits. These practices prevent buildup and odors in the first place. I always emphasize preventive care; it saves time and effort in the long run.

### Frequency of Clean Washer Cycle

Consistency is key. How often should you run the clean washer cycle?

*   **Monthly:** For most households, running the "Clean Washer" cycle once a month is ideal. This routine helps prevent significant buildup.
*   **More Often (Every 2-3 Weeks):** If you wash frequently, live in a hard water area, or primarily use cold water, consider running the cycle every 2-3 weeks. Hard water can leave mineral deposits. Cold water does not dissolve detergent as effectively.
*   **When Odors Appear:** If you notice a musty smell, run the cycle immediately. Do not wait for your scheduled time.

### Proper Detergent and Fabric Softener Use

Overuse of laundry products is a major cause of residue and odors.

*   **Measure Correctly:** Always measure your detergent and fabric softener. Do not just eyeball it. Using too much creates excess suds and residue. This residue builds up inside the washer.
*   **Use HE Detergent for HE Washers:** If your Kenmore top load washer is a High-Efficiency model, use only HE detergent. HE detergents are low-sudsing and designed for less water. Non-HE detergents produce too many suds, which can cause issues and leave more residue.
*   **Avoid Overdosing:** More detergent does not mean cleaner clothes. It often means more residue left behind in your machine and on your garments.

### Leaving the Washer Lid Open

This simple habit is incredibly effective for preventing odors.

*   **Air Dry:** After every wash cycle, leave the washer lid open for several hours. This allows air to circulate inside the drum. It helps dry out any remaining moisture.
*   **Prevent Mildew:** Moisture trapped inside a closed washer creates a damp, dark environment. This is perfect for mold and mildew growth. Airing it out prevents these odor-causing organisms. This also helps with issues found in articles such as [how to clean a Whirlpool washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-whirlpool-washer), as similar principles apply across brands.

### Wiping Down After Each Use

A quick wipe can go a long way.

*   **Tub Rim and Dispenser:** After your final load of laundry for the day, quickly wipe down the washer's top rim and inside the detergent dispenser. Use a dry cloth or a cloth dampened with plain water. This removes fresh residue before it hardens.
*   **Exterior:** Wipe down the exterior of the washer to remove any spills or splashes.

### Dealing with Hard Water

Hard water contains high levels of minerals. These minerals can leave deposits inside your washer.

*   **Water Softener:** Consider using a water softener for your home.
*   **Vinegar Regularly:** If you have hard water, regular use of white vinegar in your clean cycle, or even an occasional empty cycle with vinegar, can help dissolve mineral buildup.

By integrating these maintenance tips into your laundry routine, you ensure your Kenmore top load washer remains clean, fresh, and performs optimally for years to come. A little preventive care goes a long way in keeping your appliance healthy.

## FAQ Section

### Q1: Can I use regular laundry detergent for the clean washer cycle?

No, do not use regular laundry detergent for the clean washer cycle. Laundry detergent cleans clothes. It is not designed to clean the machine itself. It can leave more residue inside the washer. Use a dedicated washer cleaner tablet, liquid chlorine bleach, or white vinegar as recommended for the clean cycle.

### Q2: How often should I run the clean washer cycle on my Kenmore top load?

You should run the clean washer cycle on your Kenmore top load washing machine at least once a month. If you do laundry frequently, live in a hard water area, or use mostly cold water, consider running it every 2-3 weeks to prevent buildup and odors.

### Q3: What if my Kenmore washer does not have a "Clean Washer" cycle button?

If your Kenmore washer lacks a specific "Clean Washer" button, select the "Hot" water temperature setting and the "Deep Water Wash" or "Bulky Items" cycle. These cycles use more hot water and longer agitation. They can mimic the cleaning action of a dedicated cycle. Remember to add a cleaning agent like bleach or vinegar.

### Q4: Can I use both bleach and vinegar in the same clean washer cycle?

No, you must never mix bleach and vinegar in the same clean washer cycle. Mixing bleach and vinegar creates dangerous chlorine gas. This gas is toxic and can cause serious respiratory problems. Choose only one cleaning agent per cycle and ensure the washer is thoroughly rinsed before using a different one.

### Q5: Why does my washer still smell after running the clean cycle?

If your washer still smells after a clean cycle, the odor source might be stubborn buildup or external areas. Run the cycle again. Manually clean the detergent dispenser, tub rim, and agitator base thoroughly. Also, leave the washer lid open after every use to allow the drum to air dry completely and prevent moisture buildup, which fosters mildew.

### Q6: How does hard water affect my Kenmore washer and its cleaning?

Hard water contains minerals that can leave deposits inside your Kenmore washer over time. These mineral deposits can reduce cleaning efficiency. They can also contribute to odors. Using white vinegar in your clean cycle helps break down these mineral deposits. Regular cleaning becomes even more critical with hard water.
