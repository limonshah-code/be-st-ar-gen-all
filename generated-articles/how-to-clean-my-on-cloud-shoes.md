## Cleaning Your On Cloud Shoes: A Simple Guide

Your On Cloud shoes are more than just footwear; they are a key part of your active life. They help you run, walk, and move comfortably. Over time, dirt and grime collect on them. Cleaning your On Cloud shoes properly keeps them looking good and extends their life. This guide shows you how to clean your On Cloud shoes safely and effectively. We will cover necessary tools, step-by-step cleaning methods, and tips for special situations. You will learn how to make your favorite sneakers shine again.

### Takeaway

*   Gather the right, gentle cleaning tools before you start.
*   Always hand wash your On Cloud shoes to protect materials.
*   Target specific stains with care, using gentle solutions.
*   Air dry your shoes completely, away from direct heat.

**How to clean your On Cloud shoes:** To clean On Cloud shoes, remove laces and insoles first. Brush off loose dirt. Hand wash the upper with a mild soap solution and a soft brush or cloth. Clean the CloudTec soles carefully to remove debris. Rinse with cool water and air dry away from heat or direct sunlight.

## Understanding Your On Cloud Shoes: Materials and Design

On Cloud shoes feature unique designs and materials. They often use lightweight mesh, synthetic fabrics, and their signature CloudTec soles. These materials make the shoes comfortable and perform well. However, they also need specific care when cleaning. The mesh uppers can trap dirt easily, and the CloudTec pods can collect small stones or mud. Understanding these parts helps you clean them better. It ensures you maintain the shoe's structure and appearance without causing damage.

Many On Cloud models, like the Cloudstratus or Cloudflow, use very breathable, thin mesh. This mesh is light, but it can be delicate. Strong scrubbing or harsh chemicals can fray the fibers or cause discoloration. The rubber CloudTec elements are durable but need attention to remove trapped debris. Inside, many On Cloud shoes have comfortable foam insoles and fabric linings. These parts absorb sweat and can develop odors. Knowing these details helps you choose the right cleaning method. It helps you keep your On Cloud shoes in excellent condition.

### Delicate Mesh Uppers

The mesh on On Cloud shoes offers great ventilation. This material is not as durable as leather or thick canvas. You must use soft brushes and mild cleaners on it. Harsh scrubbing can damage the mesh threads. Strong chemicals can also break down the fabric's integrity. Always test your cleaning solution on a small, hidden area first. This prevents any unwanted reactions.

### Unique CloudTec Soles

On's CloudTec sole is a key feature, providing responsive cushioning. The hollow "clouds" compress as you run or walk. However, small stones, dirt, and mud can get stuck in these gaps. It is important to remove this debris before washing. If you leave debris, it can scratch the sole or stay there even after cleaning. A small brush or toothpick works well for this task.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Tools: What You Need

Before you start cleaning your On Cloud shoes, gather all necessary supplies. Having everything ready makes the process smooth and efficient. You do not need many special tools. Most items are common household products. Using the right tools protects your shoes from damage. It also ensures a thorough clean.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Soft-bristled brush:** An old toothbrush or a soft shoe brush works well. This is for gentle scrubbing on the upper.
*   **Mild soap or detergent:** Choose a gentle laundry detergent, dish soap, or a dedicated shoe cleaner. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach.
*   **Two small bowls or buckets:** One for clean water, one for your soapy solution.
*   **Clean cloths or sponges:** Microfiber cloths are good for wiping.
*   **Old towel:** To protect your work surface and to absorb excess water.
*   **Paper towels or old newspapers:** For stuffing the shoes to help them dry.
*   **Toothpick or small blunt tool:** For removing debris from the CloudTec soles.
*   **Shoe deodorizer (optional):** For keeping the inside fresh.

When selecting your soap, always choose a mild option. Harsh cleaners can strip colors or damage the shoe's fabric. For example, [cleaning white shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes) requires extra care to avoid yellowing. A diluted solution of mild dish soap often works perfectly for most On Cloud materials. Make sure your brushes are truly soft. Stiff bristles can abrade the mesh or scratch synthetic overlays. Having all these items ready prevents interruptions and makes the cleaning job easier.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning On Cloud Shoes

Cleaning your On Cloud shoes does not have to be difficult. Follow these steps for a complete and safe cleaning process. This method protects the unique materials of your shoes. It helps them look new again. Remember, patience and gentle actions are key to success. This guide focuses on hand cleaning, which is the safest method for most On Cloud models.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Shoes

First, remove the laces and insoles from your On Cloud shoes. This allows you to clean each part separately. It also helps the shoes dry faster. Place the laces and insoles aside. You will clean them later.

### Step 2: Remove Loose Dirt and Debris

Take your shoes outside or over a trash can. Gently tap the soles together to dislodge loose dirt and mud. Use a soft-bristled brush or an old toothbrush to brush off any remaining dry dirt from the uppers and soles. Pay special attention to the CloudTec pods. Use a toothpick or small, blunt tool to carefully remove any stones, twigs, or mud stuck in the gaps of the sole. This step prevents dirt from spreading during washing. It also protects the unique sole design.

### Step 3: Clean the Uppers

Prepare a cleaning solution. Mix a small amount of mild soap or detergent with warm water in a bowl. Dip your soft-bristled brush or a clean cloth into the soapy water. Gently scrub the mesh and synthetic parts of the shoe's upper. Use light, circular motions. Do not press too hard. Focus on dirty spots. For specific issues like [cleaning stained shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stained-shoes), you may need a slightly more concentrated solution. Wipe away excess foam with a clean, damp cloth. Repeat until the upper looks clean.

### Step 4: Clean the Soles and Midsoles

The soles of your On Cloud shoes can get very dirty. Use your soft-bristled brush and the soapy solution to clean the sides of the midsoles and the bottom outsoles. Scrub firmly but not aggressively. Make sure to get into all the grooves of the CloudTec. Rinse the brush often in clean water. Wipe the cleaned areas with a damp cloth. You want to remove all soap residue. This brings back the clean appearance of the rubber.

### Step 5: Clean the Laces and Insoles

For the laces, you can put them in a mesh laundry bag and wash them in your washing machine on a gentle cycle. Or, hand wash them in the same soapy water used for the shoes. Rub them between your hands. Rinse them thoroughly. For insoles, gently scrub them with the soapy solution. Pay attention to areas where dirt or sweat accumulates. Rinse them well. Ensure all soap is gone. This helps prevent future odors inside your shoes. Knowing [how to clean the inside of shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes) is key for overall freshness.

### Step 6: Rinse Your Shoes

After cleaning all parts, rinse your On Cloud shoes under cool, running water. You can also use a clean, damp cloth to wipe down all surfaces. Make sure to remove all soap residue from the uppers and soles. Leftover soap can attract more dirt or leave marks when dry. Be thorough but avoid soaking the shoes completely.

## Tackling Tough Stains on On Cloud Shoes

Sometimes, regular cleaning is not enough for stubborn stains. On Cloud shoes, especially white or light-colored ones, can show dirt easily. Different types of stains need different approaches. Always act quickly when a stain occurs. This increases your chances of complete removal. Remember to be gentle with On Cloud materials.

### Mud Stains

Let mud dry completely on your On Cloud shoes. Do not try to wipe wet mud. Once dry, gently brush off as much as you can. Use a soft brush or an old toothbrush. Then, follow the general cleaning steps with mild soap and water. If a faint stain remains, try a small amount of hydrogen peroxide diluted in water. Apply it with a cotton swab and gently blot. Rinse well afterwards.

### Oil or Grease Stains

Oil stains require immediate action. Blot the stain with a paper towel to absorb excess oil. Do not rub. Sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder over the stain. Let it sit for several hours or overnight. The powder absorbs the oil. Brush off the powder. Then, apply a small amount of dish soap directly to the stain. Gently rub with a soft cloth or brush. Rinse thoroughly. You might need to repeat this process for old stains.

### Grass Stains

Grass stains can be tough on athletic shoes like On Clouds. A common household item for grass stains is rubbing alcohol. Dampen a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol. Gently dab the stained area. Do not rub, as this can spread the stain. Follow with a normal soap and water clean. For stubborn green marks, a paste of baking soda and a few drops of water can help. Apply the paste, let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then scrub gently and rinse. This method works well for [cleaning canvas shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-canvas-shoes) which often get grass stains.

### Blood Stains

For fresh blood stains, rinse immediately with cold water. Cold water prevents the blood from setting. For dried blood, mix a small amount of hydrogen peroxide with cold water. Apply it to the stain with a cloth or cotton swab. Let it fizz for a moment. Blot the area. Rinse with cool water. Be careful with hydrogen peroxide on colored fabrics; test it in an inconspicuous spot first. Repeat if necessary.

## Cleaning the Inside of Your On Cloud Shoes

The inside of your On Cloud shoes can become just as dirty as the outside. Foot sweat, bacteria, and dead skin cells accumulate there. This can lead to unpleasant odors. Cleaning the inside is important for hygiene and comfort. It also helps extend the life of your shoes. This step is often overlooked but crucial for a complete refresh.

### Step 1: Remove Insoles and Laces

As mentioned before, remove the insoles and laces. They are often the main source of odor and dirt. Clean them separately as instructed in the main cleaning guide. This allows you to reach all interior surfaces.

### Step 2: Address Odor

For persistent odors, a simple deodorizing spray helps. You can also sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes. Let it sit overnight. Baking soda absorbs odors. In the morning, shake out the powder. For strong smells, a solution of vinegar and water can be effective. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Spray a light mist inside the shoes. Let it air dry completely. Vinegar neutralizes odors. This method is effective when [cleaning smelly shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes).

### Step 3: Clean the Interior Fabric

Use a damp cloth dipped in a mild soap solution. Gently wipe down the entire interior fabric lining. Pay attention to the heel and toe areas. These spots gather the most sweat and dirt. Do not over-saturate the fabric. Too much water can make drying difficult and encourage mildew. After wiping, use a clean, damp cloth to remove any soap residue.

### Step 4: Air Dry Thoroughly

After cleaning the inside, ensure the shoes dry completely. Place them in a well-ventilated area. You can stuff them with paper towels or crumpled newspaper. These materials absorb moisture and help maintain the shoe's shape. Replace the paper regularly until the shoes are dry. Never use heat, as it can damage the materials. A thorough drying prevents mold and mildew growth. This makes your On Cloud shoes feel fresh and comfortable for your next run or walk.

## Machine Washing On Cloud Shoes: When and How

While hand washing is generally the safest method for On Cloud shoes, some people consider machine washing. This method carries risks. The delicate mesh, glue bonds, and unique sole structure can be damaged by the machine's agitation. However, if you choose to machine wash, follow specific precautions. This section guides you on when to consider it and how to do it safely.

### When to Consider Machine Washing

Machine washing is an option for On Cloud shoes that are very dirty or heavily soiled, where hand washing might not be enough. It is more suitable for models with primarily synthetic or mesh uppers. Avoid machine washing if your shoes have leather components, delicate embellishments, or show any signs of existing damage. Remember, machine washing can shorten the lifespan of your shoes. It is a riskier alternative to hand cleaning. The official On Running website typically recommends against machine washing for their shoes. However, many people still choose to use a washer for [how to clean shoes in the washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer).

### How to Machine Wash Safely

If you decide to machine wash your On Cloud shoes, follow these steps to minimize potential damage:

1.  **Preparation is Key:** First, remove laces and insoles from your shoes. Brush off all loose dirt, mud, and debris from the uppers and soles. Use a toothpick to clear out the CloudTec elements. Place the shoes, laces, and insoles in separate mesh laundry bags. This protects them from getting tangled or damaged by the machine's drum.
2.  **Use Cold Water:** Set your washing machine to a cold water, gentle, or delicate cycle. Hot water can break down glues and materials. A gentle cycle reduces stress on the shoe's structure. Avoid using any heavy wash settings.
3.  **Choose a Mild Detergent:** Add a small amount of mild liquid laundry detergent. Do not use harsh powdered detergents, bleach, or fabric softeners. These can harm the shoe materials or leave residue.
4.  **Add Towels:** Place a few old towels in the washing machine with your shoes. The towels provide cushioning. They help absorb some of the impact and prevent the shoes from banging against the machine drum. This also balances the load.
5.  **No Spin Cycle:** If your machine allows, disable the spin cycle. The high-speed spinning can be very damaging to shoe structure. If you cannot disable it, choose the lowest spin setting. You want to avoid any twisting or high-force movements.
6.  **Air Dry Immediately:** As soon as the cycle finishes, remove your shoes from the washer. Do not put them in a dryer. Tumble drying with heat will shrink, warp, and damage your On Cloud shoes. Air dry them completely, following the drying instructions below.

Machine washing is a last resort. Always prioritize hand cleaning for the best longevity and care of your On Cloud shoes.

## Drying and Maintaining Your On Cloud Shoes

Proper drying is as important as the cleaning itself. Incorrect drying can lead to damage, odor, or misshapen shoes. After cleaning your On Cloud shoes, follow these steps for effective and safe drying. Once dry, ongoing maintenance helps keep them fresh between washes. This extends their life and keeps them ready for your next adventure.

### Drying Your On Cloud Shoes

1.  **Never Use Heat:** The most critical rule for drying On Cloud shoes is to avoid heat. This means no tumble dryers, no direct sunlight, and no heat vents or radiators. High heat can melt glues, shrink materials, or warp the CloudTec soles. It can permanently damage your shoes.
2.  **Air Dry in a Ventilated Area:** Place your cleaned shoes in a well-ventilated room. A shaded outdoor area on a warm, breezy day works well too. Open windows or a fan can speed up drying.
3.  **Stuff with Paper Towels or Newspaper:** Lightly stuff the inside of your shoes with clean paper towels or crumpled newspaper. This helps absorb moisture from within. It also helps the shoes keep their shape as they dry. Change the paper every few hours, or when it feels damp.
4.  **Position for Airflow:** Position the shoes so air can circulate around them. You can stand them upright or lean them against a wall. If possible, elevate them slightly. This ensures all parts, including the soles, can dry evenly.
5.  **Allow Ample Time:** Drying can take 24 to 48 hours, depending on humidity and how wet the shoes got. Do not rush the process. Make sure they are completely dry before wearing them again or putting them away. Wearing damp shoes causes odors and can lead to mildew.

### Maintaining Your On Cloud Shoes

Maintaining your On Cloud shoes between cleanings helps keep them looking good. It also reduces how often you need a full wash.

*   **Brush Off Loose Dirt Regularly:** After each run or walk, quickly brush off any loose dirt or mud from the uppers and soles. This prevents dirt from setting into the fabric.
*   **Wipe Down with a Damp Cloth:** If your shoes get minor marks, wipe them down with a damp cloth immediately. This prevents small stains from becoming permanent.
*   **Store Properly:** Store your On Cloud shoes in a cool, dry place. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or damp areas. Stuffing them with shoe trees or paper when not in use helps them keep their shape.
*   **Use Shoe Deodorizer:** If your shoes develop an odor, use a shoe deodorizer spray or sprinkle baking soda inside. This keeps them fresh.
*   **Rotate Your Shoes:** If you have multiple pairs of On Cloud shoes, rotate them. This gives each pair time to fully air out and dry between wears. It extends the life of each pair.

By following these drying and maintenance tips, your On Cloud shoes will stay in better condition for longer. This ensures they continue to support your active lifestyle.

### How do I remove smells from the inside of my On Cloud shoes?
To remove smells, first take out the insoles and clean them. Then, sprinkle baking soda generously inside the shoes and let it sit overnight. Baking soda absorbs odors. Alternatively, use a deodorizing spray designed for shoes. Ensure shoes are fully dry after any cleaning to prevent new odors.

### Is it safe to use a washing machine for my On Cloud shoes?
