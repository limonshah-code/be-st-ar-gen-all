## How To Clean Shoes In The Washer For Best Results

Have you ever looked at your favorite pair of sneakers and wished they could look new again? Many people wonder if their dirty shoes can safely go into the washing machine. I used to think hand-washing was the only way. The good news is that cleaning shoes in the washer is possible and often very effective. This method saves time and effort, making your footwear fresh and clean.

This comprehensive guide will show you exactly how to clean shoes in the washer without damage. We will cover which shoes are safe to wash and how to prepare them. You will learn the best washing settings and proper drying methods. By following these steps, you can refresh your shoes and keep them looking great for longer.

### Takeaway

*   **Assess Shoe Material:** Only wash athletic shoes, canvas, and most synthetic fabrics. Avoid leather, suede, and delicate materials.
*   **Pre-Clean Thoroughly:** Remove laces, insoles, and loose dirt before washing.
*   **Use Mesh Bags:** Protect shoes and your washing machine by placing them in mesh laundry bags.
*   **Wash with Towels:** Add old towels to balance the load and reduce noise.
*   **Use Cold Water & Gentle Cycle:** Prevents shrinking, fading, and damage.
*   **Air Dry Completely:** Never put shoes in the dryer; air dry in a well-ventilated area.

To clean shoes in the washer, you must first remove excess dirt and laces, then place them in a mesh laundry bag. Wash them with a few towels on a cold, gentle cycle using mild detergent. Always air dry shoes away from direct heat to prevent damage.

### Identifying Washable Shoe Materials

Not all shoes can go into a washing machine. Putting the wrong type of shoe in the washer can cause irreversible damage. I learned this the hard way with a favorite pair of leather boots. Knowing which materials are safe is the first important step. This knowledge protects your shoes and your washing machine.

Athletic shoes, like sneakers made from canvas, nylon, or synthetic mesh, are generally safe. These materials hold up well to water and mild agitation. Most running shoes and canvas casual shoes fall into this category. Always check the care label inside your shoe if one exists.

Shoes made from leather, suede, silk, or satin are not suitable for machine washing. Water can stain leather and suede, causing them to crack or stiffen. Delicates like silk can easily get damaged or lose their shape. Shoes with delicate embellishments, sequins, or intricate beading should also be hand-cleaned. If you have white shoes that need special attention, consider [how to clean white shoes with hydrogen peroxide](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes-with-hydrogen-peroxide) for targeted stain removal.

### Essential Pre-Wash Preparations

Proper preparation is key to a successful shoe wash. Skipping these steps can leave your shoes still dirty or even damage them. I always make sure to prepare my shoes carefully before they go into the machine. This effort ensures the best possible outcome.

First, remove the laces from your shoes. Laces can get tangled around the agitator or other parts of the washing machine. They also tend to clean better when washed separately. You can hand wash them with a brush or place them in a small mesh bag with the shoes.

Next, take out the insoles if they are removable. Insoles often absorb a lot of foot odor and moisture. They can also degrade faster in the washing machine than the shoe itself. It is usually better to hand wash them separately or wipe them down.

Finally, remove any large chunks of dirt, mud, or debris from the shoes. Use a dry brush or an old toothbrush to scrub off loose dirt from the soles and uppers. This step prevents dirt from clogging your washing machine's drain or redepositing onto the shoes. It makes the washing machine's job much easier.

### Protecting Your Shoes and Washer

Protecting both your shoes and your washing machine is crucial. Shoes can bang around inside the drum, causing noise and potential damage. This can also harm the washing machine itself. Using the right protective measures ensures a safe and effective wash.

Place your shoes inside a mesh laundry bag. These bags prevent shoes from tumbling freely and hitting the drum walls. They also keep the laces or any small parts contained. A sturdy bag designed for delicates or shoes works best. I use one large enough to fit both shoes comfortably.

Add a few old towels to the washing machine along with your bagged shoes. The towels provide cushioning and help balance the load. This reduces the banging noise and lessens the impact on the washer's internal components. Choose towels that you do not mind getting dirty or that are already well-worn.

For added protection, especially with front-loading machines, you can use a zippered pillowcase if you do not have a mesh bag. Make sure the pillowcase is tightly closed. This simple step goes a long way in preventing wear and tear on both your footwear and appliance.

### Choosing the Right Detergent and Water Temperature

Selecting the correct detergent and water temperature is vital for cleaning shoes effectively. Using the wrong products or settings can fade colors, shrink materials, or even damage the shoe structure. I always pay close attention to these details for the best results. This careful approach helps preserve the shoes.

Use a mild liquid laundry detergent for washing shoes. Heavy-duty powder detergents can be too harsh or leave residue. Avoid using bleach, even on white shoes, as it can weaken materials over time. A small amount, about half the usual recommendation for a small load, is typically sufficient. For tough stains, you can pre-treat spots with a gentle stain remover or a mix of [vinegar and baking soda](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-with-vinegar-and-baking-soda).

Always use cold water for washing shoes. Cold water prevents colors from bleeding and materials from shrinking or warping. Hot water can cause adhesives to melt, leading to shoes falling apart. It can also set stains rather than remove them. Cold water is generally safer for synthetic materials and fabrics.

Opt for the gentle or delicate cycle on your washing machine. This setting uses less agitation and a slower spin speed. It minimizes stress on the shoe materials and stitching. A harsh cycle could cause significant damage. Some machines have a "hand wash" or "bulky items" setting which might also work well.

### The Washing Process: Step-by-Step

Washing shoes in the machine is a straightforward process once you know the steps. Following these instructions ensures a thorough clean without damaging your beloved footwear. I have used this method many times, and it consistently delivers good results. This systematic approach is easy to follow.

First, load your prepared shoes into the washing machine. Place the mesh bag containing your shoes inside the drum. Then, add 2-3 old towels around the shoes. This helps to cushion the shoes and balance the load, reducing loud thumping noises during the wash cycle.

Next, add your mild liquid detergent. As mentioned, use about half the amount you would for a regular load of laundry. Avoid fabric softener, as it can leave a residue on the shoe materials. Close the detergent dispenser.

Select the cold water setting and the delicate or gentle cycle. Ensure the spin speed is set to low. A high spin speed can be too harsh on shoes and can cause them to become misshapen. Start the washing machine and let it complete the cycle. Many people successfully clean their [sneakers in the washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-sneakers-in-the-washing-machine) using these exact steps.

### Drying Your Shoes Safely

Drying shoes correctly after washing is just as important as the wash itself. Improper drying can ruin your shoes, causing them to shrink, crack, or warp. I always make sure to air dry my shoes thoroughly and patiently. This step requires time but protects your footwear.

Never put your shoes in the dryer. The high heat of a clothes dryer is the biggest enemy of most shoe materials. Heat can melt adhesives, cause rubber soles to crack, and shrink fabric or synthetic uppers. It can also cause plastic components to deform. This damage is usually irreversible.

After the wash cycle finishes, remove the shoes and towels from the machine. Gently blot any excess water from the shoes with a clean towel. Reshape the shoes if necessary, especially the toe area. You can stuff them lightly with paper towels or newspaper to help absorb moisture and maintain their shape. Change the paper every few hours.

Air dry your shoes in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight or heat sources. A cool, dry place is ideal. You can place them outdoors on a sunny day if the air is not too humid. If drying indoors, place them near an open window or a fan. It can take 24-48 hours for shoes to dry completely, depending on the material and humidity. Ensure they are completely dry before wearing them to prevent mildew or odor.

### Post-Wash Care and Maintenance

After your shoes are clean and dry, a few final steps can help them look their best and last longer. This post-wash care ensures your efforts pay off. I take these extra measures to keep my shoes in top condition. These actions make a noticeable difference.

Once completely dry, put the insoles back into your shoes. If you hand-washed the laces, re-lace your shoes. Fresh laces can make the shoes look even cleaner. Consider replacing old, worn-out laces with new ones for an instant refresh.

You might want to apply a fabric protector spray, especially if your shoes are made of canvas or mesh. These sprays help repel water and stains, keeping your shoes cleaner for longer. Always follow the product instructions carefully. This adds an extra layer of defense against future dirt.

Store your clean shoes in a cool, dry place. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or damp areas. Proper storage helps maintain their shape and prevents mildew or unpleasant odors. Regular maintenance, like brushing off loose dirt after each wear, can reduce how often you need a full wash. This keeps your shoes looking good and extends their life.

### FAQ Section

#### Can all types of shoes be washed in a washing machine?
No, not all shoes are suitable for machine washing. Athletic shoes, canvas, and synthetic materials are generally safe. Avoid washing leather, suede, silk, delicate shoes, or those with elaborate embellishments. Always check the shoe’s care label if available.

#### What kind of detergent should I use for washing shoes?
You should use a mild liquid laundry detergent. Avoid harsh powders, fabric softeners, or bleach. A small amount, usually half of what you would use for a regular laundry load, is sufficient. This helps protect the shoe materials from damage.

#### Should I use hot or cold water for washing shoes?

No, you should never put shoes in a clothes dryer. The high heat can cause permanent damage, including melting adhesives, shrinking materials, cracking soles, or deforming plastic components. Always air dry your shoes in a well-ventilated area.

#### How long does it take for shoes to air dry completely?
Air drying time varies depending on the shoe material, humidity, and airflow. Generally, it can take 24 to 48 hours for shoes to dry completely. Ensure they are fully dry before wearing them to prevent odors or mildew growth.
