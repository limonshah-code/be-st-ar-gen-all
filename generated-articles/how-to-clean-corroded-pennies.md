## Bring Back the Shine: Cleaning Corroded Pennies Safely

Have you ever found an old penny, dark with grime and corrosion, and wondered if its original shine could return? Many people discover old coins in jars, forgotten purses, or even dug up from the garden. These coins often show significant signs of corrosion, turning green, black, or brown. Knowing how to clean corroded pennies can transform these seemingly worthless discs into interesting pieces, or at least make them recognizable. This article provides a straightforward guide to safely clean corroded pennies, covering common methods, essential supplies, and crucial warnings. We will explore different types of corrosion and specific approaches for copper and steel pennies. You will learn to remove rust and verdigris without causing further harm, ensuring your pennies look their best.

**Takeaway:**
*   Identify the type of penny and its corrosion before cleaning.
*   Use gentle, non-abrasive methods to preserve coin details.
*   Always test cleaning solutions on a less valuable coin first.
*   Dry pennies completely after cleaning to prevent new corrosion.

You can clean corroded pennies using common household items like vinegar, salt, and baking soda. These agents react with the corrosion, helping to dissolve it without harsh scrubbing. Always proceed with caution to avoid damaging the coin's surface.

### Understanding Penny Corrosion: Why They Turn Green or Brown

Pennies corrode for simple reasons. The metal reacts with elements in the air and environment. Copper pennies, for example, contain mostly copper. This copper reacts with oxygen and moisture. This reaction forms copper oxides and carbonates. You see these as green or brown stains.

Steel pennies, like those from 1943, rust. Steel is iron with carbon. When iron touches water and oxygen, rust forms. Rust is iron oxide. It appears as reddish-brown flakes. Different metals corrode differently, so the cleaning method depends on the penny's composition.

Understanding the type of corrosion helps you choose the right cleaning method. Green buildup often means copper carbonate, also known as verdigris. Black or dark brown layers typically indicate copper sulfide or thick oxidation. Reddish-brown spots on steel pennies are plain rust. Each type requires a specific approach for effective removal. Proper identification ensures you do not worsen the coin's condition while trying to clean it. This knowledge prepares you for successful penny restoration.

### Gathering Your Supplies: Essential Tools for Cleaning Pennies

Before you start cleaning, gather your supplies. Having everything ready makes the process smooth and efficient. You will need a few simple items, most of which you probably already own. Start with a non-abrasive container. A small glass bowl or plastic cup works well. Avoid using metal containers, as they can react with cleaning solutions.

You will also need a soft cloth. Microfiber towels or old cotton shirts are perfect. These materials will not scratch the penny's surface. A soft-bristle brush, like an old toothbrush, can help gently scrub away loosened corrosion. However, use brushes with extreme care to avoid scratching. For your cleaning agents, common choices include white vinegar, baking soda, and distilled water. Some people also use lemon juice or even ketchup, which contains mild acids.

Safety gear is important too. Wear gloves to protect your hands from mild acids or cleaners. Eye protection is also a good idea. Prepare a clean drying surface, like another soft towel or paper towels. Remember, proper preparation prevents issues. Gather your tools before you begin to ensure a safe and effective cleaning experience. This careful preparation is key to restoring your [corroded coins](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-corroded-coins) without damage.

### Safe Cleaning Methods for Copper Pennies: Gentle Approaches

Cleaning copper pennies requires a gentle touch. Copper is a soft metal. Harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbing can easily scratch or damage the coin's details. The goal is to remove corrosion without devaluing the penny. For common green or brown corrosion, a vinegar and salt solution is very effective. Mix a quarter cup of white vinegar with a teaspoon of table salt in a glass bowl. Stir until the salt dissolves.

Place your corroded copper pennies into this solution. Let them soak for a few minutes. You might see the solution changing color as it works. For heavily corroded pennies, extend the soaking time. Check the pennies every few minutes to monitor progress. Once the corrosion loosens, remove the pennies. Gently rub them with your fingers or a soft cloth. You can also use a soft-bristle toothbrush for stubborn spots, but be very gentle.

Another effective method involves lemon juice and salt. This combination works similarly to vinegar, providing a mild acid reaction. Afterward, rinse the pennies thoroughly with distilled water. This step is crucial to stop the chemical reaction. Failure to rinse properly can cause new corrosion. Then, pat them dry completely with a soft cloth. Remember, patience and gentleness are key when [cleaning copper pennies without damaging them](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-copper-pennies-without-damaging-them). For more advanced cleaning options, you can also explore how to [clean green pennies](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-green-pennies) specifically.

### Cleaning Steel Pennies: Special Considerations for 1943 Coins

Cleaning steel pennies, especially the unique 1943 steel pennies, requires a different approach. These coins are made of steel, which rusts easily. Unlike copper, steel pennies can be damaged by acidic solutions like vinegar if left for too long. Rust on steel pennies appears as a reddish-brown discoloration. The goal is to remove this rust without corroding the zinc coating.

For lightly rusted steel pennies, a simple olive oil soak can work wonders. Place the pennies in a small dish and cover them with olive oil. Let them soak for several days, or even weeks, for the best results. The oil will slowly loosen the rust. Afterward, gently wipe the pennies with a soft cloth. You can also use a wooden toothpick to dislodge any remaining rust. This method is slow but very safe.

For heavier rust, a baking soda paste is a good option. Mix baking soda with a small amount of water to create a thick paste. Apply this paste to the steel penny. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then, gently rub the penny with a soft cloth or your fingers. The baking soda acts as a mild abrasive. Always rinse the penny thoroughly with distilled water and dry it completely. Remember, these coins are delicate. Learning how to [clean 1943 steel pennies](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-1943-steel-pennies) correctly ensures their preservation. This knowledge helps maintain their historical value.

### Dealing with Severe Corrosion: Advanced Techniques for Tough Stains

Some pennies suffer from severe corrosion. These coins might have thick layers of green verdigris or heavy rust. Standard methods may not fully clean them. For these instances, you can try slightly more robust but still cautious techniques. One common method for heavily [corroded pennies that are corroded](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pennies-that-are-corroded) is the electrolysis method. This method uses a small electrical current to reverse the corrosion process. It works best for heavily oxidized or encrusted coins.

However, electrolysis can also be quite aggressive. It removes the corrosion but might also affect the coin's surface. Only use this if other gentle methods have failed completely. You will need a power source, wires, a non-metal container, and an electrolyte solution. A common electrolyte is salt water or baking soda solution. Always research the specific setup and safety precautions for electrolysis before attempting it. This method requires care and understanding.

Another option for stubborn green stains on copper pennies is a longer soak in a milder acidic solution. Instead of just vinegar and salt, consider a very dilute lemon juice solution. You can dilute lemon juice with water to make it less potent. Soak the pennies for longer periods, checking them frequently. Sometimes, multiple short soaks are better than one long one. Always rinse thoroughly afterward. For particularly valuable or old coins, such as [Indian Head pennies](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-indian-head-pennies), consider professional conservation rather than risking damage with aggressive cleaning.

### The Importance of Drying and Storage: Preventing Future Corrosion

After you clean your corroded pennies, proper drying is crucial. Any moisture left on the coin can immediately start new corrosion. Even a tiny bit of water can cause spots or discoloration. The cleaning process removes old protective layers, leaving the metal more vulnerable. Therefore, dry the pennies completely and quickly.

First, rinse the pennies thoroughly under distilled water. Tap water contains minerals that can leave spots. Use clean, soft cloths, like microfiber towels, to gently pat the pennies dry. Do not rub them vigorously, as this can cause micro-scratches. After patting, let the pennies air dry for a few hours. Place them on a dry, absorbent surface, perhaps on a paper towel. Some people use a hairdryer on a cool setting for quicker drying. Ensure they are bone dry before storage.

Proper storage prevents future corrosion. Do not store cleaned pennies in humid environments. Avoid plastic bags or containers that contain PVC (polyvinyl chloride). PVC can degrade over time and release chemicals that harm coins. Instead, use archival-safe coin holders. These are typically made of inert materials like Mylar or polypropylene. Individual coin flips or coin albums designed for collectors are excellent choices. Store these holders in a cool, dry place. Proper drying and storage are your best defense against recurring corrosion.

### What Not to Do: Avoiding Damage to Your Pennies

When cleaning corroded pennies, knowing what to avoid is as important as knowing what to do. Many common cleaning mistakes can cause irreversible damage. Your goal is to restore the penny, not to destroy its historical or aesthetic value. First, never use abrasive materials. Steel wool, sandpaper, or harsh scrubbing pads will scratch the coin's surface. These scratches remove details and can drastically reduce the coin's value. Even rough cloths can leave micro-scratches on soft copper.

Avoid harsh chemical cleaners. Products like bleach, ammonia, or strong acid solutions are too aggressive for coins. They can strip away the natural patina, alter the coin's color, or even etch the metal. This damage is permanent. While some people use these, the risks outweigh the benefits. For example, even if you are [cleaning corroded metal](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-corroded-metal) in general, coins need a more gentle approach.

Never put pennies in a rock tumbler or use rotary tools with abrasive attachments. These machines are designed for polishing, not for gentle coin cleaning. They will quickly erode the coin's design, making it smooth and featureless. Finally, do not clean valuable or rare pennies yourself. If you have an antique penny, or one with significant collector value, consult a professional coin conservator. Amateur cleaning can devalue rare coins by thousands of dollars. Always prioritize preservation. Learning how to [clean old pennies without devaluing them](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-old-pennies-without-devaluing-them) involves extreme caution and sometimes, no cleaning at all.
