### How Much Homemade Dog Food For 70 Lb Dog

A 70 lb dog typically needs 1,000 to 1,800 calories per day. This amount depends on their age, activity level, and metabolism. For homemade food, this often translates to 3 to 6 cups daily, split into two meals. However, exact portions vary greatly. Weighing food and consulting a vet ensures proper nutrition for your 70 lb dog.

## Understanding Your 70 Lb Dog's Nutritional Needs

A 70 lb dog is a large breed. Large dogs have specific nutritional requirements. Their bodies need proper fuel for bone health and energy. Getting the right **homemade dog food for 70 lb dog** prevents health problems. Too little food leads to weight loss and nutrient deficiencies. Too much food causes obesity and joint strain.

Your dog's age impacts their needs. Puppies need more calories for growth. Senior dogs often need fewer calories. Activity level is also a big factor. A highly active dog burns more calories. A couch potato needs less food to maintain a healthy weight.

Metabolism plays a role too. Some dogs burn calories faster. Others have slower metabolisms. Breed also influences energy needs. A Labrador Retriever might have different needs than a German Shepherd, even at the same weight. All these factors shape your 70 lb dog's daily food intake.

We must consider macronutrients. Dogs need protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Protein supports muscle growth and repair. Fats provide concentrated energy and essential fatty acids. Carbohydrates offer quick energy. A balanced diet includes all these elements.

For large breeds, joint health is a concern. Appropriate nutrition helps prevent issues. Overfeeding can stress joints. Homemade food allows you to tailor ingredients. You can add joint-supporting nutrients. This personalized approach is a major benefit of preparing food at home.

Ensuring your 70 lb dog receives the right nutrition is crucial. It supports their overall well-being. This proactive care helps them live a long, healthy life. We will explore how to calculate these needs further.

## Calculating Daily Calories for a 70 Lb Dog

Determining **how much homemade dog food for 70 lb dog** starts with calorie calculation. Every dog has a unique calorie requirement. We use a formula to estimate this. The Resting Energy Requirement (RER) is the base. This is the energy a dog needs at rest.

The RER formula is: 70 x (body weight in kg)^0.75. A 70 lb dog weighs about 31.8 kg. So, the RER is 70 x (31.8)^0.75. This equals approximately 1,114 calories per day. This number is just a starting point.

Next, we calculate the Maintenance Energy Requirement (MER). This considers your dog's activity level. We multiply the RER by a specific factor. The factor changes based on your dog's lifestyle.

Here are common MER multipliers:
*   **Sedentary or Neutered/Spayed Adults:** RER x 1.6 (for neutered) or RER x 1.4 (for intact)
*   **Active Adults:** RER x 2.0 to 5.0 (depending on activity)
*   **Senior Dogs:** RER x 1.2 to 1.4 (often less active)
*   **Weight Loss:** RER x 1.0
*   **Weight Gain:** RER x 1.8 or higher

Let's do an example for an average 70 lb neutered dog. RER is 1,114 calories. We multiply by 1.6 for a neutered dog. So, 1,114 x 1.6 = 1,782.4 calories per day. This is a good estimated daily calorie intake for your **70 lb dog homemade food**.

This number gives you a solid target. However, it is still an estimate. Your dog's actual needs can vary. Factors like genetics, indoor temperature, and stress affect energy use. Always observe your dog's body condition. Adjust food portions as needed.

Regular vet check-ups are important. Your veterinarian can help fine-tune these calculations. They consider your dog's overall health. This ensures your 70 lb dog gets the proper amount of homemade food.

## Portioning Homemade Dog Food: Cups and Weight

After calculating calories, you need to turn that into actual food portions. This is a critical step when determining **how much homemade dog food for 70 lb dog**. Homemade food varies greatly in calorie density. A cup of chicken and rice is different from a cup of lean beef and vegetables. This makes using "cups" alone unreliable.

I always recommend using a kitchen scale. Weighing your dog's food ensures accuracy. It guarantees consistency with calorie goals. For example, if your 70 lb dog needs 1,700 calories per day, and your homemade recipe has 200 calories per 100 grams, you would feed 850 grams daily. This would be split into two meals.

While weighing is best, I understand people want cup estimates. Generally, a 70 lb dog might eat 3 to 6 cups of homemade food daily. This wide range highlights the density issue. A denser food (more meat, less water) means fewer cups. A less dense food (more vegetables, higher water content) means more cups.

To get a better cup estimate, first weigh a typical cup of your specific homemade recipe. Then, divide your total daily grams by the grams per cup. This gives you a more accurate cup measurement for your unique blend. Always measure cooked food.

Splitting daily portions into two meals is common. This helps with digestion. It also keeps your dog feeling full. For a 70 lb dog needing 4 cups daily, feed 2 cups in the morning and 2 cups in the evening. Adjust meal times to fit your schedule.

Remember that these are guidelines. Watch your dog's weight and energy. If your dog gains weight, reduce the portion slightly. If they lose weight, increase it. Consistency in measurement helps you identify problems quickly.

## Key Ingredients for a Balanced 70 Lb Dog Diet

Creating a balanced diet is essential for your 70 lb dog. Homemade food lets you pick high-quality ingredients. A balanced diet supports all bodily functions. It helps your large dog thrive. Knowing the right components for **homemade dog food for 70 lb dog** is key.

### Protein Sources

Protein is vital for muscle maintenance and repair. It forms enzymes and hormones. For a 70 lb dog, protein should be a significant part of the diet. Aim for lean protein sources.

*   **Chicken:** Boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs. Cooked and shredded.
*   **Turkey:** Lean ground turkey or breast meat.
*   **Beef:** Lean ground beef, sirloin, or stew meat. Remove excess fat.
*   **Fish:** Salmon, cod, or sardines (canned in water, no salt). Cooked and deboned.
*   **Eggs:** Cooked eggs provide excellent protein.

Always cook meat thoroughly. Raw meat carries risks.

### Complex Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates provide energy. Choose complex carbs for sustained energy release. They also offer fiber for digestion.

*   **Brown Rice:** Cooked well, it's easily digestible.
*   **Quinoa:** A complete protein and good carbohydrate source.
*   **Sweet Potatoes:** Boiled or baked, a great source of vitamins and fiber.
*   **Oats:** Plain rolled oats, cooked, are good for sensitive stomachs.
*   **Pumpkin:** Canned pure pumpkin (not pie filling) is excellent for digestion.

### Healthy Fats

Fats are concentrated energy sources. They also provide essential fatty acids for skin and coat health.

*   **Fish Oil:** A great source of Omega-3 fatty acids. Add after cooking.
*   **Flaxseed Oil:** Another source of Omega-3s.
*   **Cooked Meat Fats:** Natural fats from your protein source in moderation.

Avoid excessive fat. It can lead to pancreatitis in some dogs.

### Vitamins and Minerals

Vegetables provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They add bulk without many calories.

*   **Green Beans:** Cooked, chopped.
*   **Carrots:** Cooked, diced.
*   **Broccoli:** Steamed, chopped (in moderation).
*   **Spinach:** Cooked, in small amounts.

Some ingredients are crucial for overall dog health. For specific recommendations, you might review [what is the best homemade food to feed a dog](https://beacleaner.com/what-is-the-best-homemade-food-to-feed-a-dog). You must also add a veterinary-specific multivitamin and mineral supplement. Homemade diets are often deficient without it. Consult your vet for the right supplement. Variety is key. Rotate ingredients over time to ensure a broad spectrum of nutrients.

## Adjusting Food Portions for Individual 70 Lb Dogs

Every 70 lb dog is unique. What works for one dog may not work for another. You must adjust **homemade dog food for 70 lb dog** based on individual needs. Monitoring your dog's weight and body condition is crucial. This helps you fine-tune their diet.

### Monitoring Body Condition

I use a simple method: the Body Condition Score (BCS). This is a visual and hands-on assessment.
*   **Ideal Weight:** You should easily feel your dog's ribs, but not see them. Their waist should be visible from above. An abdominal tuck should be present from the side.
*   **Overweight:** Ribs are hard to feel under fat. No visible waist. Abdominal tuck is absent.
*   **Underweight:** Ribs, spine, and hip bones are easily visible. No fat covering.

Check your dog's BCS weekly. This helps you catch changes early. Early detection means faster adjustments to their diet.

### Factors Affecting Portions

Several factors influence a 70 lb dog's food needs:
*   **Age:** Growing puppies need more calories. Senior dogs often need fewer. Their metabolism slows down.
*   **Breed:** Some breeds are naturally more active. They burn more calories. Others are prone to weight gain.
*   **Health Conditions:** Dogs with certain illnesses might need special diets. For example, a dog with kidney disease needs lower protein. A dog with diabetes needs careful carb control. Always consult your vet for these conditions.
*   **Season:** Dogs might burn more calories in cold weather. They need more food to stay warm. Hot weather might reduce their activity, requiring less food.
*   **Activity Level Changes:** If your dog starts a new exercise routine, they need more food. If they become less active, reduce their portions.

### Signs to Watch For

*   **Weight Gain:** If your dog's ribs are becoming harder to feel, reduce food.
*   **Weight Loss:** If ribs become very prominent, increase food slightly.
*   **Energy Levels:** A healthy dog has good energy. Lethargy or hyperactivity can signal nutrient imbalances.
*   **Coat Condition:** A dull, dry coat can indicate a lack of essential fats.

Making diet adjustments requires patience. Change food amounts gradually. Small adjustments over several days are best. This prevents digestive upset. Always involve your veterinarian. They offer expert advice. This is especially important for [how much homemade food should i feed my 80 pound dog](https://beacleaner.com/how-much-homemade-food-should-i-feed-my-80-pound-dog) or similar large breeds, as slight differences in weight can impact calculations.

## Homemade Dog Food Preparation and Safety for Large Breeds

Preparing homemade dog food for your 70 lb dog requires careful attention. Safety and proper preparation ensure the food is nutritious and safe. My goal is to prevent any health risks. This section covers important aspects of cooking and storage.

### Cooking Methods

All raw meat and eggs must be thoroughly cooked. This eliminates harmful bacteria.
*   **Boiling:** A simple method for meats and many vegetables. Boil chicken or beef until no pink remains. Cook vegetables until tender.
*   **Baking:** Good for meat loaves or batches of food. Bake at an appropriate temperature until fully cooked.
*   **Steaming:** Best for retaining nutrients in vegetables. Steam until tender-crisp.
*   **Slow Cooking:** Excellent for breaking down tougher cuts of meat. Ensures thorough cooking.

Avoid adding excessive oils or seasonings during cooking. Dogs do not need spices or salt. Keep it plain.

### Avoiding Toxic Ingredients

Many human foods are dangerous for dogs. Always be aware of these.
*   **Onions and Garlic:** These cause red blood cell damage. Avoid all forms, including powder.
*   **Xylitol:** A sugar substitute found in many human foods. It is highly toxic.
*   **Grapes and Raisins:** Cause kidney failure.
*   **Chocolate:** Contains theobromine, which is toxic.
*   **Avocado:** Contains persin, which can be toxic in large amounts.
*   **Macadamia Nuts:** Cause weakness and vomiting.
*   **Alcohol:** Extremely toxic.
*   **Cooked Bones:** Cooked bones splinter. They pose a choking hazard. They also cause internal damage.

Always double-check ingredients. If unsure, do not include it.

### Ensuring Complete Nutrition

Homemade diets often lack essential nutrients. It's difficult to balance everything perfectly.
*   **Veterinary Supplements:** I always recommend a vet-approved multivitamin and mineral supplement. This fills any nutritional gaps. Your vet can recommend the best one for your 70 lb dog.
*   **Calcium and Phosphorus Ratio:** This ratio is critical for large breed dogs. Imbalances can lead to bone issues. Supplements help maintain the correct ratio.
*   **Essential Fatty Acids:** While fish oil is good, ensure overall fat balance.

### Storage Guidelines

Proper storage prevents spoilage and bacterial growth. This ensures your **70 lb dog homemade food** remains fresh.
*   **Refrigeration:** Store cooked food in airtight containers. It typically lasts 3-4 days in the refrigerator.
*   **Freezing:** For longer storage, freeze portions. Use freezer-safe bags or containers. Homemade food can last 2-3 months in the freezer. Thaw frozen food in the refrigerator before serving.
*   **Portioning:** Divide food into daily or meal-sized portions before freezing. This makes meal prep easier.

For detailed information on safe storage durations, you can read more here: [how long can homemade dog food last in the fridge](https://beacleaner.com/how-long-can-homemade-dog-food-last-in-the-fridge). Always smell and visually inspect food before serving. Discard anything that looks or smells off.

## Common Mistakes When Feeding Homemade Dog Food to a 70 Lb Dog

Making homemade food for your 70 lb dog shows great care. However, common mistakes can harm your dog's health. I want to help you avoid these pitfalls. Ensuring proper nutrition is vital for a large breed dog.

### 1. Not Balancing Nutrients

This is the biggest mistake. Many homemade diets lack essential nutrients. Dogs need precise ratios of protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Simply feeding cooked meat and rice is not enough. This can lead to severe deficiencies over time.

For example, an unbalanced calcium-to-phosphorus ratio can cause bone problems. This is especially risky for large breed dogs. Always use a veterinary-approved recipe. Consult a veterinary nutritionist for guidance. They can help create a balanced plan.

### 2. Over-relying on Single Ingredients

Feeding the same few ingredients limits nutrient diversity. Your dog needs a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Providing only chicken and carrots might miss critical components. Rotation of protein sources, grains, and vegetables is beneficial.

Varying ingredients ensures a broader spectrum of nutrients. It also keeps mealtime interesting for your dog. A diverse diet supports robust health. Think about adding different lean meats or starchy vegetables throughout the week.

### 3. Ignoring Calorie Density

Different homemade food ingredients have different calorie counts. A cup of lean chicken is very different from a cup of beef stew. Not accounting for this can lead to over or underfeeding. This is why weighing food is so important.

If your recipe is high in fat, it will be calorie-dense. You will feed fewer grams. If it is leaner, you will feed more grams. Understanding the calorie content of your specific recipe is crucial for a 70 lb dog.

### 4. Not Monitoring Body Condition

Some pet owners feed a set amount without checking their dog. This fixed approach ignores changes in a dog's activity or age. Your 70 lb dog's needs evolve over time. Regularly assessing their body condition score is essential.

If your dog gains too much weight, reduce food slightly. If they look too thin, increase it. Ignoring these changes can lead to obesity or malnourishment. Consistent monitoring helps you make necessary adjustments promptly.

### 5. Lack of Regular Vet Check-ups

Even with a well-planned homemade diet, vet check-ups are non-negotiable. Your vet can spot early signs of nutritional imbalance. They can run blood tests to check for deficiencies. They also monitor overall health.

Your veterinarian or a board-certified veterinary nutritionist can adjust your diet plan. They ensure it meets your dog's changing needs. This partnership is key for long-term health. Never guess when it comes to your 70 lb dog's nutrition.

### 6. Using Supplements Incorrectly

Adding random human supplements to homemade dog food is dangerous. Dogs have different nutritional requirements than humans. Some human supplements can be toxic or lead to imbalances. For example, too much vitamin D can be harmful.

Always use supplements specifically formulated for dogs. Discuss any supplements with your veterinarian first. They will advise on type and dosage. This ensures safety and effectiveness for your 70 lb dog. You might even discuss specific additions like [how much turmeric do i put in homemade dog food](https://beacleaner.com/how-much-turmeric-do-i-put-in-homemade-dog-food) with them to ensure it's appropriate.
