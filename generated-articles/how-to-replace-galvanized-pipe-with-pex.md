### How do you replace galvanized pipe with PEX?

To replace galvanized pipe with PEX, first shut off the water supply and drain lines. Cut out old galvanized sections. Use transition fittings, such as SharkBite connectors, to join the remaining galvanized pipe to new PEX tubing. Run the flexible PEX lines, make connections with crimp or expansion tools, and then test the system for leaks.

## Why Replace Galvanized Pipes in Your Home?

Galvanized pipes were once common for plumbing. These steel pipes have a zinc coating. This coating protects against rust. Over time, this zinc coating wears away.

Once the coating is gone, the steel begins to rust. Rust forms inside the pipes. This buildup reduces the inner diameter. This leads to lower water pressure throughout your home. You might notice weak shower flow or slow-filling sinks. Rust particles can also break free and travel with your water. This causes discolored water, often appearing brown or reddish. You might see these rust flakes in your bathtub or toilet.

Beyond flow issues, corroding galvanized pipes can pose health risks. They might contain lead. Lead was a common element in some zinc coatings or in the solder used to join sections. As pipes degrade, lead can leach into your drinking water. This is a serious concern, especially for children. Corroded pipes are also more prone to leaks and bursts. This can cause significant water damage to your home. [Cleaning galvanized pipes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-galvanized-pipe) helps temporarily, but replacement is the long-term solution.

Many homeowners choose to replace galvanized pipes for these reasons. The process improves water quality and pressure. It also increases home value and safety. Replacing them prevents future costly repairs from leaks or burst pipes. It is a worthwhile investment for any home with old plumbing.

## Understanding PEX Plumbing Systems

PEX stands for cross-linked polyethylene. It is a flexible plastic tubing material. Plumbers use PEX for water supply lines. It has become very popular. PEX offers many benefits over traditional metal pipes.

One main advantage of PEX is its flexibility. You can bend PEX around corners. This reduces the number of fittings needed. Fewer fittings mean fewer potential leak points. PEX also resists corrosion. Unlike metal pipes, PEX does not rust or corrode. This means clean water and consistent flow over time. PEX can also expand and contract. This makes it highly resistant to burst pipes from freezing. This is a big plus in cold climates.

There are different types of PEX, primarily PEX-A, PEX-B, and PEX-C. PEX-A is the most flexible. It uses an expansion fitting system. PEX-B is slightly stiffer. It typically uses crimp or clamp connections. PEX-C is the least common and less flexible. Each type has its own installation method. For most DIYers, PEX-A with its expansion fittings or PEX-B with crimp rings are good choices.

PEX is also cost-effective. The material itself is cheaper than copper. Installation is faster and requires fewer specialized tools. This saves on labor costs if you hire a professional. It also reduces material costs for DIY projects. PEX plumbing systems offer a modern, durable, and efficient solution for your home's water supply. You get peace of mind with a reliable plumbing system.

## Essential Tools and Materials for PEX Installation

Before you begin replacing your galvanized pipes, gather the right tools and materials. Having everything ready saves time and frustration. A well-stocked toolbox is key for any plumbing project.

First, you will need PEX tubing. Choose the correct diameter to match your existing pipes or water flow needs. PEX comes in rolls, which is great for long runs. You will also need PEX fittings. These include elbows, tees, and couplings. Make sure to get fittings compatible with your chosen PEX connection method. These connections can be crimp, clamp, or expansion.

For cutting, a PEX pipe cutter is essential. It makes clean, straight cuts. This ensures good connections. Next, you need a tool for making connections. If you use crimp rings, you need a PEX crimp tool. If you choose cinch clamps, you need a PEX cinch tool. For PEX-A expansion fittings, an expansion tool is necessary. Pick the tool that matches your PEX system.

You will also need transition fittings. These fittings connect your new PEX lines to the existing galvanized pipes. SharkBite fittings are a popular choice for this. They allow for a simple push-to-connect installation. This avoids threading new connections onto old galvanized pipe. You might also need pipe wrenches to loosen old galvanized fittings. Other basic tools include a tape measure, marker, and safety glasses. Have buckets and rags ready for water spills.

Finally, consider a pressure gauge. This helps you test your new system for leaks after installation. A successful PEX installation depends on having all these items on hand. Proper tools make the job easier and more secure.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Replacing Galvanized with PEX

Replacing galvanized pipes with PEX involves careful planning and execution. Follow these steps for a smooth upgrade. Remember, working with water lines requires attention to detail.

### 1. Plan Your Layout and Shut Off Water

Start by mapping your current galvanized pipe system. Decide which sections you want to replace first. It is often best to work on one branch at a time. This keeps parts of your home with water. Locate your main water shut-off valve. Turn off the main water supply to your house. Open faucets at the lowest point in your home to drain the pipes. This removes water from the system. Have buckets ready to catch any remaining water.

### 2. Disconnect and Remove Old Galvanized Pipe Sections

Identify the section of galvanized pipe you will replace. Use pipe wrenches to loosen the old fittings. Galvanized pipes are heavy and might be corroded. They can be hard to disconnect. Be ready for some effort. Cut out sections of the old pipe. A reciprocating saw with a metal-cutting blade works well. Remove the old pipe carefully. Avoid damaging surrounding structures.

### 3. Make the Transition from Galvanized to PEX

This is a critical step. You need to connect your new PEX to the remaining galvanized pipe. [SharkBite fittings](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-connect-sharkbite-to-galvanized-pipe) are excellent for this. They offer a reliable, push-fit connection. First, clean the end of the galvanized pipe. Remove any rust or debris. Ensure the pipe end is smooth. Push the SharkBite fitting onto the galvanized pipe. It creates a watertight seal. Then, push your PEX tubing into the other end of the SharkBite fitting. This creates a secure connection without soldering or threading.

### 4. Run Your New PEX Lines

With the transition made, you can now run your PEX tubing. PEX's flexibility is a huge advantage here. You can snake it through walls and joists. Measure the length needed for each run. Cut the PEX cleanly with a PEX cutter. Avoid kinks. Use PEX clips or straps to secure the tubing. Support the PEX tubing at regular intervals. This prevents sagging and protects the pipe. Plan your runs to minimize connections.

### 5. Make PEX Connections to Fixtures and Other Lines

At each fixture (sink, toilet, shower) or connection point, attach PEX fittings. Use your chosen PEX connection method. For crimp or cinch rings, slide the ring onto the PEX. Insert the fitting. Then, use your crimp or cinch tool to secure the connection. For expansion fittings, use the expansion tool to widen the PEX end. Insert the fitting, and the PEX will shrink back to form a tight seal. Ensure all connections are tight and secure. Double-check each fitting. If you need to connect PEX to other pipe types like PVC in different parts of your system, know that [you can connect PEX pipe to PVC](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-connect-pex-pipe-to-pvc) using specific adapters.

### 6. Test the System for Leaks

Once all connections are complete, it is time to test. Slowly turn the main water supply back on. Listen for any sounds of rushing water or drips. Visually inspect every connection point. Look for any signs of leaks. It is a good idea to leave paper towels under new connections. This helps spot small drips. If you find a leak, turn off the water. Re-tighten the fitting or re-do the connection. Address all leaks before you close up walls or floors. A successful test ensures your new PEX system is ready for use.

## Important Considerations and Plumbing Codes

Replacing your home's plumbing is a big project. It requires careful thought beyond the physical installation. Understanding local plumbing codes is crucial. Codes ensure your plumbing is safe and functional. They protect your home and public health.
