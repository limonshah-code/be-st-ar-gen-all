### How do you clean a snake eyes piercing?

You clean a snake eyes piercing by gently rinsing it with sterile saline solution two times daily. Use alcohol-free mouthwash after meals. Avoid touching the piercing. Keep your hands clean when handling the area. This approach reduces bacteria and supports healing.

## Understanding Your Snake Eyes Piercing and Its Needs

A snake eyes piercing goes horizontally through the tip of the tongue. This placement gives it the appearance of snake eyes. It involves two separate piercing points connected by a single piece of jewelry. This makes it a surface piercing on the tongue. Oral piercings, like the snake eyes, require special care. The mouth contains many bacteria. This environment makes infections a higher risk.

The tongue is a muscle. It moves constantly. This constant movement can irritate the piercing. Irritation prolongs the healing time. It also increases the risk of complications. Understanding these factors helps you clean your snake eyes piercing effectively. You can avoid common mistakes. Proper cleaning directly impacts healing success.

Your piercer will give you initial aftercare instructions. Always follow these instructions closely. They are specific to your new piercing. This general guide offers comprehensive steps. It supports your healing journey. Good care ensures your snake eyes piercing remains a cherished body art.

### The Anatomy of a Snake Eyes Piercing

The snake eyes piercing involves two small holes at the very tip of your tongue. A curved barbell connects these two points. This specific jewelry design allows the "snake eyes" look. The piercing sits near the frenulum, the tissue under your tongue. This location is delicate. It makes precise cleaning important.

The tongue muscle has many blood vessels. This rich blood supply can aid healing. However, it also means more bleeding can occur initially. The constant movement of the tongue also puts stress on the piercing. You must minimize tongue movement during the healing phase. This helps the tissue repair properly.

Piercings in the mouth are different from ear or body piercings. The oral environment introduces unique challenges. Food particles, saliva, and plaque can build up around the jewelry. This buildup can harbor bacteria. Regular, thorough cleaning prevents these issues. This ensures your snake eyes piercing stays healthy.

## Essential Supplies for Cleaning Your Snake Eyes Piercing

Before you start cleaning your snake eyes piercing, gather your supplies. Using the right products is very important. Avoid harsh chemicals or homemade solutions. These can irritate the piercing. They can also slow down healing. Stick to simple, sterile options.

*   **Sterile Saline Solution:** This is your primary cleaning agent. You can buy pre-made sterile saline wound wash. Look for products that contain 0.9% sodium chloride and purified water only. Do not use contact lens solution. It has additives that can harm your piercing.
*   **Alcohol-Free Mouthwash:** You will use this after eating. It helps rinse away food particles. Choose a mouthwash specifically designed for oral piercings or a gentle, non-alcoholic option. Alcohol can dry out and irritate the piercing.
*   **Soft-Bristled Toothbrush:** Maintain good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth regularly. A soft toothbrush protects your new piercing from accidental bumps.
*   **Disposable Paper Towels or Gauze:** Use these for drying the area. Cloth towels can harbor bacteria. They can also snag on the jewelry.
*   **Mild, Unscented Soap (for hands):** You must wash your hands thoroughly before touching your piercing. This prevents transferring germs.

Having these items ready makes your cleaning routine easy. It also ensures you clean your snake eyes piercing safely. Always check expiration dates on sterile products. Using fresh, clean supplies is a key part of proper aftercare. This helps prevent infection and promotes faster healing.

### Choosing the Right Saline Solution

The best saline solution is a sterile wound wash. It contains only 0.9% sodium chloride and sterile water. You can often find it in pharmacies. Look for a spray bottle. This allows for a gentle, direct application. This type of solution is isotonic. It matches the body's natural salinity. This helps clean without causing irritation.

Do not make your own salt solution. It is difficult to get the correct salt-to-water ratio. Too much salt can dry out the piercing. Too little salt may not be effective. Homemade solutions are also not sterile. This means they can introduce bacteria. This increases your risk of infection. Always choose a sterile, pre-packaged saline solution. This provides the safest and most effective cleaning for your snake eyes piercing. Proper use of saline solution is key. It helps heal your piercing well.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Snake Eyes Piercing

Cleaning your snake eyes piercing is a simple process. Consistency is key. You should clean your piercing at least twice a day. Clean it first thing in the morning. Clean it again before bed. Follow these steps carefully to ensure proper hygiene and promote healing.

1.  **Wash Your Hands Thoroughly:** This is the most critical first step. Use a mild, unscented antibacterial soap. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. Make sure your hands are completely clean. This prevents introducing bacteria to your mouth.
2.  **Perform an Oral Rinse:** Before touching the piercing, rinse your mouth. Use your alcohol-free mouthwash. Swish it around gently for 30-60 seconds. This removes loose food particles and initial bacteria.
3.  **Inspect the Piercing:** Look at your piercing in a mirror. Check for any signs of irritation or infection. Notice any redness, swelling, or discharge. A little clear or yellowish discharge is normal. Green or foul-smelling discharge is not.
4.  **Apply Saline Solution:** Spray sterile saline solution directly onto the piercing. Make sure to cover both the top and bottom of the jewelry. You can also soak a clean paper towel or gauze with saline. Gently press it onto the piercing for a few minutes. This softens any crusties.
5.  **Remove Crusties (Gently):** After soaking, gently wipe away any softened crusties. Use a fresh, clean paper towel or gauze. Do not pick or force off any dry crusts. This can irritate the healing tissue. Do not rotate or move the jewelry.
6.  **Rinse Again:** After cleaning, take another quick rinse with water. This removes any excess saline.
7.  **Dry the Area (Carefully):** Gently pat the area dry with a clean paper towel. Do not rub. Keeping the area dry helps prevent moisture buildup. Excessive moisture can lead to bacterial growth.
8.  **Repeat Daily:** Follow this routine twice a day. Stick to this schedule even if your piercing feels fine. Consistent cleaning is vital for good healing.

Remember, patience is important. Your snake eyes piercing needs time to heal. Do not rush the process. Following these steps helps your body heal efficiently.

### After Eating or Drinking

Your mouth is active. You eat and drink multiple times a day. Food particles can get trapped around your snake eyes piercing. This can lead to bacterial growth. This increases the risk of infection.

*   **Rinse After Every Meal:** After you eat or drink anything other than water, rinse your mouth. Use your alcohol-free mouthwash. Swish it gently for about 30 seconds. This removes food debris and cleans the area.
*   **Drink Water Regularly:** Staying hydrated helps your body heal. Water also helps wash away loose particles naturally. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
*   **Avoid certain foods:** Spicy, acidic, or crunchy foods can irritate your new piercing. Stick to soft, bland foods initially. Avoid sticky foods that can cling to the jewelry.
*   **Brush Teeth Gently:** Continue your normal oral hygiene routine. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush. Be extra careful around the piercing. You want to clean your teeth without disturbing the healing tissue.

This diligent rinsing schedule complements your daily saline cleanings. It creates a clean environment for your snake eyes piercing. [For tips on cleaning jewelry, see this guide: How to Clean Piercing Jewelry.](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-piercing-jewelry)

## What to Avoid During the Healing Process

Knowing what to avoid is as important as knowing what to do. Certain actions or substances can hinder healing. They can also cause complications. Your snake eyes piercing is delicate. Treat it with care during its healing phase.

*   **Do Not Touch Your Piercing:** Never touch your piercing with unwashed hands. Hands carry germs. Touching introduces bacteria. This raises the risk of infection. Avoid playing with the jewelry.
*   **Avoid Alcohol and Peroxide:** These substances are too harsh. They dry out the skin. They can damage healing cells. Never use alcohol or hydrogen peroxide on your piercing.
*   **Do Not Use Cotton Swabs or Q-Tips:** The fibers from cotton swabs can get caught in the jewelry. This can cause irritation. It can also leave fibers inside the piercing channel. Use paper towels or gauze instead.

*   **Avoid Spinning or Rotating Jewelry:** This is an old myth. Moving the jewelry does not help healing. It actually irritates the fresh wound. This can tear new tissue. It also pushes bacteria into the piercing. Leave the jewelry alone.
*   **Stay Away from Pools, Lakes, and Hot Tubs:** These water sources contain bacteria. They can lead to severe infections. Avoid swimming during the initial healing period.
*   **Limit Oral Contact:** Avoid kissing, oral sex, and sharing food or drinks. This transfers bacteria. It significantly increases infection risk. This is crucial for oral piercings.
*   **Do Not Change Jewelry Prematurely:** Your piercer will tell you when it is safe to change your jewelry. Changing it too soon can damage the healing tissue. It can also cause the piercing to close. Always let a professional change your initial jewelry. Ensure you [clean piercing jewelry before putting it in](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-piercing-jewelry-before-putting-it-in) if you do change it.

Following these avoidance guidelines helps ensure a smooth healing process. Your snake eyes piercing relies on your care. Ignoring these warnings can lead to pain and complications.

### Dietary Considerations for Healing Snake Eyes Piercings

Your diet plays a role in healing. What you eat affects your oral environment. It also affects the piercing directly. Making smart food choices helps speed up recovery.

*   **Stick to Soft Foods:** For the first few weeks, eat soft foods. Mashed potatoes, yogurt, smoothies, and soft pasta are good choices. These require less chewing. They reduce tongue movement.
*   **Avoid Spicy and Acidic Foods:** Hot sauce, citrus fruits, and vinegar can irritate the fresh piercing. They cause burning or stinging. This pain can hinder healing.
*   **Steer Clear of Sticky and Crunchy Foods:** Caramel, gum, chips, and nuts can get stuck in the jewelry. They can also damage the healing tissue. Small pieces can become lodged in the piercing channel. This can lead to irritation or infection.
*   **Limit Dairy Products:** Some people find dairy products cause excess film in their mouth. This film can accumulate around the piercing. This may promote bacterial growth. Monitor how dairy affects you.
*   **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water. Water helps flush the mouth. It keeps the area clean. It also aids your body's natural healing processes.

Choosing appropriate foods supports the healing of your snake eyes piercing. It prevents unnecessary irritation. It also helps maintain a cleaner oral environment. This reduces the chance of complications.

## Recognizing and Addressing Complications

Even with the best care, complications can happen. Knowing what to look for helps you act quickly. Early intervention can prevent serious problems. Pay attention to your snake eyes piercing daily.

### Signs of Infection

An infected piercing needs medical attention. Do not try to treat it yourself.

*   **Severe Redness and Swelling:** Some redness and swelling are normal initially. If it worsens, spreads, or becomes very painful, it may be infection.
*   **Pus or Green/Yellow Discharge:** Clear or whitish fluid is normal. Thick, opaque, green, or yellowish pus indicates infection. It often has a foul smell.
*   **Increased Pain:** Pain should lessen over time. If pain increases, becomes throbbing, or is unbearable, seek help.
*   **Fever or Chills:** These are systemic signs of infection. They mean the infection is spreading. See a doctor immediately.
*   **Hot to the Touch:** The area around the piercing feels unusually warm. This points to inflammation or infection.
*   **Red Streaks:** Red lines spreading from the piercing site are serious. They indicate a spreading infection. This needs urgent medical care.

If you suspect an infection, contact your piercer. More importantly, see a doctor. Do not remove the jewelry unless a doctor tells you to. Removing the jewelry can trap the infection inside. This can make it worse.

### Signs of Irritation

Irritation is different from infection. It usually resolves with better aftercare.

*   **Mild Redness and Swelling:** Less severe than infection signs. It might come from bumping the piercing or eating wrong foods.
*   **Slight Tenderness:** The piercing feels sensitive, but not intensely painful.
*   **Clear or White Discharge:** This is lymph fluid. It is part of normal healing. It is not pus.
*   **Crusties:** Dried lymph fluid forms crusts around the jewelry. This is normal.
*   **Migration:** The jewelry moves from its original placement. This can happen if the body rejects the piercing.
*   **Scar Tissue/Bumps:** Small bumps may form around the piercing. These are usually irritation bumps or hypertrophic scarring.

To address irritation, review your aftercare. Are you cleaning enough? Are you touching it? Are you eating irritating foods? Adjust your routine. If irritation persists, consult your piercer. They can offer advice. They can suggest specific products.

## The Healing Timeline for Snake Eyes Piercings

Understanding the healing timeline helps you manage expectations. It also tells you how long to keep up rigorous aftercare. Snake eyes piercings typically take longer to heal than earlobes. Their location in the mouth plays a big part.

*   **Initial Healing (First 2-4 Weeks):** During this phase, you will experience swelling and some pain. The piercing is an open wound. You must follow aftercare strictly. Swelling might make talking or eating difficult. Ice chips can help reduce swelling.
*   **Primary Healing (2-4 Months):** The external wounds close during this time. The internal piercing channel begins to form. You might still see some clear discharge or crusties. You must continue daily cleaning. Reduce tongue movement as much as possible.
*   **Full Healing (4-6+ Months):** The piercing channel becomes fully formed and strong. All discharge should stop. The area will no longer be tender. You can consider changing jewelry during this phase. Always consult your piercer first.

Healing times vary for each person. Factors like general health, diet, and strictness of aftercare affect it. Some people heal faster. Others may take longer. Do not rush the process. If you have concerns, speak to your piercer. They can assess your progress. They offer personalized advice.

### Factors Affecting Healing

Several factors influence how quickly your snake eyes piercing heals. Being aware of these helps you optimize your recovery.

*   **General Health:** A healthy body heals faster. Good nutrition, adequate sleep, and low stress levels support healing.
