### Basic Cleaning Arsenal

Start with common household items. You will need hot water. Dish soap is also important. Choose a dish soap with degreasing power. You also need a sturdy brush. A stiff nylon brush works well. Avoid wire brushes. They can scratch the basket. A sponge or cloth helps with lighter cleaning.

Baking soda is a great natural abrasive. White vinegar helps cut grease and odors. These two items are very versatile. They can tackle many cleaning jobs. You might also want paper towels. They help wipe away loose grease. Having these items ready speeds up the process.

For extra tough grease, consider a commercial degreaser. These cleaners are strong. They dissolve hardened oil quickly. Always check the product label. Ensure it is safe for your basket material.

### Safety Gear

## Step-by-Step Method: The Hot Water Soak

The hot water soak is a primary method. It softens grease and stuck-on food. This makes scrubbing much easier. Most cleaning jobs start here. This method works for regular maintenance. It also helps with moderate buildup.

You need a large basin or sink. Fill it with very hot water. Add a generous amount of dish soap. Make sure the water is as hot as you can stand. The heat helps break down the grease. Let the basket sit for a while.

Patience is key with this step. Do not rush the soaking process. The longer it soaks, the easier it cleans. This step alone can remove much of the grime. It sets you up for success.

### Initial Preparation

Before soaking, remove loose food. Scrape off any large pieces. Use a rubber spatula or paper towel. This prevents clogging your drain. It also keeps the soaking water cleaner. Do this over a trash can.

Wipe excess oil from the basket. Use paper towels. This reduces the amount of grease entering your sink. It makes the water stay cleaner longer. It also lessens the overall cleaning effort. A quick pre-wipe saves time later.

Check the basket for any detachable parts. Some baskets have removable handles. Clean these parts separately if needed. Most fryer baskets are one piece. Ensure you access all areas.

### Soaking Process

Place the fryer basket into the hot, soapy water. Ensure it is fully submerged. Add more hot water if needed. Let the basket soak for at least 30 minutes. For heavy grease, soak for several hours. You can even soak it overnight.

The hot water and soap work together. They dissolve the oil. They loosen the food particles. You will see the water change color. This means the grease is lifting. This is a good sign.

You can add a cup of white vinegar to the soak. Vinegar helps cut through grease. It also acts as a deodorizer. This is an extra boost for tough messes. [Cleaning with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-with-vinegar) is a versatile option for many tasks.

### Scrubbing and Rinsing

After soaking, remove the basket. The grease should be soft. Use a nylon scrub brush. Gently scrub all surfaces. Pay attention to corners and mesh. These areas collect a lot of buildup. A good scrub removes the loosened grime.

For stubborn spots, use a bit of baking soda. Sprinkle it directly on the area. Scrub with the brush. The baking soda acts as a mild abrasive. It helps lift stuck-on bits. Be gentle to avoid scratches.

Rinse the basket thoroughly under hot running water. Ensure all soap residue is gone. Check for any remaining grease. Repeat scrubbing if needed. A clean rinse means no soap taste on your food. Finally, dry the basket completely. You can air dry or use a towel. Drying stops rust.

### Commercial Degreasers

Commercial degreasers are powerful. They are designed for heavy grease. These products work quickly. They are good for deep cleaning sessions. Read the instructions carefully. Some need dilution. Others are ready to use.

Spray or apply the degreaser to the basket. Let it sit for the recommended time. This time is usually short. It can be 5-10 minutes. The degreaser breaks down the oil. It turns it into a liquid. Then, scrub and rinse thoroughly.

Always wear gloves and eye protection. Use these products in a well-ventilated area. Fumes can be strong. Ensure all degreaser is rinsed off. Residue can affect food taste. It can also be unsafe.

### Removing Carbonized Buildup

Try the baking soda and vinegar method first. This often helps lift carbon. For very stubborn carbon, you might need a scraper. Use a plastic or wooden scraper. Avoid metal ones. Metal can scratch the basket. Gently scrape at the carbonized areas.

You can also try boiling the basket. Fill a large pot with water. Add a few tablespoons of dish soap. Place the basket in the pot. Boil for 15-30 minutes. This softens the carbon.
