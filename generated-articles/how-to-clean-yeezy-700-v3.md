## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Clean Yeezy 700 V3 Uppers

Cleaning the upper part of your Yeezy 700 V3 needs careful attention. This is where most visible dirt collects. The upper features a unique combination of Primeknit fabric and an RPU cage. Each material requires a gentle touch. This section breaks down the process into easy steps.

### Preparing Your Yeezys for Cleaning

Start by removing the laces and insoles from your shoes. Set them aside for separate cleaning. Use a dry, soft-bristled brush to remove loose dirt. Brush away any surface dust or mud. Do this gently to avoid embedding dirt deeper. This initial step makes the main cleaning much easier. It also prevents dirt from turning into muddy smears.

### Cleaning the Primeknit/Mesh Fabric

The Primeknit and mesh are the shoe's main fabric areas. These are delicate. Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water in a bowl. Dip your soft-bristled brush into the solution. Gently scrub the fabric in circular motions. Do not press too hard. You just want to lift the dirt. Focus on one small area at a time. This prevents the fabric from getting overly wet.

After scrubbing a section, wipe it clean with a damp microfiber cloth. Make sure to remove all soap residue. Leftover soap can attract more dirt. It can also cause discoloration. Repeat this process until all fabric areas look clean. Remember to be patient and gentle. This protects the integrity of the Primeknit.

### Tackling the RPU Cage and Overlays

The RPU cage is the structured part that wraps around the shoe. This material is more durable than Primeknit. You can use the same mild soap solution. Dip a soft brush or old toothbrush into the mix. Gently scrub the cage, focusing on crevices. Dirt often gets trapped in these areas.

For stubborn spots on the cage, you can use a bit more pressure. However, still be careful. Wipe the cage clean with a damp cloth after scrubbing. Ensure all soap is gone. This careful approach helps maintain the cage's texture and color. It ensures the whole upper looks uniform.

## Cleaning the Midsoles and Outsoles of Your Yeezy 700 V3

The midsoles and outsoles of your Yeezy 700 V3 face the most direct contact with the ground. They collect stubborn dirt and grime. Cleaning these parts is key for a complete refresh. The unique design of the 700 V3 midsole, with its sculpted lines, also needs specific attention.

### Refreshing the Sculpted Midsole

The midsole of the Yeezy 700 V3 is made from EVA foam. This material can get scuffed and dirty easily. Use a slightly stiffer brush than you used for the upper. Dip it in your mild soap and warm water solution. Scrub the midsole vigorously. Focus on any scuff marks or embedded dirt. The sculpted lines can trap grime. Use an old toothbrush to get into these grooves.

Work in small sections. Apply steady pressure to lift stains. Once a section is clean, wipe it with a damp microfiber cloth. Remove all soap residue. You can re-dampen the cloth and wipe again to ensure thorough rinsing. A clean midsole makes a huge difference in the shoe's overall look. Understanding general cleaning methods, such as those that apply to [how to clean everything](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-everything) in your home, often includes tips for different surfaces like these.

### Deep Cleaning the Rubber Outsole

The outsole is the bottom part of your shoe. It deals with the most dirt. Start by removing any large debris like small rocks or mud. You can use a toothpick or a firm brush for this. Then, use your stiff brush and the soap solution. Scrub the outsole treads thoroughly. The textured patterns can hold a lot of dirt.

Rinse the outsole well under running water. Or, wipe it repeatedly with a very damp cloth. Make sure no dirt remains trapped in the treads. For very tough stains on the outsole, you can try a small amount of concentrated soap. Scrub it with extra force. Always rinse thoroughly afterward. A clean outsole provides better grip and completes the fresh look of your Yeezys. This detailed attention to the outsole is similar to maintaining any frequently used surface.

## Restoring Laces and Insoles to Freshness

While cleaning the main body of your Yeezy 700 V3, do not forget the laces and insoles. These small components collect dirt and odors. Cleaning them separately makes a big difference. It helps your shoes feel completely fresh. Neglecting them can make your newly cleaned shoes still smell or look dingy.

Start with the laces. They can be hand-washed or machine-washed. For hand washing, place them in a bowl with warm water and a small amount of mild soap. Gently rub the laces together. This helps lift dirt and grime. Rinse them thoroughly under running water until no soap remains. You can also put laces in a mesh laundry bag. Then, machine wash them on a gentle cycle. This option is great for convenience.

Next, turn your attention to the insoles. Insoles absorb sweat and can become quite dirty. Avoid submerging them in water, especially if they have cushioning. Instead, wipe them down. Use a damp cloth moistened with a mild soap solution. Gently wipe both sides of the insole. Pay attention to any visible stains. You can use a soft brush for tougher spots. Make sure not to saturate the insole too much.

After cleaning, always air dry the laces and insoles completely. Lay them flat in a well-ventilated area. Do not place them in direct sunlight. Sunlight can cause discoloration or damage. Allow them to dry fully before putting them back into your shoes. This prevents mildew growth and bad smells. A completely clean lace and insole set brings your whole shoe back to life. This complete cleaning strategy ensures every part of your shoe feels refreshed.

## The Drying Process: A Crucial Step for Your Yeezy 700 V3

After all that hard work cleaning your Yeezy 700 V3, the drying process is critical. Proper drying prevents water damage. It also stops mold or mildew from forming. An incorrect drying method can ruin your shoes. It can alter their shape or cause discoloration. Always follow these simple steps for best results.

First, never put your Yeezy 700 V3 shoes in a washing machine or dryer. The high heat and tumbling action can damage the Primeknit fabric. It can also warp the RPU cage and EVA foam midsole. High heat can melt glues. It can also cause the shoe to shrink. Air drying is the only safe method for these sneakers.

To help maintain the shoe's shape, stuff the inside with clean paper towels. White paper towels are best. Colored paper towels or newspaper can transfer ink to the shoe. The paper towels absorb excess moisture from the inside. Change them out every few hours if they become very damp. This speeds up the drying process.

Place your shoes in a cool, well-ventilated area. A spot indoors away from direct sunlight is ideal. Avoid placing them near radiators or heaters. Direct heat can dry the materials too quickly. This can lead to cracking or stiffening. Air circulation is key for even drying. A fan can help move air around the shoes.

Allow your Yeezys to dry completely. This can take 24 to 48 hours, depending on humidity levels. Do not rush this step. Putting on damp shoes can lead to odors and discomfort. Check inside the shoe to ensure it is fully dry before wearing it. Patience here pays off, ensuring your clean Yeezys last longer. This careful drying process is similar to how you would dry many delicate items. You would apply similar care to other fabrics around your home.

## Yeezy 700 V3 Maintenance Tips for Lasting Cleanliness

Cleaning your Yeezy 700 V3 is a great start. However, consistent maintenance keeps them looking their best over time. A little preventive care goes a long way. It helps reduce the need for deep cleaning. It also protects your investment in these stylish sneakers. Following simple habits ensures your Yeezys stay fresh for longer.

Consider applying a protective spray. Before wearing new or freshly cleaned Yeezys, use a water and stain repellent spray. These sprays create an invisible barrier on the shoe's surface. This barrier helps repel liquids and dirt. It makes future cleaning much easier. Look for sprays safe for Primeknit and synthetic materials. Always follow the product instructions for application.

Spot clean immediately after any spills or dirt. Do not let stains sit. The longer a stain remains, the harder it is to remove. Keep a damp cloth handy. Wipe away any fresh marks as soon as you notice them. This quick action can prevent a small smudge from becoming a permanent stain. It is a simple habit that saves a lot of effort later.

Store your Yeezys properly. When you are not wearing them, keep them in a cool, dry place. Using shoe trees helps maintain their shape. Shoe boxes protect them from dust and light. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight for long periods. UV rays can fade colors and degrade materials. Proper storage reduces exposure to environmental elements.

Make light cleaning a routine. Do not wait for your shoes to get very dirty. A quick wipe down after each wear can prevent grime buildup. Brush off loose dirt every few days. This regular, light maintenance is easier than major cleaning. It also keeps your Yeezy 700 V3 looking sharp and ready to wear. These small steps ensure your shoes remain in excellent condition.
