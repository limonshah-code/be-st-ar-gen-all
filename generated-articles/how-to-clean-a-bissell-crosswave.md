## Master Cleaning Your Bissell Crosswave

Your Bissell Crosswave works hard to keep your floors spotless. It tackles spills, picks up pet hair, and scrubs away grime from multiple surfaces. But what happens when the cleaner itself needs a good cleaning? Keeping your Bissell Crosswave clean is not just about hygiene; it is vital for its performance and lifespan. A dirty Crosswave can leave streaks, harbor odors, and even malfunction.

I know how frustrating it is when a cleaning tool stops working right. Regular cleaning prevents these issues. This guide will walk you through every step of how to clean a Bissell Crosswave. We will cover daily maintenance, weekly deep cleaning, and even troubleshooting common problems. By following these simple instructions, you can ensure your Crosswave always performs its best, leaving your home truly clean.

### Takeaway

To ensure your Bissell Crosswave performs optimally and avoids odors or clogs, daily and weekly cleaning routines are essential.
*   Empty and rinse tanks after each use.
*   Clean the brush roll and brush roll window regularly.
*   Rinse and dry all removable parts thoroughly.
*   Check for and clear clogs in hoses and filters.
*   Perform deep cleaning of all components weekly for long-term maintenance.

A Bissell Crosswave needs regular cleaning of its brush roll, tanks, and filters after each use, plus a weekly deep clean of all removable parts and internal components, to prevent odors, clogs, and maintain optimal performance.

## Understanding Your Bissell Crosswave's Design

Your Bissell Crosswave is a multi-surface floor cleaner. It washes and vacuums floors at the same time. This design means it handles both wet and dry messes. The machine uses clean water and solution from one tank. It collects dirty water and debris in another tank. This dual-tank system is a key feature.

Other important parts include the brush roll. This brush spins to scrub your floors. There is also a brush roll window that covers it. Filters help protect the motor from debris. Hoses and nozzles direct water and suction. Each part plays a role in the cleaning process. Knowing these parts helps you understand where dirt builds up. It also helps you clean your machine effectively.

Regular cleaning prevents clogs and odors. When dirt and dirty water sit in the machine, they can cause problems. Bacteria can grow, leading to bad smells. Clogs reduce suction power and cleaning ability. I find that a little effort after each use saves a lot of trouble later. This section helps you understand what you are cleaning. It prepares you for the specific steps that follow.

## Daily Cleaning Routine for Your Crosswave

Cleaning your Bissell Crosswave after every use is crucial. This step prevents dirt from drying and sticking to parts. It also stops odors from forming inside the machine. This daily routine is simple and takes only a few minutes. I always do this right after finishing my floor cleaning.

First, you need to turn off the machine and unplug it. Safety always comes first. Then, remove the dirty water tank. You will see how much grime it collected. This is often surprising, even after cleaning seemingly clean floors.

Empty the dirty water tank completely. Rinse it with clean, warm water. Make sure to rinse the inside thoroughly. You can use a mild soap if needed, but water often does the job. Let the tank air dry completely before putting it back. This prevents mildew and odors.

Next, remove the brush roll and the brush roll window. These parts get very dirty. You can rinse them under running water. Use a soft brush to remove any hair or debris stuck on the brush roll. Pay close attention to the bristles. They pick up a lot of gunk.

Place the brush roll and brush roll window in the drying tray. Many Crosswave models come with this tray. Let them air dry completely. This step is important for preventing mildew. Never store wet components inside the machine. Wet parts can cause bad smells and damage the machine over time. By doing these steps daily, your Crosswave stays fresh. It will always be ready for the next cleaning task.

### Steps for Daily Maintenance

*   **Turn Off and Unplug:** Always start by ensuring the machine is off and unplugged from the power outlet.
*   **Empty and Rinse Dirty Water Tank:** Remove the dirty water tank. Pour out the contents. Rinse the tank thoroughly with clean, warm water. Let it air dry.
*   **Remove and Clean Brush Roll and Window:** Open the brush roll window. Take out the brush roll. Rinse both parts under running water. Remove any hair or debris by hand or with a brush.
*   **Dry Components:** Place the brush roll and window in the drying tray. Allow them to air dry completely.
*   **Wipe Exterior:** Use a damp cloth to wipe down the exterior of the machine. Remove any spills or dirt.

## Weekly Deep Clean of Crosswave Components

While daily cleaning keeps your Bissell Crosswave fresh, a weekly deep clean is essential. This routine tackles hidden dirt and prevents long-term issues. It ensures all components are free from debris. This deep cleaning helps maintain the suction power and overall effectiveness of your machine. I find that dedicating time once a week for this keeps my Crosswave running like new.

Start by checking the filter. Your Crosswave has a filter, often located near the dirty water tank. This filter collects fine dust and debris. A clogged filter reduces suction and can strain the motor. Remove the filter and tap it gently over a trash can to remove loose dirt. If it is washable, rinse it under running water until clean. Let it air dry for at least 24 hours. A damp filter can damage the motor.

Next, inspect the dirty water tank basin. This is the area where the dirty water tank sits. Debris can accumulate here. Use a damp cloth to wipe out any residue. Sometimes, pet hair or larger particles get stuck. Make sure this area is clean before putting the tank back.

The brush roll chamber also needs attention. After removing the brush roll and window, inspect the inside of the chamber. You might find stubborn grime or hair wrapped around parts. Use a damp cloth or a small brush to clean these areas. Ensure no hair or debris remains. This ensures the brush roll spins freely.

Consider disassembling other accessible parts, if your model allows. Some Crosswave models have easily removable nozzles or suction paths. Consult your user manual for specific instructions on disassembling your particular model for cleaning. Cleaning these parts ensures no blockages. This step is vital for preventing odors and maintaining strong suction.

### Detailed Steps for Weekly Deep Clean

#### Cleaning the Filter

*   **Locate Filter:** The filter is usually located near or on the dirty water tank.
*   **Remove and Clean:** Take out the filter. Tap it against a trash can to remove loose debris.
*   **Rinse (if washable):** If your filter is washable, rinse it under cool water until the water runs clear.
*   **Dry Completely:** Allow the filter to air dry for at least 24 hours. A completely dry filter is critical for machine function. Do not put it back wet.

#### Cleaning the Dirty Water Tank Basin

*   **Inspect Basin:** After removing the dirty water tank, look into the basin area where it sits.
*   **Wipe Down:** Use a damp cloth to wipe away any residue, dirt, or hair that may have accumulated in the basin.

#### Cleaning the Brush Roll Chamber

*   **Access Chamber:** With the brush roll and window removed, inspect the entire brush roll chamber.
*   **Remove Debris:** Use a damp cloth or a small cleaning brush to remove any stuck-on grime, hair, or debris from inside the chamber. Pay attention to the areas where the brush roll spins.

#### Checking and Cleaning the Nozzle/Suction Path

*   **Inspect Nozzle:** Some Crosswave models have a removable nozzle cover or a clear suction path that can get clogged.
*   **Clear Blockages:** If accessible, check for any blockages in the nozzle or suction path. Use a small tool or brush to clear any obstructions. Refer to your manual for specific disassembly if needed.

## Deeper Dive: Cleaning the Crosswave's Internal Parts

Sometimes, a basic clean is not enough. Your Bissell Crosswave has internal parts that can accumulate dirt and grime over time. These parts are not always easy to access. However, cleaning them can greatly improve your machine's performance. It also helps in preventing those stubborn odors. I suggest doing this deeper dive once a month or if you notice performance issues.

One common area for hidden build-up is the hose or suction channel. This is the path dirty water travels from the floor to the dirty water tank. Residue can cling to the inside of this hose. This can restrict airflow and suction. To clean it, you can run clean water through the machine without the brush roll. Some users also carefully use a bottle brush to clear blockages, but this requires caution to avoid damaging the internal components. Always consult your manual first.

The internal components near the motor usually do not need direct cleaning. They are typically sealed off. However, ensuring that the filter is always clean is the best way to protect these parts. A clean filter keeps debris from reaching the motor. This protects your investment.

Pay attention to the areas around the clean water tank. While the tank itself is for clean water, sometimes water can splash or leak. This creates damp spots where mold or mildew might grow. Wipe down the entire housing of the machine, especially under and around the tanks. Use a mild disinfectant if you suspect mold. Make sure to dry these areas completely.

If your Crosswave has specific pet features, like a separate strainer for pet hair, make sure to clean those thoroughly. Pet hair is notorious for causing clogs and odors. Many Bissell pet cleaners have similar features. You can get more insights from this article on [how to clean a Bissell pet carpet cleaner](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-bissell-pet-carpet-cleaner). By addressing these internal areas, you ensure a complete clean. This helps your Crosswave function at its peak, providing truly clean floors.

### Steps for Internal Cleaning

#### Cleaning the Suction Channel/Hose

*   **Run Clean Water:** Fill the clean water tank with plain water. Run the machine for a minute with the brush roll removed. This flushes the suction path.
*   **Check for Blockages:** If suction is low, check for visible clogs in the suction channel. Some models allow careful access with a soft brush, but be gentle.

#### Cleaning Around Internal Compartments

*   **Wipe Housing:** Use a damp cloth to wipe the inside of the machine's housing. Pay attention to areas where tanks sit.
*   **Check for Residue:** Look for any build-up or residue that might have dripped from the tanks. Clean these spots immediately.

#### Inspecting Pet-Specific Features (if applicable)

*   **Clean Hair Strainer:** If your Crosswave has a pet hair strainer, remove and clean it thoroughly. Pet hair can quickly cause clogs and odors.
*   **Rinse All Parts:** Rinse any other removable pet-specific attachments or internal components according to your manual.

## Addressing Common Crosswave Cleaning Issues

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter specific problems with your Bissell Crosswave. Knowing how to address these common issues helps keep your machine in top shape. It also prevents small problems from becoming bigger, more expensive ones. I have dealt with these issues myself, so I know how frustrating they can be.

One of the most frequent complaints is a bad odor coming from the machine. This usually happens when dirty water or debris is left to sit. Mold and bacteria grow in damp, dirty environments. To combat this, ensure you always empty and rinse the dirty water tank immediately after use. Deep clean the brush roll, filter, and brush roll chamber weekly. Running a small amount of Bissell's Multi-Surface Pet with Febreze formula through the machine with clean water can also help neutralize odors. Make sure to air dry all components completely.

Another common issue is reduced suction or streaking. Reduced suction often points to a clog. Check the brush roll for wrapped hair or debris. Inspect the filter; a clogged filter is a primary cause of low suction. Also, check the suction channel or hose for blockages. Streaking often means the brush roll is dirty or the solution tank is empty. Ensure your clean water tank has enough formula and the brush roll is clean and spinning freely.

Sometimes, the machine might leak. Leaks usually stem from improperly seated tanks or seals. Check that both the clean and dirty water tanks are securely in place. Inspect their rubber gaskets for cracks or damage. A damaged gasket might need replacement. Never use a machine that is actively leaking water. This can cause electrical hazards.

Finally, some users report the brush roll not spinning. This could be due to tangled hair, a foreign object jammed in the brush roll area, or a worn-out belt (though less common in Crosswaves). Always check for blockages first. If the problem persists after clearing debris, it might indicate a mechanical issue. For general troubleshooting on various Bissell models, looking at how other machines are maintained can provide insights, for example, on a [Bissell Revolution Pet Pro](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-revolution-pet-pro) or even a [Bissell ProHeat Pet Turbo](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-proheat-pet-turbo). Addressing these problems quickly ensures your Crosswave continues to deliver excellent cleaning results.

### Solutions for Common Problems

#### Odors

*   **Immediate Action:** Always empty and thoroughly rinse the dirty water tank after every single use.
*   **Deep Clean:** Perform weekly deep cleans of the brush roll, filter, and brush roll chamber.
*   **Air Dry:** Ensure all removable parts dry completely before reassembly to prevent mold and mildew.
*   **Deodorizing Solution:** Run clean water mixed with a small amount of Bissell cleaning formula designed to neutralize odors through the machine.

#### Reduced Suction or Streaking

*   **Check for Clogs:** Inspect the brush roll, filter, and suction channel for any blockages. Remove all hair, debris, or foreign objects.
*   **Clean Filter:** Ensure the filter is clean and completely dry. A clogged or wet filter drastically reduces suction.
*   **Verify Solution:** Make sure the clean water tank has sufficient cleaning formula. Streaking can occur if the brush roll runs dry.
*   **Clean Brush Roll:** Ensure the brush roll is free of debris and spins without obstruction.

#### Leaks

*   **Check Tank Seating:** Make sure both the clean and dirty water tanks are properly seated and locked into place.
*   **Inspect Seals:** Examine the rubber gaskets and seals on both tanks for any signs of wear, cracks, or damage. Replace if necessary.
*   **Avoid Overfilling:** Do not overfill the clean water tank beyond the "max fill" line.

#### Brush Roll Not Spinning

*   **Remove Obstructions:** Check the brush roll and its chamber for hair, strings, or other debris wrapped around it. Clear any blockages.
*   **Inspect Belt:** While less common for user repair, if no visible blockages exist, the drive belt may be damaged. This often requires professional service.

## Maintaining Your Crosswave for Long-Term Performance

Proper cleaning extends the life of your Bissell Crosswave. But maintenance goes beyond just cleaning. It involves regular checks and knowing when to replace parts. This proactive approach saves you money in the long run. It also ensures your cleaner is always ready for action. I always check these things to get the most out of my appliances.

First, routinely inspect the brush roll. Over time, bristles can wear down, especially with heavy use. Worn bristles become less effective at scrubbing floors. If your brush roll looks matted or damaged, it is time for a replacement. Bissell offers various brush rolls for different floor types, like hard floors or area rugs. Using the correct brush roll for your cleaning task also prolongs its life and improves cleaning performance.

Filters also need attention. While cleaning your filter extends its life, filters do not last forever. After several months of use, or if you notice a persistent reduction in suction despite cleaning, replace your filter. A fresh filter improves air circulation and protects the motor. Always use genuine Bissell replacement filters. Non-genuine filters might not fit correctly or offer the same level of filtration.

Check the clean and dirty water tanks for signs of wear. Look for cracks or weak spots. Pay close attention to the rubber seals and gaskets on these tanks. If they become brittle or crack, they can cause leaks. Replacing a damaged tank or seal is much cheaper than buying a whole new machine.

Finally, store your Crosswave properly. After cleaning and drying all parts, reassemble the machine. Store it in a dry, temperate place. Avoid extreme temperatures, as this can affect plastic components and seals. Keeping it in a clean, dust-free environment helps maintain its external appearance and internal components. By following these maintenance tips, your Bissell Crosswave will serve you well for years to come.

### Key Maintenance Practices

#### Brush Roll Inspection and Replacement

*   **Regular Check:** Routinely inspect the brush roll for wear, matted bristles, or damage.
*   **Replace When Worn:** Replace the brush roll if bristles are significantly worn or if cleaning effectiveness decreases. This improves scrubbing power.
*   **Use Correct Type:** Ensure you are using the correct brush roll for your specific floor type (e.g., multi-surface, wood floor, pet).

#### Filter Replacement

*   **Monitor Performance:** If suction decreases despite cleaning the filter, it may be time to replace it.
*   **Scheduled Replacement:** Replace filters every 3-6 months depending on usage, or as recommended by Bissell.
*   **Genuine Parts:** Always use genuine Bissell replacement filters for optimal performance and fit.

#### Tank and Seal Inspection

*   **Check for Damage:** Regularly inspect both the clean and dirty water tanks for cracks or signs of wear.
*   **Examine Gaskets:** Pay close attention to the rubber seals and gaskets on the tanks. Replace them if they appear brittle, cracked, or are causing leaks.

#### Proper Storage

*   **Clean and Dry:** Ensure all components are clean and completely dry before storing the machine.
*   **Climate Control:** Store your Crosswave in a dry, temperate environment. Avoid extreme heat or cold which can damage plastic and rubber parts.
*   **Upright Position:** Store the machine upright and in a secure location where it will not tip over.
