### Understanding Your Hunter SRC Plus Controller

The Hunter SRC Plus is a popular residential irrigation controller. It helps automate watering schedules for your lawn and garden. This controller is known for its user-friendly interface and reliable performance. However, like any electronic device, it can face issues over time. Understanding its basic functions helps with **Hunter SRC Plus troubleshooting**.

The SRC Plus connects to your home's power supply. It sends low-voltage signals to control irrigation valves. Each valve corresponds to a specific watering zone. The controller also manages start times, run times, and watering days. Some models also connect to rain sensors. These sensors prevent unnecessary watering during rainfall. Knowing these components will help you pinpoint problems faster. A functional controller ensures your landscape gets the right amount of water. This saves water and promotes healthy plant growth.

When your Hunter SRC Plus does not work right, consider its parts. The display shows programs and current status. Buttons help you set schedules. Terminal strips connect to zone wires and the common wire. A transformer provides the necessary power. The backup battery saves your settings during power outages. If any of these parts fail, your system can stop working. We will look at common issues with each of these components next. This knowledge is key to effective diagnostics.

Regularly checking your controller helps prevent big problems. Look for loose wires or unusual sounds. Ensure the display is clear and responsive. Small issues can become larger failures if ignored. Proactive checks save you time and money. I find that quick checks often catch problems early. This keeps my system running smoothly.

### Diagnosing Hunter SRC Plus Power and Display Issues

Power problems are often the first sign of trouble with your Hunter SRC Plus. If the display is blank or shows no signs of life, start here. First, check the power outlet. Ensure the outlet has power by plugging in another device. Sometimes, a tripped circuit breaker is the simple answer. Reset the breaker if it is off. This step is easy but often overlooked.

Next, inspect the controller's transformer. The transformer typically plugs into an outlet and connects to the controller. Look for any visible damage to the transformer body or its wires. Use a multimeter to test the transformer's output voltage. The SRC Plus requires 24 VAC. If the reading is zero or significantly off, the transformer is faulty. A bad transformer needs replacement. Hunter controllers are generally resilient, but their power components can fail.

If the transformer checks out, look at the internal wiring inside the controller. Make sure the transformer wires are securely connected to the correct terminals. Sometimes, a loose connection can stop power from reaching the display. Gently tighten any screws on the terminal strip. A blank display can also mean a blown internal fuse on some older models. Consult your user manual to see if your model has a replaceable fuse.

A partial or dim display indicates a power issue or an aging LCD. If some segments of the display are missing, the LCD itself might be failing. This usually requires replacing the controller. If the display is dim but present, check the backup battery. A weak battery might not directly affect the main display during normal operation, but it can cause odd behavior. Replace the battery with a fresh one. This ensures settings are saved during power interruptions and can sometimes resolve minor display glitches. Proper power is critical for all controller functions. Without it, no amount of programming will make your sprinklers work.

### Troubleshooting Hunter SRC Plus Zone and Valve Problems

Zone and valve issues are common for sprinkler systems. If a specific zone does not turn on, or if it stays on, you have a valve problem. Start by manually trying to activate the zone from the controller. Does the controller click? This click indicates the controller is sending a signal. If it clicks, the problem is likely at the valve or its wiring.

First, check the wiring to the affected valve. Wires can be cut by garden tools or damaged by rodents. Dig carefully around the valve box to expose the wiring. Look for frayed insulation or breaks in the wire. Each valve has two wires: one common wire and one zone wire. Ensure both are intact and properly connected. Use waterproof wire connectors for all outdoor splices. A bad splice allows water into the connection, causing corrosion and failure.

Next, test the solenoid on the valve. The solenoid is the electrical component that opens and closes the valve. Disconnect the two wires from the solenoid. Use a multimeter to measure the resistance across the solenoid's two terminals. A good solenoid typically reads between 20-60 ohms. A reading of zero ohms (short circuit) or infinite ohms (open circuit) means the solenoid is bad. You can also temporarily connect a 24 VAC transformer directly to the solenoid wires. If the valve clicks open, the solenoid is working, and the problem is with the controller or wiring. If it does not click, replace the solenoid.

If multiple zones are not working, the common wire is often the culprit. The common wire connects to every valve in your system. A break in the common wire will prevent all downstream valves from working. Trace the common wire from the controller through your yard. Look for any cuts or bad splices. A damaged common wire can be tricky to find but is a frequent cause of widespread zone failure. For more insights into controller specific zone issues, you might find similarities in [Hunter X-Core troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/hunter-x-core-troubleshooting). Sometimes, debris gets stuck inside the valve. Turn off the main water supply to the sprinklers. Then, carefully open the valve body to clear any dirt or small stones. Always flush the system after any valve maintenance.

### Resolving Hunter SRC Plus Programming and Scheduling Errors

Programming mistakes can lead to unexpected watering behavior. Your Hunter SRC Plus controller relies on accurate settings to water effectively. If your zones are watering at the wrong times, for incorrect durations, or not at all, review your programming. This is a common area for user error, but it is easy to fix.

First, check the start times. Ensure your programs are set to begin at the desired times. The SRC Plus supports multiple start times per day. Make sure you have not inadvertently set an extra start time. Verify the AM/PM setting is correct. A simple mistake here can cause watering in the middle of the night or day. Next, confirm the run times for each zone. Each zone should have its specific duration set. Too short, and your plants get dry. Too long, and you waste water.

Then, examine your watering days. The SRC Plus lets you choose specific days of the week, odd/even days, or interval watering. Double-check that your selected watering days match your needs. If you selected odd days, for example, but wanted specific days, your system will not water as expected. Make sure no "off" days are accidentally selected for all programs. Conflicts between programs can also occur. If you have multiple programs, ensure their start times do not overlap excessively. The controller prioritizes programs in a certain order, and overlapping can lead to some zones skipping or cutting short.

The seasonal adjust feature also affects watering. This feature allows you to scale all run times up or down by a percentage. If it is set to 0% or a very low number, your zones will not run or run very briefly. Always ensure this setting is appropriate for the current season. If your controller has a rain sensor input, ensure the sensor is not preventing watering. A faulty rain sensor can signal "rain" even when it is dry. This stops all scheduled watering. You can temporarily bypass the rain sensor to test if it is the problem. Your manual explains how to do this. Understanding these settings is vital. Many problems stem from a simple incorrect button press.

For issues with an unresponsive or "locked up" controller, a factory reset can clear programming glitches. This wipes all current settings and returns the controller to its default state. You will need to re-enter all your programs after a reset. However, it often resolves unexplained programming bugs. Consult your Hunter SRC Plus manual for specific reset instructions. Usually, it involves holding down certain buttons or removing the battery for a short period. This can sometimes resolve issues that seem more significant than simple programming errors, much like resolving problems in a [Hunter Pro-C troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/hunter-pro-c-troubleshooting) scenario.

### Addressing Hunter SRC Plus Wiring and Sensor Malfunctions

Proper wiring is critical for your Hunter SRC Plus. Incorrect or damaged wiring causes many irrigation system problems. Always turn off power to the controller before checking any wiring. Safety first! Start by inspecting the main power connection. Ensure the transformer wires are firmly in the correct terminals on the controller. Loose connections here can cause intermittent power issues or no power at all.

Next, examine the common wire. The common wire usually connects to the "C" or "Common" terminal on the controller. This wire connects to one lead of every solenoid in your system. A break in this single wire can stop all zones from working. Trace this wire from the controller out into your yard and through valve boxes. Look for any visible damage, cuts, or corrosion at splices. Faulty wire connectors that allow water in are common points of failure. Replace any suspect connections with waterproof connectors.

Each zone has its dedicated wire, connected to a numbered terminal on the controller. Check each zone wire for secure connection. Pull gently on each wire to ensure it is not loose. If a specific zone is not working, check its dedicated wire first. A short circuit in any zone wire can also prevent that zone from operating. You can test for shorts using a multimeter. Disconnect all zone wires from the controller, then check resistance between each zone wire and the common wire. An abnormally low reading (near zero ohms) could indicate a short.

Rain sensors are excellent tools but can also cause issues. The Hunter SRC Plus connects to various sensor types. If your system is not watering despite dry conditions, your rain sensor might be stuck. Physically check the sensor. Is it full of water or debris? Clean it if necessary. Most rain sensors have a bypass switch. You can flip this switch to temporarily deactivate the sensor. If your system then waters normally, the sensor is the problem. You can then clean it, adjust its sensitivity, or replace it. For example, similar sensor issues can impact a [Hunter I-Core troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/hunter-i-core-troubleshooting) process.

Finally, consider the master valve if your system has one. A master valve opens when any zone turns on, providing water to the system. If the master valve fails, no zones will get water. Check its wiring and solenoid, similar to how you would test a zone valve. The master valve wire connects to a dedicated "MV" or "P/MV" terminal on your SRC Plus. Ensure this connection is solid. A faulty master valve can mimic a common wire problem, affecting the entire system.

### Fixing Water Pressure and Flow Issues with Hunter SRC Plus

While the Hunter SRC Plus controller manages signals, water pressure and flow issues affect how sprinklers actually perform. The controller does not directly control water pressure. However, problems with water delivery can appear as controller malfunctions. If your sprinklers are not popping up fully, or if they have weak streams, low water pressure is likely the cause.

First, check your main water supply. Ensure the main water valve to your irrigation system is fully open. Sometimes, people partially close this valve, leading to reduced pressure. Also, check your backflow prevention device. If it is partially closed or malfunctioning, it can restrict water flow. Some backflow devices have shut-off valves that might be partially closed. Open them fully. If the backflow device itself is leaking or looks damaged, it might need professional repair or replacement.

Next, inspect the main line and lateral lines for leaks. Leaks in the system, especially underground, can significantly drop pressure. Look for soggy spots in your lawn or areas where water pools. Even small leaks can waste water and reduce pressure to the sprinkler heads. Repair any identified leaks promptly. This restores pressure and saves water. Sprinkler heads themselves can also cause flow issues. Check for clogged nozzles or broken heads. Debris like dirt, sand, or mineral deposits can block nozzles. Clean or replace any clogged or damaged heads. A simple cleaning can often restore proper spray patterns.

If your system uses a pressure regulator, check its setting. Some systems have a pressure regulator after the main water line connection. This device controls the maximum pressure to your irrigation system. If it is set too low or is faulty, it will restrict pressure. Consult your system's design or a professional to determine the correct pressure setting. Adjust or replace the regulator as needed.

Finally, consider the capacity of your water meter. If your system's demand exceeds the water meter's flow rate, you will experience low pressure. This is more common in large systems with many zones running simultaneously. You might need to adjust your programming to run fewer zones at a time. This reduces the immediate demand on your water supply. Ensuring good water pressure and flow optimizes your SRC Plus's efforts. The controller can tell the valves to open, but only adequate pressure pushes the water where it needs to go.

### Performing a Hunter SRC Plus Reset and Preventative Maintenance

Sometimes, the quickest solution for an erratic Hunter SRC Plus is a reset. A factory reset will erase all your programmed settings. However, it can clear glitches or persistent software bugs. To perform a factory reset, you usually need to remove the backup battery and unplug the controller from power. Wait a few minutes, then reconnect the power and reinsert the battery. Some models might have a specific reset button or button combination. Consult your SRC Plus user manual for the exact steps for your model. After a reset, you will need to reprogram all your watering schedules.

Preventative maintenance is crucial for the longevity of your Hunter SRC Plus. Simple checks can prevent major problems. First, check the backup battery annually. This battery preserves your programming during power outages. A dead battery means you will lose all settings if power is interrupted. Replace it with a fresh 9-volt alkaline battery. This is a small cost for great peace of mind.

Regularly inspect your controller's enclosure. Ensure the door latches securely. This keeps moisture, dust, and insects out. If the enclosure is damaged, water can get in and short out the electronics. Consider placing the controller in a sheltered location, away from direct sunlight or harsh weather. Extreme temperatures can also degrade electronic components over time.

Before winter, if you live in a freezing climate, ensure you properly winterize your irrigation system. This includes shutting off the main water supply and draining all lines. While the controller itself might be rated for outdoor use, extreme cold can still affect its lifespan. Some people choose to remove the controller for winter storage indoors. Reinstall it once the threat of frost passes.

Throughout the watering season, periodically check your system. Observe your sprinklers when they run. Are all zones activating? Are heads spraying properly? Do you see any leaks? Early detection of small issues saves big repair costs. Also, keep the area around your controller clean. Do not let dust, spiderwebs, or debris accumulate inside. A clean controller runs cooler and lasts longer. Following these simple maintenance steps will significantly extend the life of your Hunter SRC Plus. It also minimizes future troubleshooting headaches.

### Common Hunter SRC Plus Error Codes and Meanings

Your Hunter SRC Plus controller may display error codes. These codes provide clues about what is wrong with the system. Knowing what each code means speeds up your troubleshooting. When you see an "ERR" message, it usually points to a specific problem area.

One common error is an "Err" message followed by a zone number. For example, "Err 3" means there is a problem with zone 3. This typically indicates a short circuit in the wiring for that zone. A short can happen if the zone wire touches the common wire, or if the wire insulation is damaged and touching metal. To fix this, disconnect the wire for the affected zone at the controller. If the error clears, the problem is in the field wiring or the solenoid for that specific zone. You will need to inspect the wiring and test the solenoid as discussed earlier.

Sometimes, the display might show a general "Error" or "System Error" message without a specific zone number. This can point to an internal controller issue. It might also indicate a problem with the master valve or pump start circuit if your system uses one. In these cases, first try a controller reset. A reset can often clear internal software glitches. If the error persists, it might suggest a faulty controller board. In this scenario, replacing the controller might be necessary.

Another less common issue is a "No AC" error or similar indicator. This means the controller is not receiving proper AC power from the transformer. This could be due to a disconnected transformer, a tripped circuit breaker, or a faulty transformer. Always check your power source first when you see such a message.

Finally, some controllers might show issues related to sensor input. If your rain sensor is faulty or miscalibrated, it might trigger an error or prevent watering without an explicit code. The controller might simply display "Sensor Active" or similar, even when it is dry. If you suspect your sensor, try bypassing it as described in your user manual. Always refer to your Hunter SRC Plus manual for a complete list of error codes and their specific troubleshooting steps. Each model might have slight variations in error indicators. Understanding these messages is a shortcut to diagnosing and fixing your system.
