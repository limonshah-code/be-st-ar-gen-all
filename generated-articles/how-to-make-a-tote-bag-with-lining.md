## How To Make A Tote Bag With Lining: A Complete Guide

Have you ever wanted to carry a bag that you made yourself? A homemade tote bag feels special. Adding a lining makes it stronger and gives it a nice finish. This project is a great way to use your sewing machine. It also lets you express your personal style.

Making a tote bag with lining might seem hard. It is a simple process. We will walk you through each step. You will learn about choosing fabrics and sewing each piece. Soon, you will have a beautiful, durable bag. This guide helps you create a useful and pretty tote bag.

### Takeaway:
*   Gather all your sewing supplies before you start.
*   Choose durable and appealing fabrics for both the outer bag and the lining.
*   Cut your fabric pieces accurately to ensure a well-shaped bag.
*   Sew the outer bag and the lining separately before joining them.
*   Add pockets or embellishments to personalize your tote bag.

Making a tote bag with lining involves simple sewing steps. You cut fabric for the outer bag and a separate piece for the lining. Then, you sew these parts together. This process creates a sturdy, finished bag. It protects your items and gives a neat look.

### Why Make a Lined Tote Bag? Understanding the Benefits

A simple tote bag is good, but a lined tote bag is much better. It adds strength to your bag. The lining gives the bag more body. This means your bag holds its shape well. It does not flop over when you set it down.

The lining also protects the main fabric. Think about daily wear and tear. Your keys or other items can rub against the inside. A lining takes this wear. It keeps the outer fabric looking new for longer. This also makes the bag easier to clean inside.

A lined bag looks more professional. The seams are hidden. This gives a very neat and tidy appearance. It shows careful workmanship. It feels good to carry something you made with such attention to detail.

Adding pockets is simple with a lining. You can sew pockets directly onto the lining fabric. This keeps your phone, wallet, or pens organized. A lined tote bag becomes more functional. It is not just a simple pouch.

### Essential Supplies for Sewing a Lined Tote Bag

Before you begin sewing, gather all your tools. Having everything ready makes the process smooth. You will need a sewing machine that works well. A basic machine is enough for this project. Make sure it has common stitch settings.

You need good sewing scissors. Fabric scissors cut cleanly. Using them only for fabric keeps them sharp. A measuring tape or ruler is also important. This helps you get accurate cuts. Accuracy is key for a good-looking bag.

Sewing pins hold fabric pieces together. They stop the fabric from shifting as you sew. Fabric clips also work well, especially for thicker fabrics. You will need a fabric marker or tailor's chalk. This helps you draw cutting lines.

Thread is essential. Choose a strong polyester thread. Match its color to your fabric. A seam ripper is a must-have tool. Everyone makes mistakes, and a seam ripper helps you fix them easily. An iron and ironing board are useful for pressing seams flat. Pressing makes your bag look crisp and professional.

### Selecting Your Fabrics: Outer Shell and Lining Choices

Choosing your fabric is a fun part of making a tote bag. The outer fabric should be strong. Canvas, denim, or heavy cotton twill work well. These fabrics can withstand daily use. They also hold their shape. Think about the bag's purpose. Will it carry heavy books or light groceries?

For the lining, you can choose a lighter fabric. Cotton poplin or quilting cotton is good. These fabrics are easy to sew. They come in many patterns and colors. You can pick a fun print for the lining. This adds a surprise element inside your bag. A contrasting color also looks great.

Consider how the fabrics work together. The outer fabric can be a solid color. Then, the lining can be a bold pattern. Or, you can use a patterned outer fabric and a solid lining. Make sure both fabrics are pre-shrunk. Wash and dry them before cutting. This stops the bag from shrinking later.

You might also think about fabric care. Some fabrics are easy to clean. Canvas is very durable. If your bag gets dirty often, easy-care fabrics are a good idea. Knowing how to care for your fabric helps keep your bag looking good.

This information helps your finished tote bag last longer.

### Preparing Your Pattern Pieces: Accurate Cutting for Success

Getting your fabric pieces cut right is very important. This ensures your tote bag comes together perfectly. First, decide on your bag's size. A standard tote bag might be 16 inches wide by 14 inches tall. Add seam allowances to your measurements. A common seam allowance is 1/2 inch or 5/8 inch.

You will cut two main body pieces for the outer bag. Cut two more for the lining. These pieces should be the same size. For the handles, you will cut two long strips of fabric. The length depends on how you want to carry your bag. Shoulder straps are longer than hand straps.

Lay your fabric flat and smooth. Use your measuring tape and fabric marker to draw clear lines. Cut along these lines carefully with your sharp fabric scissors. Take your time. Precise cuts lead to precise seams. This makes sewing much easier.

If you want pockets, cut fabric pieces for those now too. A simple patch pocket is easy to add. Decide on its size and placement. Ironing your fabric before cutting also helps. It removes wrinkles. Flat fabric is easier to measure and cut accurately.

### Sewing the Outer Tote Bag Body and Handles

Now you start to sew the main part of your bag. Take your two outer fabric pieces. Place them right sides together. This means the side you want to see on the outside of the bag faces inward. Pin along the bottom and side edges. Leave the top edge open.

Sew these three pinned edges using your chosen seam allowance. Remember to backstitch at the beginning and end of each seam. This locks the stitches in place. It stops them from coming undone. After sewing, press your seams open. This makes the bag lay flat.

Next, create the box corners. This gives your tote bag depth. Fold each bottom corner so the side seam meets the bottom seam. This forms a triangle. Measure about 1.5 to 2 inches from the point of the triangle. Draw a line across. Sew along this line. Trim the excess fabric, leaving about a 1/2 inch seam allowance. Repeat for the other bottom corner.

For the handles, take your two long fabric strips. Fold each strip in half lengthwise, right sides together. Sew along the long raw edge. Turn the tubes right side out. Press them flat. Topstitch along both long edges. This gives the handles a finished look and adds strength. Attach the handles to the top edge of the outer bag. Place them evenly from the sides. Baste them in place. This holds them securely while you add the lining. This ensures your bag is ready for use, and a well-made bag is easier to keep clean. Knowing [how to clean a tote bag](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-tote-bag) will help maintain its appearance over time.

### Crafting the Inner Lining for Your Tote Bag

The lining is the hidden strength of your tote bag. It also gives you a chance to add pockets. Take your two lining fabric pieces. If you want a pocket, sew it onto one lining piece now. Fold the top edge of your pocket piece down. Stitch it. Then fold the other three edges. Place the pocket where you want it on the lining piece. Stitch around the three folded edges. Leave the top open.

With the pocket added, place your two lining pieces right sides together. Pin along the bottom and side edges, just like the outer bag. Sew these three seams using the same seam allowance. Remember to backstitch. Press the seams open.

Create the box corners for the lining. This is the same method you used for the outer bag. Fold each bottom corner. Match the seams. Draw a line and sew across it. Trim the excess fabric. Having box corners on both the outer bag and the lining helps them fit together perfectly.

Now, take your finished lining. Leave it wrong side out. This means the seams are on the outside. This is important for the next step. The lining should now look like a bag with no top. Making the lining well ensures your bag's interior stays tidy. A clean lining is important, and you might wonder [how to clean purse lining](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-purse-lining) if it gets dirty. Preparing it correctly makes future cleaning easier.

### Bringing It All Together: Attaching the Lining to the Outer Bag

This is where your tote bag starts to look complete. Take your outer bag. It should be right side out. This means the fabric's pretty side is facing outward. The handles should be basted in place. Take your lining. It should be wrong side out.

Carefully slide the outer bag inside the lining. The right side of the outer bag will touch the right side of the lining. Match the top raw edges of both bags. Align the side seams. Pin all around the top opening. Make sure your handles are tucked down inside the bag, between the outer fabric and the lining. Do not sew over them.

Now, sew around the entire top opening. Use your chosen seam allowance. Leave an opening of about 4-6 inches along one side. This opening is for turning the bag right side out. Backstitch at the start and end of this seam, before and after the opening.

After sewing, trim the seam allowance around the top edge. Clip the curves if any. This helps the seam lay flat. Gently pull the entire bag through the opening you left. It will look a bit messy at first. Keep pulling until the whole bag is right side out. Push out the corners of the bag and the lining. Your tote bag is almost finished.

### Finishing Touches and Customization for Your Handmade Tote

You are now at the final steps of making your lined tote bag. First, you need to close the opening you used for turning. Fold the raw edges of the opening inward. They should match the sewn seam line. Pin this section closed. You can hand-stitch this opening using a ladder stitch. This stitch is almost invisible. Or, you can machine topstitch very close to the edge.

Once the opening is closed, push the lining down into the bag. Smooth it out. You want the lining to sit neatly inside. Press the top edge of the bag with an iron. This makes the top seam crisp. It helps the bag hold its shape.

Now, topstitch around the entire top edge of your bag. This is an important step. It keeps the lining from popping out. It also adds a professional look. Sew about 1/4 inch from the top edge. You can sew a second line of topstitching for extra strength. This also adds a decorative touch.

Think about ways to make your bag unique. You can add more pockets to the lining. Consider a zipper closure across the top. You can also add decorative elements. Think about fabric paint, patches, or embroidery. You can even sew on a small key clip inside. Your handmade tote bag is now ready to use. It is a true reflection of your creativity and effort. Enjoy carrying your new, special bag.
