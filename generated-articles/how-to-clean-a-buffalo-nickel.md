## Unlock the Secrets: How to Clean a Buffalo Nickel Safely

You just found an old Buffalo Nickel. Maybe it was hiding in a forgotten box, or you inherited a small coin collection. The coin looks dull, perhaps even dirty. Your first thought might be, "How do I clean a Buffalo Nickel and make it shine?" This is a common question, and it is a good one to ask. Many people want to restore old coins to their original luster.

However, cleaning a Buffalo Nickel is often a risky business. What seems like a simple task can drastically reduce a coin's value. Collectors and numismatists usually prefer coins with their original "patina," which is the natural toning that develops over time. This article will explain why cleaning is usually not recommended. We will also share safe handling practices if you decide to clean a non-collectible coin. You will learn the best ways to care for your historical treasures.

### Takeaway:

*   **Avoid cleaning valuable Buffalo Nickels:** Cleaning often destroys their historical patina and reduces their collector's value.
*   **Understand coin value:** Only consider cleaning common, low-value coins, never rare or graded ones.
*   **Use distilled water only:** For minor surface dirt, a gentle rinse with distilled water is the safest option.
*   **Never use harsh chemicals or abrasives:** These methods cause irreversible damage like scratches or chemical reactions.
*   **Prioritize proper storage:** Air-tight, non-PVC holders protect coins from future damage and tarnish.

### Concise Answer:

Cleaning a Buffalo Nickel often harms its value. For valuable coins, avoid cleaning altogether to preserve their original patina. If you must remove surface dirt from a common, low-value coin, gently rinse it with distilled water. Never use harsh chemicals, polishes, or abrasive methods.

## Understanding Your Buffalo Nickel: Is Cleaning Necessary?

When you hold a Buffalo Nickel, you hold a piece of American history. These coins circulated from 1913 to 1938. They represent a significant era in our country's past. The coin features a Native American profile on one side and an American bison on the other. This design captures the spirit of the American West.

The metal composition of a Buffalo Nickel is 75% copper and 25% nickel. Over time, this specific alloy reacts with air and moisture. This reaction creates a natural layer on the coin's surface called "patina." Patina gives older coins their distinctive look. It often appears as dark spots or an even brown tone. Many people consider this patina a sign of authenticity and age. It is a part of the coin's story.

### The Patina's Story: Why It Matters

Patina is more than just dirt or discoloration. It is a protective layer. This layer forms slowly over decades. It shows how the coin has aged naturally. For coin collectors, patina is very important. It tells a coin's age and confirms its originality. A coin without its original patina can look unnatural or "skinned." This look decreases its appeal to collectors.

Removing this patina is like erasing history. It makes a coin less desirable. Think of it like an antique piece of furniture. You would not sand away its original finish. This same idea applies to old coins. Patina adds to the coin's character and historical value. Collectors seek out coins that show their age naturally.

### When Cleaning Harms More Than Helps

You might think cleaning will make your Buffalo Nickel look better. In most cases, it does the opposite. Cleaning physically removes the patina. This process can leave tiny scratches on the coin's surface. These scratches might be invisible to the naked eye. However, they show up under magnification. Such damage permanently alters the coin.

This damage significantly reduces the coin's market value. Professional coin graders can easily spot cleaned coins. They give cleaned coins lower grades, or even mark them as "cleaned." A cleaned coin is worth much less than an uncleaned one, even if it has significant wear. I have seen many good coins ruined this way. Always remember this before you try to clean a Buffalo Nickel.

## The Golden Rule of Coin Care: Avoid Cleaning

I often tell people that the best way to clean a valuable coin is not to clean it at all. This might sound strange, but it is true. This rule applies especially to Buffalo Nickels. These coins are popular with collectors. Their value often depends on their original condition. Any attempt to clean them can cause permanent harm. This damage lowers their value significantly.

Coin collectors value originality. They want coins that show their natural aging process. This includes any dirt, grime, or toning acquired over time. These elements tell the coin's story. They prove the coin has not been altered. A clean coin, paradoxically, can be a red flag. It suggests someone has tampered with it.

### Professional Grading and Cleaned Coins

If you ever send a coin for professional grading, this rule becomes even more critical. Grading services examine coins very closely. They use strong magnification. Their experts can easily detect if a coin has been cleaned. They look for specific signs. These signs include fine scratches, dullness, or an unnatural sheen. They also look for altered surface texture.

When a grading service identifies a coin as "cleaned," they mark it. This designation appears on the coin's certification. A "cleaned" label dramatically lowers the coin's grade. It also lowers its market value. A coin that might have been worth hundreds of dollars could become worth only a few dollars. This is a big financial loss for collectors. It shows why you should never try to clean a Buffalo Nickel if it has any collector value.

### Long-Term Value and Preservation

Preserving a coin means keeping it as close to its original state as possible. This includes its natural dirt and toning. Think of your Buffalo Nickel as an artifact. You would not scrub an ancient artifact with soap and water. You would preserve it carefully. Coins are the same. Their long-term value depends on this preservation.

Instead of cleaning, focus on proper storage. Good storage protects coins from further damage. It prevents new dirt or tarnish from forming. This is the real "cleaning" process for a collector. It keeps the coin stable. It ensures its beauty and value last for generations.

## When Cleaning Might Be Considered (For Non-Collectible Coins)

I understand some people might still want to clean a Buffalo Nickel. Perhaps you have a coin with no collector value. It might be a very common date and in poor condition. You might simply want to see the date or design more clearly. In such rare cases, and with extreme caution, you might consider some minimal cleaning. Please be aware that this is still a risk. It can still damage the coin, even if its value is already low.

You must be certain your coin has no collector value. Check its date and mint mark. Research its rarity. Coins like the 1937-D "Three-Legged" Buffalo Nickel or some 1913 issues are highly valuable. You should never clean such coins. Cleaning is only for coins you consider purely as curiosities. These are coins where any further damage does not matter to you.

### Distinguishing Between Collectible and Common Nickels

How do you know if your Buffalo Nickel is valuable? First, look at the date and mint mark. The mint mark is usually a small letter below "FIVE CENTS" on the reverse side. Some dates and mint marks are rarer than others. For example, the 1913-S Type 2 or 1921-S are less common. Check a reputable coin price guide online or in a book. This research is crucial.

Condition also plays a big part. A coin with clear details, even if dirty, holds more value. If your coin is worn smooth, with no clear date or design, its value is likely low. These are the coins that might be candidates for very gentle cleaning. Remember, "cleaning" here means only removing loose surface dirt, not tarnish or patina.

### Basic Handling: A Gentle Touch

If you decide to proceed, handling the coin properly is vital. Always hold coins by their edges. Never touch the faces of the coin with bare fingers. Your skin has oils. These oils can cause new spots or tarnish over time. Use soft cotton gloves for handling. This simple step prevents new damage.

Work on a soft, clean surface. A towel or a cloth mat works well. This prevents the coin from getting scratched if you drop it. Take your time. Do not rush any step. Every action you take could affect the coin's surface. Care and patience are your best tools when dealing with old coins.

## Safe Practices for Removing Surface Dirt (If You Must)

If you have a common Buffalo Nickel and wish to remove *only* loose surface dirt, there is one generally accepted method. This method uses distilled water. It is the least invasive approach. It carries the lowest risk of damage. It will not remove tarnish or patina. Its only purpose is to rinse away loose dust or grit.

Remember, this method is for surface dirt only. It will not make a dark, toned coin shiny. It will not fix heavy corrosion. It simply removes things stuck on the surface. If you see green verdigris (corrosion), do not attempt this method. Verdigris is a sign of irreversible damage. Attempting to clean it can spread the corrosion.

### Distilled Water Soak Method

Here are the steps for using distilled water:

1.  **Gather Supplies:** You will need a small, clean glass or ceramic bowl. You also need pure distilled water. Do not use tap water. Tap water contains minerals and chemicals that can harm coins. You also need a soft, lint-free cloth or paper towel for drying.
2.  **Place the Coin:** Gently place your Buffalo Nickel into the clean bowl.
3.  **Add Distilled Water:** Pour enough distilled water over the coin to fully submerge it.
4.  **Soak (Optional):** For very loose dirt, a short soak might help. Leave the coin submerged for a few minutes. For tougher, but still loose, dirt, you might soak it for several hours, or even a day. Change the water if it becomes cloudy. I have seen some collectors soak coins for a week, changing the water daily. This method lets dirt fall off naturally.
5.  **Gentle Rinse:** After soaking, carefully remove the coin. Hold it by its edges. Gently rinse it under a slow stream of fresh distilled water. Do not rub the coin. Do not use any brushes, even soft ones. The water pressure alone should be enough to dislodge any remaining loose particles.
6.  **Repeat if Needed:** If some loose dirt remains, you can repeat the soak and rinse process. Do not force anything. If the dirt does not come off easily, it is likely part of the coin's patina or stubborn grime. This is when you stop. Further attempts will cause damage.

### Gentle Drying Techniques

Drying the coin properly is as important as the rinsing. Improper drying can leave water spots. Water spots are ugly and can also reduce the coin's appeal.

1.  **Place on Soft Material:** After rinsing, gently place the coin on a clean, soft, lint-free cloth or paper towel.
2.  **Dab Gently:** Take another clean, soft cloth or paper towel. Gently dab the coin to absorb excess water. Do not rub or wipe the coin. Rubbing can scratch the surface. It can also spread any remaining tiny particles of dirt.
3.  **Air Dry Completely:** Once you have removed most of the surface water, let the coin air dry completely. Place it on a clean, dry surface. Ensure good air circulation. It might take an hour or two for the coin to be completely dry. Do not use heat to speed up drying. Heat can damage the coin's surface. Once dry, your coin might look a bit cleaner, but still aged. This is the desired outcome for non-collectible coins.

## Methods to Strictly Avoid When Cleaning Buffalo Nickels

Now that we have covered the only "safe" method (distilled water), let's talk about what *not* to do. Many people mistakenly think common household cleaners or polishing techniques will help. These methods are disastrous for old coins. They cause irreversible damage. I cannot stress this enough: avoid these methods at all costs for any coin you value.

Buffalo Nickels, like most coins, have a delicate surface. Any abrasive action or chemical reaction can ruin them. Once the original surface is damaged, it is impossible to restore it. This means the coin's historical integrity and often its monetary value are gone forever.

### The Dangers of Abrasive Cleaning

Abrasive cleaning involves rubbing or scrubbing the coin. This includes using polishing cloths, erasers, baking soda paste, or even your shirt sleeve. All these actions cause micro-scratches on the coin's surface. These scratches might not be visible immediately. Under magnification, however, they are very obvious. They give the coin an unnatural, dull appearance.

*   **Polishing Cloths:** These cloths have fine abrasives. They are designed to make metal shiny. For a coin, this means stripping away the patina and leaving a harsh, unnatural luster.
*   **Erasers:** An eraser, even a soft one, works by abrading the surface. It will remove dirt, but also the top layer of the coin. This damages the details and creates an unappealing finish.
*   **Baking Soda Paste:** Baking soda is a mild abrasive. When mixed with water to form a paste, it acts like sandpaper on the coin's delicate surface. It will scratch and dull the coin.
*   **Metal Brushes or Steel Wool:** This should be obvious, but some people try it. These items are extremely abrasive. They will completely destroy the coin's surface.

### Chemical Reactions: A Silent Killer

Many household cleaners contain strong chemicals. These chemicals can react with the metal in your Buffalo Nickel. This reaction can cause permanent discoloration or surface damage. The effects might not show up right away. Over time, strange spots or an unnatural sheen can develop.

*   **Acids (Vinegar, Lemon Juice, Ketchup):** Acids are very common "cleaning" remedies people try. They will dissolve the surface layer of the coin. This removes tarnish, but also leaves the coin looking dull and unnatural. It creates a "pickled" look. Once acid touches a coin, the damage is irreversible.
*   **Bleach:** Bleach is a powerful oxidizer. It can cause severe pitting and discoloration on coin surfaces. Never use bleach on any metal, especially coins.
*   **Commercial Metal Cleaners/Polishes:** These products are made for general metal cleaning, not coins. They contain strong chemicals and abrasives. They will strip the coin's surface and leave it looking unnatural. They often leave a residue that can cause long-term damage. For example, cleaning polished nickel faucets is a different process entirely: [how to clean polished nickel](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-polished-nickel). The methods are not interchangeable. Similarly, cleaning nickel plating requires different approaches: [how to clean nickel plating](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-nickel-plating).

### Why Ultrasonic Cleaners are a No-Go

Ultrasonic cleaners use sound waves to create tiny bubbles in a liquid. These bubbles implode, creating a scrubbing action. While effective for some items, they are terrible for coins. The aggressive action can damage the coin's surface. It can strip away toning and patina. It can even disturb the metal structure on a microscopic level. The result is a coin that looks unnatural and has lost its original character. I have seen collectors deeply regret using these machines.

## Proper Storage: The Best Way to Preserve Your Buffalo Nickel

Since cleaning is generally not advised, what *should* you do? The answer is simple: focus on proper storage. Good storage is the most effective way to protect your Buffalo Nickel. It prevents future damage and preserves its current condition. It safeguards the coin from environmental harm. It also stops new dirt or tarnish from forming. This means your coin stays stable for years to come.

Think of storage as preventive care. It is like putting on a seatbelt before driving. You are protecting your coin from potential hazards. Correct storage is a simple, yet powerful step. It keeps your coin safe from moisture, air pollutants, and physical damage. This method ensures its beauty and value last.

### Ideal Storage Materials

The right storage materials are crucial. Avoid certain plastics or materials that can harm coins over time.

*   **Non-PVC Flips:** These are clear, soft plastic holders. "PVC" stands for polyvinyl chloride. PVC can leach chemicals that damage coins. Always choose "non-PVC" or "archival safe" flips. These are inert and will not harm the coin. They come in various sizes.
*   **Mylar Holders/Slabs:** Mylar is a very stable plastic. Mylar holders offer excellent protection. Graded coins come in hard plastic "slabs." These are sealed, tamper-evident holders. They are the ultimate protection for valuable coins.
*   **Air-Tite Holders:** These are hard, two-piece plastic capsules. They create an airtight seal around the coin. This protects the coin from air exposure and physical damage. They come in specific sizes for different coins.
*   **Coin Albums:** If you use an album, make sure it has archival-safe pages. Some older albums use pages that contain harmful chemicals. Always check the materials.

### Environmental Control for Coin Longevity

Beyond the holder itself, the environment where you store your coins matters.

*   **Stable Temperature:** Store coins in a place with a stable temperature. Avoid extreme heat or cold. Basements can be too damp. Attics can get too hot. Fluctuations in temperature can cause condensation.
*   **Low Humidity:** High humidity is bad for coins. It encourages tarnish and corrosion. A dry, stable environment is best. Consider using silica gel packets in storage boxes for added humidity control.
*   **Away from Chemicals:** Keep coins away from chemical fumes. This includes paint, cleaning supplies, or even strong-smelling wood like oak. These fumes can accelerate toning and damage.
*   **Darkness:** Store coins in a dark place. Light, especially sunlight, can contribute to toning or fading. A safe, closet, or coin cabinet is ideal.

Remember to handle your coins only by the edges when placing them in storage. Use cotton gloves. This keeps finger oils off the coin. Proper storage is the true secret to maintaining your Buffalo Nickel's condition. It is the best cleaning method there is.

## When to Seek Professional Advice for Your Coins

You have learned that cleaning is generally bad. You also know about proper storage. What if you find a Buffalo Nickel that looks unusual? What if it has some strange debris you cannot identify? Or maybe you suspect it is a rare variety. This is when professional advice becomes invaluable. Do not guess. Do not experiment. Seek an expert.

Coin professionals have specific knowledge. They understand coin history, grading standards, and preservation techniques. They can tell you if your coin is valuable. They can also advise on the best course of action. This might involve professional conservation, which is very different from "cleaning."

### Identifying Valuable Buffalo Nickels

Before you do anything to a coin, you should assess its potential value. Some Buffalo Nickels are common. Others are highly sought after. Key dates and mint marks can make a huge difference. For example, the 1913-S Type 2, the 1937-D "Three-Legged" variety, and 1916/16 overdate are very rare. Their value can be thousands of dollars, even in circulated condition.

Look up your coin in a reputable coin price guide or online database. Pay attention to the mint mark and any unique features. If you suspect it might be valuable, stop. Do not try to clean it. Do not even try the distilled water rinse. Take it to an expert. A professional numismatist can accurately identify and value your coin. They can also spot errors or varieties you might miss.

### Numismatic Experts: Your Go-To Resource

A numismatist is a coin expert. They study and collect coins. These individuals can offer a lot of help.

*   **Local Coin Dealers:** Many towns have coin shops. Visit a reputable dealer. They can quickly assess your coin. They can tell you if it has collector value. Most dealers offer free verbal appraisals.
*   **Coin Shows:** Large coin shows often have professional graders and dealers. You can get multiple opinions there. This is a great place to learn.
*   **Professional Grading Services:** If you believe your coin is very valuable, consider sending it to a professional grading service. Companies like PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) or NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corporation) are the industry standard. They will authenticate, grade, and encapsulate your coin. They will also identify if it has been cleaned. This is the ultimate step for protecting and valuing a high-worth coin. They do not clean coins. They preserve them.

Remember, a professional will never recommend cleaning a valuable coin. They might suggest "conservation." Conservation is a specialized process. It removes harmful substances without damaging the original surface or patina. It is done by trained conservators using very specific, non-destructive methods. It is not something you can do at home. If you want to dive deeper into how different types of nickel items are cared for, you might look at articles like [how to clean brushed nickel bathroom fixtures](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-brushed-nickel-bathroom-fixtures) or [how to clean brushed nickel bath fixtures](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-brushed-nickel-bath-fixtures). However, always remember these methods are for fixtures, not valuable coins.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Cleaning Buffalo Nickels

### Q: Does cleaning a Buffalo Nickel reduce its value?
A: Yes, cleaning a Buffalo Nickel almost always reduces its value significantly. Cleaning removes the coin's natural patina and can create hairline scratches or an unnatural luster. Professional coin graders can easily detect cleaned coins, which results in a lower grade and much lower market value for collectors. It is best to avoid cleaning them.

### Q: What is the best way to remove green gunk from a Buffalo Nickel?
A: Green gunk on a coin often indicates verdigris, which is a form of corrosion. This corrosion means the coin is already damaged. You should not try to remove it yourself. Cleaning verdigris usually causes more harm. It can spread the corrosion or scratch the coin's surface. Professional conservation is the only safe option, but often it is not worth the cost for a common coin.

### Q: Can I use household cleaners on my Buffalo Nickel?
A: No, you should never use household cleaners on your Buffalo Nickel. Products like vinegar, lemon juice, baking soda, bleach, or commercial metal polishes contain harsh chemicals or abrasives. They will irreversibly damage the coin's surface, removing its original patina and causing permanent discoloration or scratching. This will destroy the coin's collector value.

### Q: How do professionals "clean" valuable coins?
A: Professionals do not "clean" valuable coins in the way most people think. Instead, they perform "conservation." This is a specialized process done by trained conservators. They use precise, non-destructive methods to remove harmful surface contaminants without altering the coin's original surface or patina. This is a complex process and not something you can do at home.

### Q: What causes tarnish on Buffalo Nickels?
A: Tarnish on Buffalo Nickels is a natural process called toning or oxidation. It happens when the coin's metal (copper and nickel) reacts with elements in the air, especially sulfur and oxygen. Over time, this reaction creates a protective, often dark, layer on the coin's surface known as patina. This patina is usually desirable to collectors.

### Q: How can I tell if my Buffalo Nickel is valuable?
A: To determine if your Buffalo Nickel is valuable, check its date and mint mark. Some dates, like the 1913-S Type 2, 1921-S, or the 1937-D "Three-Legged" variety, are much rarer. The coin's condition (how worn it is) also plays a big role. Consult a reputable coin price guide or a professional coin dealer for an accurate assessment. Do not clean it before checking.

## Conclusion: Preserve, Don't Polish Your Buffalo Nickel

I hope this article has helped you understand the importance of not cleaning your Buffalo Nickel. The immediate desire to make a dirty coin shiny is natural. However, with historic items like these coins, cleanliness does not always mean increased value. In fact, it almost always means the opposite.
