### Addressing Keurig K155 No Power or Not Brewing Issues

It's a quiet morning, and you press the brew button on your Keurig K155, but nothing happens. This can be quite alarming. A Keurig K155 not brewing or having no power is a common issue. Fortunately, many causes have simple fixes. You can easily check a few things before calling for professional help. My experience shows these initial steps often resolve the problem quickly.

First, always check the power connection. Ensure the K155's power cord is firmly plugged into a working electrical outlet. Sometimes, the problem is as simple as a loose plug. You can also try plugging another small appliance into the same outlet. This checks if the outlet itself has power. If other devices work, then the issue is likely with the Keurig K155 brewer itself or its cord. Also, check if a circuit breaker has tripped. Resetting a tripped breaker can restore power instantly.

Next, consider the water reservoir. Your Keurig K155 needs enough water to brew. Make sure the water reservoir is filled above the minimum line. The K155 has sensors to detect water levels. If the water is too low, it will not begin a brew cycle. Sometimes, the reservoir might be seated incorrectly. Remove the reservoir, clean its base and the machine's receptacle, then firmly re-seat it. An air bubble trapped in the water lines can also prevent brewing. To clear this, lift and lower the water reservoir a few times. This action helps to release any trapped air. You might also try running a hot water cycle without a K-Cup to prime the system. This flushes any air out of the lines. For more general troubleshooting advice that applies to various Keurig models, you might find useful tips in our guide on [Keurig coffee makers troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/keurig-coffee-makers-troubleshooting).

#### Power Supply Checks

Checking the power supply for your Keurig K155 is the first and most basic step. You should confirm the machine is correctly connected. This prevents unnecessary worry or further diagnosis. A stable power supply is vital for any appliance.

*   **Verify Outlet Functionality:** Plug another small appliance, like a phone charger or a lamp, into the same wall outlet. If the other appliance does not work, the outlet itself is the problem. You may need to reset a circuit breaker or use a different outlet.
*   **Check Power Cord Condition:** Inspect the power cord for any visible damage. Look for frayed wires, cuts, or bent prongs. A damaged cord can prevent power flow. If the cord is damaged, it might need replacement. However, be cautious and consult Keurig support or a professional.
*   **Secure Plug Connection:** Ensure the power plug is fully inserted into the wall outlet. Sometimes, a loose connection can interrupt power. Push the plug firmly into the receptacle.

#### Water Reservoir and Priming

The water reservoir is a critical component for your Keurig K155's operation. Its proper function ensures water flows for brewing. Issues here often lead to no-brew scenarios.

*   **Fill to Max Line:** Always fill the water reservoir to the "MAX" fill line, or at least above the "MIN" line. The K155 uses sensors to detect water presence. Insufficient water levels will prevent brewing.
*   **Proper Seating:** Remove the water reservoir. Then, re-seat it firmly into its base. You should feel it click into place. An improperly seated reservoir can prevent water from flowing into the brewer. This can also trigger "Add Water" errors.
*   **Clear Air Bubbles:** Trapped air can create a vacuum, stopping water flow. Lift the water reservoir up and down a few times. This can dislodge air bubbles. You can also try running several hot water cycles. This helps to prime the pump and clear the lines.

### Addressing Keurig K155 Leaks and Drips

A leaky Keurig K155 can be messy and frustrating. Discovering a puddle under your coffee machine is never a good start to the day. Leaks often indicate an issue with internal components or seals. My experience shows that most leaks on a Keurig K155 brewer can be traced back to a few common culprits. It is important to address leaks promptly. This prevents water damage to your countertop and internal components. Ignoring a leak can lead to bigger problems down the line, including electrical hazards.

One primary cause of leaks is an improperly seated water reservoir. As mentioned before, ensure the reservoir is fully and securely placed. If it's not seated correctly, water can seep out from the bottom connection point. Another common area for leaks is around the K-Cup holder or the dispense nozzle. Overfilling the K-Cup chamber can cause spills. Also, if the exit needle, which punctures the bottom of the K-Cup, becomes blocked or damaged, water might spray or leak rather than flow cleanly into your cup. Sometimes, the rubber O-rings or seals within the brewing mechanism can degrade over time. These seals prevent water from escaping where it shouldn't. If they are cracked or worn, water will find a way out. This might lead to water appearing around the base of the machine.

Beyond the reservoir and K-Cup area, check the drip tray. If the drip tray is full, it will overflow. This might appear as a leak from the machine. Regularly empty the drip tray to prevent this. If water appears to be leaking from inside the machine, it might be a more serious internal issue. This could involve a cracked internal hose or pump. In such cases, professional service might be needed. However, before that, a thorough cleaning and inspection of the external parts and connections can often identify the source of the drip. Look for visible cracks in the plastic housing. Even small hairline cracks can allow water to escape under pressure.

#### Checking for Visible Leaks

Identifying the exact source of a leak on your Keurig K155 is crucial for a successful repair. A systematic approach helps. This stops water damage and gets your machine working again.

*   **Inspect the Water Reservoir Connection:** Look around the base of the water reservoir where it connects to the brewer. If water pools here, the reservoir might be cracked or not seated correctly. Remove and re-seat it. Check for cracks in the plastic body of the reservoir.
*   **Examine the K-Cup Holder Area:** After brewing, check the K-Cup holder and the area around the dispense spout. Leaks here can result from a clogged exit needle or a damaged K-Cup. Ensure the K-Cup is properly inserted and not overfilled.
*   **Check the Drip Tray:** A full drip tray is a common "leak" source. Regularly empty the drip tray. If water constantly accumulates there even when you just emptied it, it may indicate a slow internal leak.

#### Understanding Internal Leaks

Internal leaks are harder to spot but can cause significant damage. These leaks often manifest as water appearing at the base of the machine. They require more careful investigation.

*   **Observe During Operation:** Place your Keurig K155 on a dry towel. Run a hot water cycle without a K-Cup. Watch closely for any drips or streams of water emerging from unusual places. This helps pinpoint the leak's origin.
*   **Check for Internal Component Cracks:** If you are comfortable, and after unplugging the machine, you might carefully inspect accessible internal tubing or connectors for cracks. Be cautious with internal components. If you are unsure, do not disassemble the machine.
*   **Worn Seals and O-Rings:** Over time, rubber seals inside the brewer can harden or crack. These seals are not always visible externally. If all external checks fail, worn internal seals might be the cause. This usually requires professional repair or replacement of parts.

### Solving Keurig K155 "Add Water" or Low Water Flow Problems

The "Add Water" message on your Keurig K155 can pop up unexpectedly, even when the reservoir appears full. This is a common Keurig K155 troubleshooting scenario. It often indicates an issue with water detection or flow. Sometimes, the problem is not a lack of water but a blockage preventing the machine from sensing it. Low water flow, where your coffee brews slowly or only partially fills the cup, also points to similar underlying issues. I've found that these problems usually stem from either sensor malfunctions or mineral buildup within the system.

The Keurig K155 uses a float sensor inside the water reservoir. This sensor tells the machine how much water is available. If this float gets stuck, or if debris interferes with its movement, the machine might incorrectly display "Add Water." Even with a full reservoir, the sensor might not send the correct signal. Cleaning the reservoir thoroughly, including the area where the float moves, often resolves this. Sometimes, the issue is not the sensor but the path water takes into the brewer. Mineral deposits, like limescale, can build up in the internal water lines. This restricts flow. Over time, this buildup can severely impede your Keurig K155's ability to draw water. This results in slow brews or the "Add Water" message.

Regular descaling is paramount to prevent and resolve mineral buildup. If you are experiencing low water flow or persistent "Add Water" messages, descaling is often the solution. It flushes out those hard water deposits that accumulate in the heating element and water lines. Using a descaling solution or white vinegar helps dissolve these minerals. This restores proper water flow. For comprehensive instructions on how to use vinegar to clean your brewer, you can refer to our guide on [how to clean keurig with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-keurig-with-vinegar). Additionally, ensuring the water inlet and outlet needles are clear is vital. These tiny needles, which puncture the K-Cup, can get clogged with coffee grounds or mineral deposits. This directly impacts water flow and can lead to a partial brew or poor taste.

#### Reservoir Sensor Check

The water reservoir sensor is vital for your Keurig K155's operation. If it malfunctions, the machine may not recognize a full reservoir. This results in the "Add Water" message.

*   **Inspect the Float Mechanism:** Inside the water reservoir, there is a small float (often magnetic). This float moves up and down with the water level. Ensure it moves freely. If it is stuck, gently push it down and release it a few times. Clean any debris around it.
*   **Clean Reservoir and Base:** Mineral deposits or debris can build up on the sensor contacts or hinder the float. Empty and thoroughly wash the reservoir with warm, soapy water. Rinse well. Also, wipe the area on the Keurig K155 base where the reservoir sits.
*   **Re-seat Reservoir Firmly:** After cleaning, re-seat the reservoir firmly. Make sure it clicks into place. A loose connection can prevent the sensor from communicating correctly with the brewer.

#### Addressing Mineral Buildup

Mineral buildup, or limescale, is a common culprit for low water flow and "Add Water" errors. It restricts water paths inside your Keurig K155. Regular descaling is the best preventative measure.

*   **Perform a Descaling Cycle:** Use a Keurig descaling solution or white vinegar. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for descaling your Keurig K155. This process dissolves mineral deposits in the internal pipes and heating element. A full descaling guide can be very helpful for your K155.
*   **Flush After Descaling:** After the descaling cycle, run several plain water cycles. This flushes out any remaining descaling solution and loosened mineral particles. This ensures your coffee tastes pure and prevents further clogs.
*   **Inspect Needles for Clogs:** The entry and exit needles can get clogged with coffee grounds or calcium. Use a straightened paper clip to gently clear any blockages in these tiny holes. Ensure you unplug the brewer first for safety.

### Keurig K155 Descale Light Won't Turn Off: A Comprehensive Guide

The descale light on your Keurig K155 is there to remind you to clean the machine. It warns of mineral buildup. However, sometimes the light stays on even after you have completed a descaling cycle. This can be confusing. It makes you wonder if the cleaning was effective. My experience indicates that this issue is usually due to an incomplete descaling process or a failure to properly reset the sensor. The K155's internal system needs to recognize that the descaling has been done.

The Keurig K155 has a specific sequence to reset the descale indicator. It is not always an automatic process after just one cleaning cycle. If the light remains on, it does not necessarily mean your Keurig K155 brewer is still dirty. It often means the reset procedure was not correctly followed. Or perhaps, the initial descaling was not thorough enough to clear the sensor's trigger. Hard water areas are particularly prone to rapid scale buildup. This may require more frequent or more intensive descaling. It is important to use the correct descaling solution or white vinegar solution. Using just water will not remove the hard water deposits.

If the descale light persists, you should review the exact descaling steps for your Keurig K155 model. Pay close attention to any instructions about specific button presses or brew cycles needed to complete the reset. Sometimes, repeating the descaling process a second time can also help. This ensures all mineral deposits are dissolved. It also helps if the sensor was still somewhat obstructed. Remember that routine descaling prevents many performance issues. It ensures your coffee machine brews at its optimal speed and temperature. This is a common maintenance item for all coffee makers. For more specific advice on descaling, especially for Keurig Duo models, which share similar maintenance needs, you can check out our article on [Keurig Duo Descaling Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/keurig-duo-descaling-troubleshooting).

#### Proper Descaling Steps

Performing a proper descaling cycle is essential for your Keurig K155's longevity and performance. Follow these steps carefully to ensure thorough cleaning. This will also help reset the descale indicator.

*   **Prepare the Solution:** Empty the water reservoir. Pour in one full bottle of Keurig Descaling Solution. Or, use 10 ounces of white vinegar. Then, fill the rest of the reservoir with water up to the 10-ounce line.
*   **Run Descaling Brew Cycles:** Place a large mug on the drip tray. Run several 6-ounce brew cycles until the "Add Water" message appears. Do not insert a K-Cup. Discard the hot solution after each cycle. Let the brewer stand for 30 minutes with the power on.
*   **Rinse Cycles:** After 30 minutes, remove any remaining descaling solution from the reservoir. Rinse the reservoir thoroughly. Fill it with fresh water. Run at least 12 full 6-ounce plain water cycles. This flushes out any remaining solution and dissolved scale.

#### Resetting the Descale Indicator

If the descale light on your Keurig K155 remains on, you may need to manually reset it. This procedure tells the machine that the descaling is complete. The steps are specific to the K155 model.

*   **Confirm Descaling Completion:** Ensure you have completed all descaling and rinse cycles. The brewer must be clean. Otherwise, the light will turn on again quickly.
*   **Access the Service Menu:** Turn off the Keurig K155. Press and hold the "Small Mug" and "Medium Mug" buttons together. While holding these buttons, press the "Power" button. Continue holding all three buttons until the display changes, usually showing "Service Menu" or a similar prompt.
*   **Reset Descale Counter:** Use the navigation buttons (if available) or the brew size buttons to find an option like "Descaling" or "Service Reset." Select this option. The specific wording might vary. Follow any on-screen prompts to confirm the reset. Once confirmed, the descale light should turn off. Power cycle the machine if needed.

### Fixing Keurig K155 Brewing a Partial Cup or No Coffee

It is disappointing when your Keurig K155 begins to brew, but then only delivers a few ounces of coffee or stops entirely. This problem, whether it is a partial cup or no coffee at all, points to a common set of issues. These often involve blockages or air in the system. My experience shows that these problems are frequently tied to the brewer's internal water path. Understanding where water flows from the reservoir to your cup helps diagnose the problem. The K155 needs a clear path for consistent brewing.

One of the most frequent culprits is a clogged needle. Your Keurig K155 has an entry needle that punctures the top of the K-Cup. It also has an exit needle that punctures the bottom. These needles can accumulate coffee grounds, debris, or mineral deposits over time. Even a tiny blockage can restrict water flow, leading to a partial brew or no coffee at all. The water can't pass through effectively. This causes pressure to build up or diverts water flow. Regularly cleaning these needles with a straightened paper clip is a simple yet effective maintenance task. Always unplug the machine before inspecting the needles for safety.

Another significant factor is air trapped in the water lines. An air bubble can create a vacuum lock, preventing the pump from drawing water properly. This is especially common after refilling the reservoir or if the machine has been moved. Running several hot water cycles without a K-Cup can help purge these air bubbles. Also, ensure the water reservoir is seated firmly and correctly. If it's loose, air can enter the system. The pump itself could also be failing, although this is less common than clogs or air. A weak pump may struggle to push water through the lines consistently. If you hear the pump running but no water dispenses, after checking for clogs and air, the pump might be failing.

#### Inspecting Entry and Exit Needles

The needles in your Keurig K155 are vital for proper brewing. Blockages in these small openings are a frequent cause of brewing issues. Keeping them clear ensures good water flow.

*   **Unplug the Brewer:** Safety first. Always disconnect the Keurig K155 from the power outlet before inspecting internal parts. This prevents electric shock.
*   **Clean the Entry Needle:** Lift the handle of your Keurig K155. Look inside the K-Cup holder. You will see a small needle pointing downwards. Use a straightened paper clip to gently probe and clear the opening of this needle. Twist the paper clip to dislodge any grounds or debris.
*   **Clean the Exit Needle:** Carefully remove the K-Cup holder assembly (it usually twists or pulls out). On the bottom of the holder, you'll find the exit needle. Use the paper clip to clear any blockages in this needle's opening. Rinse the K-Cup holder thoroughly after cleaning.

#### Air Bubble Removal

Air trapped in the Keurig K155's water lines can prevent proper water circulation. This causes brewing interruptions or incomplete cycles. Removing these air bubbles is a simple troubleshooting step.

*   **Perform a Water Cycle:** Fill the water reservoir with fresh water. Place a large mug on the drip tray. Run several 6-ounce hot water cycles without a K-Cup. This action helps to prime the pump and force any trapped air out of the internal lines.
*   **Shake the Reservoir (Gently):** If the problem persists, remove the water reservoir. Gently shake it side to side. This can help dislodge stubborn air bubbles or debris near the pump intake. Then, firmly re-seat the reservoir.
*   **Listen for Pump Sound:** If you hear the pump working but no water dispenses, it strongly suggests an airlock or a blockage. Continue running water cycles. Sometimes, it takes a few attempts for the pump to re-establish prime and push the water through.

### Troubleshooting Keurig K155 Error Codes and Display Issues

Modern coffee makers like the Keurig K155 often come with digital displays. These displays can show helpful information or frustrating error codes. When your Keurig K155 displays an error code, it's telling you something specific is wrong. Understanding these messages is the first step in Keurig K155 troubleshooting. A blank or frozen display is also an issue that needs attention. These problems can seem daunting, but many have straightforward solutions. My experience shows that most error codes relate to common operational failures or maintenance needs.

Common error codes on the Keurig K155 often relate to water-related issues. For example, "Add Water" is one of the most frequent (as discussed earlier). Other codes might indicate a problem with the brewing cycle, such as "Brew Interrupted" or similar messages. These can be triggered by a K-Cup not being properly inserted, or if the machine detects an internal fault. Sometimes, a general "System Error" or "E" followed by numbers may appear. These more generic codes usually suggest a need for a power cycle or deeper internal inspection. Always note down the exact error message. This helps when seeking further assistance.

Display issues, such as a blank screen, flickering display, or unresponsive touch screen, can also occur. A blank screen often points to a power issue or an internal circuit problem. A flickering screen might indicate unstable power or a loose connection to the display panel. For most display or general error codes, a simple power reset is the first line of defense. Unplugging the Keurig K155 for a few minutes and then plugging it back in can clear temporary glitches. This is similar to restarting a computer. If the problem persists, it may indicate a more serious hardware failure within the machine's electronic components. In such cases, contacting Keurig customer support or a certified technician is advisable.

#### Common Error Messages Explained

Keurig K155 error messages provide clues about what is wrong with your brewer. Knowing what they mean helps you quickly fix the problem. These codes guide your troubleshooting efforts.

*   **"Add Water"**: This message appears when the water reservoir is empty or the sensor detects insufficient water. Fill the reservoir to the maximum line. Ensure the reservoir is properly seated. Check the float sensor inside the reservoir for obstructions.
*   **"Brew Interrupted" / "Lift Handle"**: This often occurs if the K
