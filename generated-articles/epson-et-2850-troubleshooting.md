    *   Before loading, fan the paper stack.
    *   This separates sheets and prevents multiple feeds.
*   **Clear Jammed Paper:**
    *   Turn off the printer immediately.
    *   Open the paper output tray, rear cover, and any access panels.
    *   Gently pull out any visible jammed paper.
    *   Check for small, torn pieces using a flashlight.
    *   Close all covers firmly after clearing.

Sometimes, dust or paper fibers build up on the rollers. This makes rollers less effective. They struggle to grip paper. You can clean the rollers. Use a soft, damp cloth. Wipe the rollers gently. Ensure the printer is off and unplugged before cleaning. Wait for rollers to dry completely. This improves paper feeding. Avoid using harsh chemicals.

For persistent jams, check the printer's rear access door. Some paper jams clear easily from there. The manual provides diagrams for these access points. After clearing, close all doors and trays securely. Turn the printer back on. The error should clear. If it persists, restart the printer and check again. A thorough check prevents future issues.

## Addressing Epson ET-2850 Ink System Malfunctions

The Epson ET-2850 uses an EcoTank system. This means it has refillable ink tanks. This system is convenient. However, it can still have ink-related issues. Problems include ink not recognized, low ink warnings, or clogs. These issues affect print quality and stop printing. Understanding the ink system helps in troubleshooting. Proper refilling and maintenance are key.

First, verify the ink levels. The printer has clear windows for each ink tank. Check the physical levels. If a tank is low, refill it immediately. Use only genuine Epson ink bottles. Using third-party ink can cause problems. It might clog print heads. After refilling, ensure the tank caps are sealed tightly. Loose caps allow air in. Air in the lines can cause print quality issues.

If the printer shows an error about ink not recognized, check the cap position. The ET-2850 bottles have a specific key for each color. Ensure you use the correct bottle for each tank. The printer senses the ink type. If the error persists after refilling, try a power cycle. Turn the printer off for a few minutes. Then, turn it back on. This resets the ink level sensors.

Clogged nozzles are common ink system malfunctions. They lead to streaks or missing colors. You perform a nozzle check. If the check pattern is incomplete, run a print head cleaning cycle. The printer utility software offers this option. Run the cleaning cycle two or three times if needed. Wait a few minutes between cycles. This prevents print head damage from excessive cleaning. After cleaning, run another nozzle check. This confirms if the clogs are gone. You can find more specific instructions on [how to clean Epson print heads](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-epson-print-heads) to ensure complete cleaning.

*   **Verify Ink Levels and Refill:**
    *   Check physical ink levels in tanks through the clear windows.
    *   Refill tanks with genuine Epson ink when low.
    *   Ensure tank caps are securely closed after refilling.
*   **Address Ink Recognition Errors:**
    *   Confirm the correct ink color is in the correct tank.
