This guide will show you exactly how to clean fake eyelashes. We will cover the tools you need and simple steps for various lash types. You will also learn about proper drying and storage methods. Keep reading to discover how to make your favorite falsies last longer.

### Takeaway

Keeping your fake eyelashes clean means:

*   Drying and storing lashes correctly.
*   Protecting your eye health from bacteria.

### Main Query Answer

To clean fake eyelashes, gently remove old glue and mascara using a cotton swab and a gentle, oil-free makeup remover or micellar water. Rinse them carefully with cool water, reshape, and allow them to air dry on a clean surface or lash tray before storing them properly.

## Why Clean Fake Eyelashes? The Importance of Lash Hygiene

Cleaning your fake eyelashes is not just about making them last. It is also very important for your eye health. Lashes collect makeup, glue, dirt, and oil from your eyes. This buildup can cause problems if you reuse dirty lashes.

Unclean eyelashes can harbor bacteria. When you put these lashes back on your eyes, you risk infections. This can lead to red eyes, irritation, or even more serious conditions. Always prioritize cleanliness when dealing with anything near your eyes. Just as you would keep a shower clean to prevent unwanted growth, the same hygiene principle applies to your lashes to avoid bacterial buildup.

Regular cleaning also helps your lashes maintain their shape and softness. Old glue makes lashes stiff and unnatural-looking. Mascara residue can weigh them down and make them clump. Freshly cleaned lashes look better and feel more comfortable. They will hold their curl and density, giving you that perfect flutter every time.

By cleaning your fake eyelashes, you get more uses from each pair. This saves you money in the long run. It also reduces waste, which is a small but good step for the environment. Investing a few minutes in cleaning extends their life and keeps your eyes safe.

## Essential Tools for Effective Eyelash Cleaning

Before you start cleaning your fake eyelashes, gather all the necessary tools. Having everything ready makes the process smooth and easy. You will need a few simple items that you might already have at home. This preparation prevents interruptions once you begin.

First, you need a gentle cleaning solution. Micellar water is an excellent choice. It dissolves makeup and oil without being harsh. Some people use a mild, oil-free makeup remover or a dedicated lash cleanser. Avoid oil-based products, especially if your lashes are made of mink or if your lash glue is sensitive to oil.

Next, get a clean, shallow dish or a small bowl. This bowl will hold your cleaning solution. You will also need cotton swabs, often called Q-tips, or lint-free cotton pads. These are great for precise cleaning and removing stubborn residue. A pair of tweezers helps with handling the delicate lashes.

A clean spoolie brush is also essential. This is the brush that looks like a mascara wand. You use it to comb through the lashes and remove debris. It also helps reshape them after cleaning. Finally, have a clean paper towel or a lint-free cloth ready for drying. Always ensure your tools are clean before starting. Cleaning delicate items like fake eyelashes requires a gentle touch and the right tools, much like you would approach cleaning [fake diamonds](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-fake-diamonds).

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Strip Fake Eyelashes

Cleaning strip fake eyelashes is a common task. These are the most popular type of false lashes. Following these steps carefully will ensure a thorough clean. It also helps preserve their shape and quality.

### Removing Adhesive Gently

First, gently peel the lashes from your eyelids. Hold the lash by the band, not the individual hairs. Lay the lash flat on a clean surface, like a paper towel. Now, carefully remove any old glue from the lash band.

You can use your clean fingers or a pair of tweezers for this. Gently peel off the dried adhesive. Roll it away from the lash band. Be careful not to pull the lash hairs. This step is critical because leftover glue can make the lashes stiff. It also prevents new glue from sticking properly later. Think of it like cleaning old residue from a [fake skin tattoo](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-fake-skin-tattoo) - you want to remove the film without damaging the surface.

### Washing with Care

Now, it is time to wash the lashes. Pour a small amount of micellar water or your chosen oil-free cleanser into a shallow dish. Dip a cotton swab into the solution. Gently swipe the cotton swab along the lash hairs. Start from the base and move towards the tips.

Focus on removing any mascara, eyeliner, or other makeup residue. Be very gentle to avoid damaging the delicate lash fibers. Do not rub or scrub harshly. If needed, you can lightly submerge the entire lash in the solution for a few seconds. This helps loosen stubborn makeup. Remember, a light touch is key for delicate lashes.

### Rinsing and Reshaping

After washing, rinse your lashes carefully. Hold them under a very gentle stream of cool water. You can also use a fresh, damp cotton pad to wipe away the cleanser. Make sure all cleaning solution is gone. Residual cleanser can irritate your eyes later.

Once rinsed, gently pat the lashes dry with a lint-free cloth. Do not rub. Then, use a clean spoolie brush. Lightly comb through the lashes to separate the hairs. This helps them regain their original shape and fluffiness. If your lashes came with a curved tray, you can place them back on it. This helps them keep their natural curve as they dry.

## Cleaning Different Types of Artificial Eyelashes

While the general cleaning steps apply, different types of artificial eyelashes require slight variations in care. Understanding these differences ensures you clean them effectively. It also helps you avoid damage. Each material reacts differently to cleaning agents and handling.

### Caring for Mink and Silk Lashes

Mink and silk lashes are known for their natural look and lightweight feel. They are very delicate. You must be extra gentle when cleaning them. Avoid harsh rubbing or pulling. These actions can damage the natural fibers or kink the curl.

Use only oil-free cleansers. Oil can break down the natural fibers or loosen the curl pattern. Do not soak mink lashes for long periods. A quick dip in micellar water is usually enough. After cleaning, always comb them with a clean spoolie. This helps restore their natural fluffiness.

### Cleaning Magnetic Lashes

Magnetic lashes do not use traditional glue. This makes cleaning simpler in one way. However, they still gather mascara and eyeliner. The main focus for magnetic lashes is cleaning the tiny magnets on the lash band.

Use a cotton swab dipped in micellar water. Gently clean the lash hairs and the magnets. Make sure no mascara or eyeliner blocks the magnetic connection. Avoid soaking magnetic lashes. Too much water can affect the magnets over time. Let them air dry completely before storing them back in their magnetic case.

### Handling Individual and Cluster Lashes

Individual lashes and cluster lashes are applied in small sections. This means you might clean them while they are still on your eye, or after removing them. When removing, be extra careful as they are very fragile. They can lose their shape easily.

If cleaning off the eye, place them on a sticky surface like tape. This prevents them from scattering. Use a cotton swab with oil-free remover. Lightly dab and roll over the lash. Do not submerge them. Because of their small size and delicate nature, individual lashes often have a shorter lifespan for reuse compared to strip lashes.

## Proper Drying and Storage for Longevity

Cleaning your fake eyelashes is only half the process. Proper drying and storage are just as important. These steps prevent damage and keep your lashes ready for their next use. Skipping these steps can lead to misshapen lashes. It can also cause bacterial growth.

After cleaning and reshaping your lashes, they need to dry completely. Do not try to speed up the drying process with heat. Avoid hair dryers or direct sunlight. High heat can melt the synthetic fibers or deform the curl of the lashes. Always let them air dry naturally.

Lay the clean, damp lashes flat on a clean paper towel or a lint-free cloth. You can also place them back onto their original curved tray or a dedicated lash drying stand. This helps them maintain their natural curve. Ensure good airflow around them. Allow them to dry for several hours, or even overnight, to be absolutely sure they are dry. Any moisture can encourage bacteria.

Once completely dry, store your fake eyelashes properly. The best place is their original packaging or a specialized lash case. These cases protect the lashes from dust and damage. They also help maintain their shape. Keep the case in a cool, dry place. Avoid humid environments like bathrooms. Proper storage keeps your lashes clean, safe, and ready for many more uses.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning False Lashes

Cleaning fake eyelashes seems simple, but some common mistakes can ruin them. Avoiding these pitfalls will save you money and keep your lashes looking great. Knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do. Pay attention to these points for best results.

One common mistake is using harsh rubbing. False lashes are delicate. Scrubbing them vigorously can pull out hairs or break the lash band. Always use a gentle, rolling motion with a cotton swab. Another error is soaking lashes for too long. While a quick dip is okay, prolonged soaking can dissolve the lash adhesive or deform the lash shape, especially for mink or silk lashes.

Using oil-based cleansers on certain lash types is another mistake. Oil can break down the glue used to attach the lash fibers to the band. This can make the hairs fall out. It can also strip the curl from permed synthetic lashes. Always check if your cleanser is oil-free, especially for lashes meant for multiple uses.

Neglecting to clean the lash band thoroughly is also a common error. Leftover glue makes the band stiff and uncomfortable. It also prevents new glue from sticking properly. Take time to carefully peel off all adhesive. Finally, not letting lashes dry completely before storage can lead to mold or bacterial growth. Always ensure they are bone dry.

## When to Discard Your Fake Eyelashes

Even with the best cleaning routine, fake eyelashes do not last forever. Knowing when to discard them is important for hygiene and appearance. Reusing lashes past their prime can be harmful and less effective. Pay attention to the signs your lashes give you.

One clear sign is visible damage. If the lash band starts tearing or fraying, it is time to say goodbye. If many individual hairs are missing, or if the curl is permanently lost, they will not look good anymore. Damaged lashes also become harder to apply evenly. They may feel uncomfortable on your eyes.

Another reason to discard lashes is persistent residue. Sometimes, no matter how much you clean, old mascara or glue just will not come off. This can make the lashes look clumpy or dirty. It also provides a surface for bacteria to cling to. If they always look dirty after cleaning, they are ready for the trash.

Finally, consider hygiene. Even if lashes look fine, repeated use means repeated exposure to your eyes and environment. Over time, bacteria can build up in ways that simple cleaning cannot fully remove. If you have had an eye infection, always discard the lashes you wore during that time. For general use, most strip lashes are good for 10-15 wears with proper cleaning. Beyond that, it is usually safer to get a new pair.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I clean fake eyelashes?
You should clean your fake eyelashes after every 1-2 uses. This removes makeup and glue buildup effectively. Regular cleaning prevents bacteria growth. It also helps your lashes last longer. Consistent cleaning ensures they stay soft and beautiful for many wears.

### Can I use micellar water to clean fake eyelashes?
Yes, micellar water is an excellent choice for cleaning fake eyelashes. It is gentle and effective at dissolving makeup and oil. Ensure it is an oil-free formula. Apply it with a cotton swab for best results.

### What if my fake eyelashes lose their curl after cleaning?
If your fake eyelashes lose their curl, it might be due to harsh cleaning or hot water. To restore curl, gently wrap the lash around a clean, thin makeup brush handle or a cylindrical object. Hold it for a few seconds. Do this when the lash is slightly damp, then let it air dry completely.

### How long do fake eyelashes last if cleaned regularly?
With regular and proper cleaning, good quality strip fake eyelashes can last for 10-15 wears. Some high-quality mink or synthetic lashes may last even longer, up to 20-25 wears. Individual or cluster lashes often have a shorter lifespan due to their delicate nature.

### Can I use rubbing alcohol to clean fake eyelashes?
No, you should not use rubbing alcohol to clean fake eyelashes. Rubbing alcohol is too harsh. It can damage the lash fibers, dissolve the adhesive that binds the hairs to the band, and strip the natural look from mink or silk lashes. Stick to gentle, oil-free cleansers.
