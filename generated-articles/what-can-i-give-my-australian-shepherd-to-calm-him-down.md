## Calming Your Australian Shepherd: What You Can Give Them

Is your Australian Shepherd constantly bouncing off the walls, pacing, or showing signs of anxiety? I know how challenging it can be to live with an overly energetic or stressed dog. Australian Shepherds are beautiful, intelligent, and highly energetic dogs. Their incredible work drive means they need a purpose, and without it, their energy can turn into restlessness or anxiety. This often leaves owners asking: "What can I give my Australian Shepherd to calm him down?"

This article explores a comprehensive approach to calming your Australian Shepherd. We will look at proper exercise, mental stimulation, nutritional support, and environmental management. We will also discuss behavioral training techniques and when to seek professional help. My goal is to help you create a more balanced and peaceful life for both you and your beloved Aussie.

### Takeaway

*   **Meet Core Needs:** Provide consistent physical exercise and mental stimulation daily to fulfill your Australian Shepherd's natural drive.
*   **Routine is Key:** Establish a predictable daily schedule to reduce uncertainty and promote security for your dog.
*   **Consider Diet & Supplements:** Evaluate your dog's diet and discuss appropriate natural calming supplements with your veterinarian.
*   **Be a Calm Leader:** Your own calm demeanor directly influences your Australian Shepherd's behavior.
*   **Seek Expert Advice:** Do not hesitate to consult a veterinarian or certified dog behaviorist for persistent or severe anxiety issues.

To calm your Australian Shepherd, provide ample physical exercise and mental stimulation daily. Consider diet adjustments, natural calming supplements, or pheromone products. Implement consistent training and a stable routine. Creating a serene environment and managing your own calm demeanor also helps significantly. For persistent anxiety, consult a vet or certified behaviorist.

## Understanding Your Australian Shepherd's Energy Needs

Australian Shepherds are wonderful dogs, but they come with a significant energy level. This is not just a stereotype; it is bred into them. Aussies were originally bred for herding livestock, a job that requires intense physical activity and sharp intelligence. This history means they possess a strong drive to work and move.

When these needs are not met, their energy can manifest in ways we might interpret as hyperactivity or anxiety. A bored Aussie is often a destructive or restless Aussie. They might chew furniture, bark excessively, or pace nervously. Understanding this fundamental aspect of their breed is the first step in finding solutions to calm them down. Recognizing [how do you tell if your dog is an Australian Shepherd](https://beacleaner.com/how-do-you-tell-if-your-dog-is-an-australian-shepherd) involves looking at these inherent traits, beyond just physical appearance.

Their high intelligence also plays a part. An Australian Shepherd's mind needs as much exercise as its body. If their minds are not challenged, they can become bored and act out. This combination of physical and mental energy means a simple walk around the block is often not enough for them. They need purpose and engagement to truly feel calm and fulfilled. When considering [what do I need to know before adopting an Australian Shepherd](https://beacleaner.com/what-do-i-need-to-know-before-adopting-an-australian-shepherd), their extensive energy requirements are always at the top of the list.

It is easy to misinterpret their high energy as "hyperactivity." Often, it is simply their breed characteristics manifesting due to insufficient outlets. My own Aussie, for example, would pace and whine if we missed our morning run. I learned quickly that his "nervous energy" was actually an unmet need for physical exertion. Meeting these core needs significantly reduces unwanted behaviors.

## Physical Exercise: The Foundation of a Calm Aussie

One of the most effective ways to calm your Australian Shepherd is through consistent and appropriate physical exercise. Aussies are not dogs that are content with short walks. They require vigorous activity to burn off their abundant energy. If they do not get enough exercise, they will find their own ways to release that pent-up energy, which often includes destructive chewing, excessive barking, or general restlessness inside the house.

Think beyond just walks. Activities like fetching a ball or frisbee in a large, secure area are excellent. Running, hiking, or even swimming can be fantastic outlets for their energy. If you are a runner, your Australian Shepherd can be a great companion. Agility courses or other dog sports provide both physical and mental challenges. Aim for at least 1-2 hours of intense exercise daily, broken into multiple sessions. This amount can vary based on age, health, and individual temperament, but it is a good starting point.

A well-exercised Aussie is a tired Aussie, and a tired Aussie is a calm Aussie. I noticed a huge difference in my own dog's behavior once I committed to his exercise routine. He went from being a whirlwind of motion to happily napping by my feet after our morning activities. Regular, high-intensity exercise helps regulate their mood and reduces anxiety. It also helps prevent boredom, a major cause of unwanted behaviors.

Remember, consistency is key. Sporadic bursts of exercise followed by long periods of inactivity can confuse your dog. Establish a routine and stick to it as much as possible. This predictability also contributes to their sense of security.

## Mental Stimulation: Engaging Their Clever Minds

Beyond physical exertion, providing ample mental stimulation is crucial for calming your Australian Shepherd. These dogs are incredibly intelligent and thrive when their minds are challenged. A physically tired Aussie might still be mentally restless if their brains are not engaged. Mental fatigue can be just as effective as physical fatigue in promoting calmness.

One excellent way to offer mental stimulation is through puzzle toys. These toys require your dog to figure out how to get treats or food, engaging their problem-solving skills. Snuffle mats and treat-dispensing toys can keep them occupied for significant periods. I often use these when I need a quiet moment, and they work wonders for my Aussie. They encourage independent thinking and can reduce boredom-related behaviors.

Training sessions are another powerful tool for mental exercise. Regular obedience training, learning new tricks, or practicing advanced commands keeps their minds active. Even 15-20 minutes of focused training a few times a day can tire an Aussie more than a long walk. It strengthens your bond and reinforces good behavior. My dog loves learning new tricks, and the mental effort visibly calms him afterward.

Consider introducing nose work games, where your dog uses their incredible sense of smell to find hidden treats. Scent work is incredibly tiring for dogs and can be done indoors or outdoors. It builds confidence and provides a productive outlet for their natural instincts. Incorporating these mental activities into your daily routine provides a crucial component for a truly calm and well-adjusted Australian Shepherd.

## Diet, Treats, and Natural Supplements to Calm Your Australian Shepherd

What you put into your Australian Shepherd's body can significantly affect his behavior and calmness. A proper diet is the foundation. Some commercial dog foods contain fillers, artificial colors, and preservatives that can contribute to hyperactivity or sensitivities in some dogs. Opt for high-quality dog food with whole ingredients and minimal additives. I always check the ingredient list for my dog to ensure he is getting wholesome nutrition.

Beyond diet, specific calming treats and natural supplements can help manage anxiety or excess energy. Many calming treats contain ingredients known for their calming properties. Common ingredients include:

*   **L-Theanine:** An amino acid found in green tea, known to promote relaxation without drowsiness.
*   **Tryptophan:** An amino acid that is a precursor to serotonin, a neurotransmitter associated with mood regulation.
*   **Chamomile:** A herb with mild sedative properties.
*   **Ginger:** Can help with an upset stomach, which sometimes accompanies anxiety.
*   **Valerian Root:** Another herb traditionally used for its calming effects.

For supplements, some owners explore options like CBD oil. CBD products for pets are increasingly popular for anxiety, pain, and other issues. It is crucial to use pet-specific CBD products from reputable sources and start with a low dose. Always discuss CBD use with your veterinarian before giving it to your dog. They can advise on dosage and potential interactions.

Other supplements include Zylkene, a hydrolyzed milk protein that promotes relaxation, and melatonin, which can aid sleep and sometimes help with situational anxiety. Probiotics can also support gut health, which is increasingly linked to mood and behavior. Before giving your Australian Shepherd any new treat or supplement, please consult your veterinarian. They can help you determine the right product and dosage, ensuring it is safe and appropriate for your specific dog. Some dogs might have underlying medical conditions that contribute to their behavior, and supplements are not a substitute for veterinary care. If your dog also displays aggression, understanding [what can I give my aggressive dog to calm him down](https://beacleaner.com/what-can-i-give-my-aggressive-dog-to-calm-him-down) might involve a combination of these supplements and behavioral interventions.

## Creating a Calm Environment and Routine for Your Australian Shepherd

The environment your Australian Shepherd lives in plays a significant role in their overall calmness. Dogs thrive on predictability and routine. A chaotic or inconsistent home environment can increase anxiety and lead to restless behavior. Establishing a clear, consistent daily schedule helps your Aussie feel secure and know what to expect. This includes consistent feeding times, exercise times, and even bedtime.

Designating a safe, quiet space for your dog is also crucial. This could be a crate, a dog bed in a quiet corner, or a specific room. This space should be their sanctuary, a place where they can retreat and feel safe when overwhelmed or tired. Teach them that this is a positive place. My Aussie's crate is his cozy den, and he happily goes there when he needs a break.

Various calming aids can also contribute to a serene environment. Pheromone diffusers, such as Adaptil, release synthetic dog appeasing pheromones that mimic those mothers produce to calm their puppies. These can help reduce stress and anxiety in some dogs. Calming music, specifically designed for pets, can also create a soothing atmosphere. There are many playlists available online that can help settle anxious dogs.

ThunderShirts or anxiety wraps apply gentle, constant pressure, similar to swaddling a baby. This pressure can have a calming effect on some dogs during stressful events like thunderstorms, fireworks, or vet visits. Minimizing exposure to known stressors is also important. If your dog reacts strongly to certain sounds or sights, try to manage their exposure or gradually desensitize them with professional guidance. A stable, peaceful home environment, combined with a predictable routine, provides a strong foundation for your Australian Shepherd's calmness.

## Training and Behavioral Management Techniques

Effective training and consistent behavioral management are essential tools for calming your Australian Shepherd. Training provides mental stimulation, builds confidence, and strengthens the bond between you and your dog. It gives them a job to do and clear expectations, which reduces uncertainty and anxiety. Positive reinforcement methods work best, rewarding desired behaviors rather than punishing unwanted ones.

Teaching basic obedience commands like "sit," "stay," "down," and "come" is fundamental. These commands help you manage your dog's behavior in various situations. For example, a solid "down-stay" can be used to settle your Aussie when guests arrive or during times of excitement. My Aussie knows that "place" means to go to his mat and relax, which is incredibly useful for managing his energy indoors.

Crate training, when done correctly, can be a wonderful tool for an Australian Shepherd. A crate provides a secure, den-like space where your dog can feel safe and calm. It also helps with house-training and prevents destructive behaviors when you cannot supervise them. Introduce the crate gradually and make it a positive experience with treats and toys. Never use the crate as punishment.

For specific anxiety triggers, techniques like counter-conditioning and desensitization can be very effective. This involves gradually exposing your dog to the trigger while associating it with something positive, like treats or praise. For instance, if your dog is anxious about strangers, you might start by having a stranger stand far away, giving your dog treats, and slowly decreasing the distance over time. This process should be done carefully, ideally with guidance from a professional.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, your own demeanor plays a huge role. Dogs are highly attuned to our emotions. If you are stressed, anxious, or inconsistent, your dog will pick up on it and may mirror your feelings. Learning [how to become a calm person](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-become-a-calm-person) can directly contribute to a calmer dog. Projecting a calm, confident, and consistent energy helps your Australian Shepherd feel secure and relaxed. I found that when I started practicing mindfulness, my dog seemed to calm down in sync with me.

## When to Seek Professional Help for Your Australian Shepherd's Anxiety

While many Australian Shepherds can be calmed down with proper exercise, mental stimulation, and environmental management, some dogs may exhibit anxiety or behavioral issues that require professional intervention. It is important to recognize when your efforts are not enough and when to seek expert guidance. Do not feel discouraged if you reach this point; it means you are being a responsible pet owner.

Look for signs of severe or persistent anxiety. These might include excessive panting, drooling, destructive chewing, self-mutilation (licking or chewing paws raw), inappropriate urination or defecation, or aggression when left alone or faced with certain triggers. If your dog's behavior changes suddenly, or if their anxiety seems to be worsening despite your best efforts, a visit to your veterinarian is the first step.

Your vet can perform a thorough physical examination to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Pain, thyroid issues, or other health problems can manifest as behavioral changes, including anxiety or restlessness. It is crucial to address any medical causes before focusing solely on behavior. My friend's Aussie became restless due to a hidden ear infection, which was easily treatable.

If no medical cause is found, your vet might recommend consulting a certified professional dog trainer or a veterinary behaviorist. A certified professional dog trainer can help you implement effective training plans and behavioral modification techniques. They have experience with complex canine behaviors and can provide personalized strategies. For more severe cases, a veterinary behaviorist (a veterinarian with specialized training in animal behavior) is the best choice. They can diagnose specific behavioral disorders and, if necessary, prescribe medication as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Medication is never a standalone solution but can be a helpful tool in conjunction with behavioral therapy to manage severe anxiety.

Remember, seeking professional help is a sign of dedication to your Australian Shepherd's well-being. These experts can provide tailored solutions that you might not discover on your own, helping both you and your dog live a happier, calmer life together.
