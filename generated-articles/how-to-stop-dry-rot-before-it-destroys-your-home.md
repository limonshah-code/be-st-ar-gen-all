### Understanding Dry Rot: A Silent Destroyer

Dry rot is a type of fungal decay. It attacks timber in buildings. This fungus, *Serpula lacrymans*, breaks down wood fibers. It needs moisture to grow, but it spreads even through dry wood once established. This makes it a serious problem. It damages the structural integrity of your home.

The name "dry rot" is misleading. The fungus requires some moisture to start. Once it takes hold, it can dry out the wood. This leaves it brittle and crumbly. Dry rot causes significant structural weaknesses. It can affect floorboards, joists, and roof timbers. This widespread damage can be very costly to fix.

Dry rot often starts in hidden places. Attics, crawl spaces, and wall cavities are common spots. These areas often have poor ventilation. They also hold moisture well. This creates perfect conditions for the fungus. Early detection is hard because it hides. Knowing what dry rot looks like helps homeowners. Catching it fast prevents major destruction.

### Identifying Dry Rot Signs Early

Spotting dry rot early saves your home from widespread damage. You need to look for specific signs. The appearance of the affected wood changes. It often looks shrunken or cracked. The cracks often form a cube-like pattern. This is known as cuboidal cracking.

Another sign is a distinctive smell. Dry rot often smells damp or musty. Some people describe it as mushroom-like. You might also see visible fungal growth. This can appear as a cotton-like mycelium. It spreads across wood surfaces. Sometimes, you see fruiting bodies. These look like flat, plate-like mushrooms. They are often orange or brown.

You might also notice a fine, reddish-brown dust. This is the spores of the fungus. It settles on surfaces near the rot. Tap the wood with a hammer. Rotten wood will sound dull or hollow. It will also feel soft or crumbly to the touch. Pay attention to areas with high humidity or past leaks. Basements and bathrooms are common spots. Check these areas often for any of these signs.

*   **Cuboidal Cracking:** Wood shrinks and cracks in square patterns.
*   **Musty Smell:** A damp, earthy odor often comes from affected areas.
*   **Fungal Growth:** White, cotton-like strands (mycelium) or pancake-like fruiting bodies.
*   **Reddish-Brown Dust:** Spores settle on nearby surfaces.
*   **Soft, Crumbling Wood:** Wood loses its strength and feels weak.

### The Root Cause: Moisture and Poor Ventilation

Dry rot thrives in specific conditions. High moisture levels are the main cause. Water leaks from pipes, roofs, or foundations feed the fungus. Condensation from poor ventilation also contributes. These damp conditions create the perfect environment for spores to germinate. Wood with a moisture content above 20% is most vulnerable.

Lack of proper airflow is another big factor. Stagnant air allows moisture to build up. This moisture then gets trapped in wooden structures. Basements, crawl spaces, and lofts often have
