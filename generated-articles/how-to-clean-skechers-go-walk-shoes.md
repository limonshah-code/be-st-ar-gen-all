### How do you clean Skechers Go Walk shoes?

You clean Skechers Go Walk shoes by hand. Use a mild soap or detergent mixed with cool water. Gently scrub the surfaces with a soft brush or cloth. Rinse thoroughly and allow them to air dry completely. This method protects the materials and maintains the shoe's comfort and shape.

## Understanding Skechers Go Walk Materials

Skechers Go Walk shoes are popular for their comfort. They use various materials. Most models feature knit mesh, soft fabric, or synthetic overlays. These materials are lightweight and breathable. They offer great flexibility. Understanding these materials is important for proper cleaning.

Mesh fabrics allow air to flow through the shoe. This keeps your feet cool. Fabric materials offer a soft feel. Synthetic overlays provide structure and support. These materials can absorb dirt and sweat. This makes regular cleaning essential.

Some Go Walk shoes may have a knit upper. Others might use a soft textile. The cleaning method often remains similar for these soft materials. However, delicate knits need a gentler touch. Always check your shoe's specific care instructions if available. Generally, you will treat most Go Walk shoes in a similar way because of their soft, fabric-like construction.

Cleaning these materials effectively means being gentle. Harsh scrubbing can damage the fabric fibers. Strong chemicals can strip colors or break down glues. Our goal is to remove dirt without harming the shoe's integrity. We want your Go Walk shoes to stay comfortable and supportive. Knowing the material helps you choose the right tools and techniques. This ensures a safe and thorough clean.

## Essential Tools and Cleaning Supplies for Go Walk Shoes

Cleaning your Skechers Go Walk shoes requires simple items. You likely have most of these at home already. Gathering your supplies before you start saves time. It makes the cleaning process smooth. You do not need fancy equipment to get good results.

First, you will need a **mild soap or detergent**. I recommend using a dish soap like Dawn. You can also use a gentle laundry detergent. Baby shampoo works well too. Avoid strong cleaners or bleach. These can damage the shoe fabric or color. Next, get a **soft-bristled brush**. An old toothbrush is perfect for this. A soft cloth or sponge is also useful. These help apply the cleaning solution gently.

You will also need two **clean bowls or buckets**. One will hold your cleaning solution. The other will be for rinsing. A few **clean towels** are essential. They help blot excess water. They also help dry the shoes later. Finally, you need **cool water**. Do not use hot water. Hot water can shrink or damage shoe materials.

Optional items include shoe trees or crumpled newspaper. These help maintain the shoe's shape while drying. A shoe deodorizer is also a good idea for later use. These tools are all simple. They help you clean your Skechers Go Walk shoes without causing harm. Proper tools lead to better cleaning results. They also help extend the life of your favorite footwear. Remember, gentle care is key for delicate shoe materials.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Hand Washing Skechers Go Walk Shoes

Hand washing is the safest method for cleaning your Skechers Go Walk shoes. This gentle approach protects their materials. It helps maintain their comfort and shape. I always hand wash my Go Walks. This process ensures a thorough clean without risking damage.

### Prepare Your Shoes

First, remove any loose dirt. Take your shoes outside. Clap them together to knock off mud or debris. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush to gently brush off dried dirt. Pay attention to the soles and crevices. Removing large pieces of dirt makes the washing process easier. It prevents spreading grime around.

Next, remove the insoles and laces. Skechers Go Walk insoles are often removable. Removing them allows for a deeper clean. It also helps them dry faster. Set the insoles and laces aside. You will clean these separately later. This step prepares the shoe for its main wash.

### Create Your Cleaning Solution

Get a bowl or bucket. Fill it with cool water. Add a small amount of mild soap. I use about one teaspoon of dish soap per gallon of water. Stir the water gently to mix the soap. You want a slightly sudsy solution. Make sure the water is cool, not hot. Hot water can damage the shoe's fabric and adhesives.

Do not use harsh detergents or bleach. These chemicals can cause discoloration. They can also weaken the shoe's materials. A mild solution is effective enough for most dirt and grime. This solution will be gentle on your shoes. It will still lift away dirt and stains.

### Gentle Scrubbing

Dip your soft-bristled brush or cloth into the cleaning solution. Make sure it is damp, not soaking wet. Start by gently scrubbing the exterior of your shoe. Use small, circular motions. Work on one section at a time. Focus on stained areas or spots with visible dirt. Be patient and gentle.

For tough stains, you might need a bit more solution. You might also need to scrub a little longer. Avoid pressing too hard. You do not want to damage the fabric. Remember, these shoes are made from soft, flexible materials. You can find more general advice on cleaning all kinds of footwear here: [how to clean shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes). This gentle scrubbing lifts the dirt from the fibers without harming them.

### Rinse Thoroughly

Once you have scrubbed all surfaces, it is time to rinse. Fill a second bowl or bucket with clean, cool water. Dip your shoe into the clean water. You can also hold it under a running cool water tap. Make sure all soap residue washes away. Soap left behind can attract more dirt. It can also leave stains when the shoe dries.

Rinse the shoes until the water runs clear. Gently squeeze excess water from the shoe. Do not twist or wring the shoe. This can damage its shape. Focus on removing all suds. A clean rinse helps your shoes look fresh.

### Clean Insoles and Laces

Now, clean the insoles and laces. Dip them into the same mild cleaning solution. Rub them gently with your hands or a soft brush. For insoles, pay attention to any dark spots or odors. These often accumulate sweat and dirt. Rinse them well under cool water. Ensure all soap is gone.

For stubborn stains on laces, you might need a bit more scrubbing. Laces can become very dirty. They absorb a lot of grime. Make sure they are thoroughly clean before rinsing. Clean insoles are crucial for overall shoe freshness. You can learn more about cleaning shoe interiors here: [how to clean the inside of shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes).

### Prepare for Drying

After cleaning and rinsing, gently blot your shoes with a clean towel. This removes excess moisture. Do not rub vigorously. Just pat the surfaces dry. This step speeds up the drying process. It also prevents water marks.

Stuff your shoes with clean, dry towels or crumpled newspaper. This helps absorb remaining moisture. It also helps maintain the shoe's original shape as it dries. Make sure the paper is plain, not colored. Colored newspaper ink can transfer to your shoes. You are now ready for the final drying step.

## Cleaning Specific Stains on Your Skechers Go Walk

Skechers Go Walk shoes are prone to stains, just like any other footwear. Different types of stains require specific approaches. Knowing how to tackle common stains can save your shoes. I have dealt with many types of stains on my own Go Walks. Fast action often makes cleaning easier.

### Mud and Dirt Stains

Let mud and dirt dry completely. Do not try to clean wet mud. Wet mud can spread and embed deeper into the fabric. Once dry, gently brush off as much dirt as possible. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush for this. Then, follow the hand-washing steps outlined earlier. Use your mild soap solution to scrub the remaining mud stains. Rinse thoroughly. This approach lifts dried dirt without spreading it.

For stubborn mud spots, a paste of baking soda and water can help. Apply the paste to the stain. Let it sit for about 15 minutes. Then, gently scrub and rinse. This can lift tough, dried-on grime.

### Scuff Marks

Scuff marks are common on the white or lighter soles of Go Walk shoes. You can often remove these with a magic eraser. Lightly dampen the magic eraser. Gently rub the scuff mark. The eraser works by gently abrading the surface. This removes the top layer of the scuff.

Be careful not to rub too hard. Excessive force can damage the sole material. For deeper scuffs on the fabric upper, follow the general hand-washing method. A dab of mild soap on a soft cloth may also work. Gently rub the area until the scuff fades. You can also explore general techniques for cleaning various shoe stains here: [how to clean stained shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stained-shoes).

### Food and Drink Spills

Act fast when you spill food or drinks on your Go Walk shoes. Blot the spill immediately with a clean, dry cloth. Do not rub, as this can push the stain deeper. Once you have blotted the excess, create a mild cleaning solution. Use one part white vinegar to two parts water. This is good for many food and drink stains.

Apply a small amount of the solution to a clean cloth. Gently dab the stain. Work from the outside of the stain inwards. This prevents the stain from spreading. Rinse the area with a damp cloth. Repeat if necessary. For greasy stains, a small amount of mild dish soap can be more effective.

### Oil and Grease Stains

Oil and grease stains need immediate attention. Sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder directly onto the stain. Let it sit for several hours, or overnight. The powder will absorb the oil. After absorption, brush off the powder.

Then, apply a small drop of mild dish soap directly to the stain. Gently rub it with your finger or a soft brush. Dish soap is excellent at breaking down grease. Rinse the area thoroughly with a damp cloth. Repeat if the stain persists. Always ensure all soap residue is removed to prevent new marks.

## Addressing Odors: How to Clean the Inside of Skechers Go Walk Shoes

Skechers Go Walk shoes can develop odors over time. This happens because of sweat and bacteria buildup inside the shoe. Addressing these odors is crucial for overall freshness. Cleaning the inside properly makes a big difference. I often find my Go Walks smelling much better after these steps.

### Remove and Clean Insoles

As mentioned, remove the insoles. These are often the main source of shoe odor. Wash them separately using mild soap and water. Scrub them gently with a soft brush. Pay attention to the heel and arch areas. Rinse them thoroughly until all soap is gone. Let them air dry completely before putting them back. Sunlight can also help sanitize insoles. A few hours in the sun can kill odor-causing bacteria.

If insoles are particularly smelly, consider soaking them. You can soak them in a solution of warm water and a small amount of baking soda. Let them soak for 30 minutes. Then, scrub and rinse as usual. For more in-depth advice on removing smells, check out our guide on [how to clean smelly shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes).

### Clean the Shoe Interior

Even with insoles removed, the inside of the shoe can retain odors. Mix a small amount of mild soap with cool water. Dampen a clean cloth with this solution. Gently wipe down the entire interior lining of the shoe. Pay attention to the toe box and heel areas. These areas accumulate a lot of sweat.

Avoid soaking the inside of the shoe. You just want to wipe it clean. After wiping, use a second cloth dampened with plain water. Wipe again to remove any soap residue. This ensures no soap is left to cause issues. This step tackles the direct source of many internal odors.

### Deodorize the Interior

After cleaning, it is time to deodorize. Baking soda is a natural odor absorber. Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda inside each shoe. Make sure it covers the entire footbed area. You can even put some into an old sock and place it inside. Leave the baking soda in the shoes overnight, or for at least 8 hours.

The baking soda will absorb moisture and neutralize odors. After several hours, simply shake out the baking soda. You can also use a small vacuum cleaner attachment to remove any remaining powder. For a fresher smell, you can also use a few drops of essential oil on a cotton ball. Place the cotton ball inside the shoe overnight. This adds a pleasant scent.

### Allow for Complete Drying

Proper drying is critical for odor prevention. Never put damp shoes away. This creates a breeding ground for bacteria and mold. After cleaning and deodorizing, ensure the shoes are completely dry. Place them in a well-ventilated area. You can stuff them with crumpled newspaper or shoe trees. This helps absorb moisture and maintain shape.

Air circulation is key. If possible, place them near a fan. Avoid direct sunlight or heat sources. These can damage the shoe materials. Allow at least 24-48 hours for complete drying. A fully dry shoe is less likely to develop new odors. A clean interior makes a big difference in the comfort of your Go Walks.

## Drying Your Skechers Go Walk Shoes Safely and Effectively

Proper drying is one of the most important steps in cleaning your Skechers Go Walk shoes. Incorrect drying can cause damage. It can shrink the fabric or warp the shape. It can also lead to mold or mildew growth. I always take great care in drying my shoes. This ensures they last longer and stay comfortable.

### Avoid Direct Heat

Never put your Skechers Go Walk shoes in a clothes dryer. The high heat from a dryer can cause irreversible damage. It can melt glues, shrink materials, or crack synthetic parts. This also applies to direct sunlight for prolonged periods. Strong sun can fade colors and weaken fabrics. Heat vents or radiators are also bad options. They can dry shoes too quickly and unevenly.

Instead, choose a cool, well-ventilated area. A spot indoors with good air circulation is ideal. This allows for slow, even drying. Slow drying protects the shoe's integrity. It ensures the materials retain their flexibility. This gentle approach is key to keeping your shoes looking and feeling new.

### Stuff with Absorbent Material

After hand washing and blotting, stuff your shoes. Use clean, dry towels or plain crumpled newspaper. Avoid newspaper with colored ink, as the ink can transfer to your shoes. The absorbent material helps soak up residual moisture from the inside. This speeds up the drying process.

Stuffing also helps maintain the shoe's original shape. As the shoes dry, they can sometimes lose their form. The stuffing provides support. Change the newspaper or towels every few hours if they become damp. This keeps the absorption process going. This simple step makes a big difference in how your shoes look after drying.

### Allow Ample Time

Drying Skechers Go Walk shoes can take time. It depends on the humidity and temperature of your environment. It also depends on how wet the shoes got. Generally, allow at least 24 to 48 hours for them to dry completely. Do not rush the process.

Ensure the shoes are dry both inside and out. Check the footbed and the toe area. These parts can hold moisture longer. Putting on damp shoes can lead to odors and discomfort. It can also promote bacteria growth. Patience is key here for proper care.

### Air Circulation is Key

Good air circulation helps shoes dry faster and more thoroughly. Place your shoes where air can flow around them. You can place them on a shoe rack. You can also place them on a clean counter. If possible, place them near an open window or a fan.

A fan can significantly reduce drying time. It moves air around the shoes. This helps moisture evaporate more quickly. Just avoid placing the fan so close that it blows directly into one spot for too long. Even drying is important. Proper airflow prevents stagnant moisture. This is vital for preventing mold and odors.

## Maintenance Tips for Long-Lasting Skechers Go Walk Freshness

Keeping your Skechers Go Walk shoes clean is not just about washing them. Regular maintenance helps extend their life. It also keeps them fresh between deep cleans. I follow these tips to make my Go Walks last longer. They are simple habits that make a big difference.

### Regular Spot Cleaning

Do not wait for your shoes to get very dirty. Spot clean small messes as soon as they happen. If you spill something, blot it immediately. If you get a small mud splatter, let it dry and then brush it off. A quick wipe with a damp cloth can handle many minor scuffs or smudges.

Regular spot cleaning prevents dirt from setting in. It makes deep cleaning less frequent. It also keeps your shoes looking presentable every day. A little effort often prevents a lot of work later on. This proactive approach saves time and effort.

### Air Out After Every Wear

After wearing your Go Walk shoes, let them air out. Do not toss them into a dark closet immediately. Take them off and place them in an open, well-ventilated area. This allows sweat and moisture to evaporate. It prevents odor buildup.

If you wear them daily, consider having a second pair. This allows one pair to fully air out. It also extends the life of both pairs. Airing out your shoes is a simple habit. It significantly reduces the chance of bad smells developing.

### Rotate Your Footwear

Wearing the same pair of shoes every day can wear them out faster. It also does not give them time to dry completely. Rotating your footwear gives each pair a break. It allows shoes to fully dry and air out between uses.

I have several pairs of shoes. I rotate them based on activity and weather. This practice spreads the wear and tear across multiple pairs. It helps each pair last longer. It also ensures you always have a fresh pair ready to go.

### Use Shoe Deodorizers

Even with airing out, odors can sometimes creep in. Use shoe deodorizers regularly. Baking soda is a natural and effective deodorizer. You can sprinkle it directly into the shoes overnight. Then shake it out in the morning.

Activated charcoal inserts are another great option. They absorb moisture and odors. Shoe sprays designed for odor control can also be effective. Use them after wearing your shoes. These products help maintain freshness. They keep your Go Walks smelling pleasant.

### Protect from Elements

While Go Walk shoes are great for daily wear, they are not always ideal for heavy rain or mud. If you know you will be in wet conditions, choose different footwear. Exposure to excessive water or harsh elements can damage the materials.

For light rain, a water-repellent spray designed for fabric shoes can offer some protection. Apply it according to the product instructions. This creates a barrier against moisture and stains. Protecting your shoes from the start makes cleaning easier later.

## What Not to Do When Cleaning Skechers Go Walk Shoes

Knowing what to avoid is just as important as knowing what to do. Certain cleaning methods can severely damage your Skechers Go Walk shoes. These mistakes can ruin their comfort, appearance, and lifespan. I have learned these lessons from experience.

### Do Not Machine Wash

This is the most important rule. **Do not put your Skechers Go Walk shoes in a washing machine.** While some athletic shoes can tolerate machine washing, most Go Walk models cannot. The agitation and high temperatures of a washing machine can:

*   **Damage the delicate fabric:** The rapid spinning and harsh cycles can tear or stretch the mesh and knit materials.
*   **Melt adhesives:** The heat can weaken or dissolve the glues that hold the shoe together. This can cause the sole to detach from the upper.
*   **Warp the shape:** The aggressive tumbling can distort the shoe's structure. This affects its fit and support.
*   **Cause discoloration:** Detergents or dyes from other clothes can stain your Go Walks.

For many shoes, including Skechers, machine washing is a risk. You can read more about machine washing various shoes here: [how to clean shoes in the washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer), but always check specific shoe type recommendations. Hand washing is always the safest option for Go Walk shoes.

### Avoid Harsh Chemicals or Bleach

Never use harsh cleaning chemicals, abrasive cleaners, or bleach on your Go Walk shoes. These substances can:

*   **Discolor the fabric:** Bleach can turn white fabrics yellow or cause permanent stains on colored shoes.
*   **Weaken materials:** Strong chemicals can break down the fibers and glues in the shoe. This leads to premature wear and tear.
*   **Leave residue:** Harsh chemicals can leave behind residues that irritate your skin or attract more dirt.

Stick to mild soaps like dish soap, baby shampoo, or a dedicated shoe cleaner. These are effective without being destructive. They are gentle on the shoe's fabric.

### Do Not Use a Stiff Brush

While a brush is useful, make sure it is soft-bristled. A stiff brush or abrasive scrub pad can:

*   **Fray the fabric:** It can pull apart the delicate threads of the knit or mesh upper.
*   **Scratch surfaces:** Stiff bristles can scratch synthetic overlays or the sole.
*   **Damage stitching:** Aggressive scrubbing can loosen or break the stitching.

An old toothbrush or a soft cloth is usually sufficient for cleaning. Gentle circular motions are best. Your aim is to lift dirt, not to scrub it off aggressively.

### Do Not Force Dry with Heat

As discussed, never use a clothes dryer, hairdryer, or direct sunlight to dry your shoes quickly. This includes placing them on a heater or radiator. The extreme heat can:

*   **Shrink materials:** Fabric can shrink unevenly, distorting the shoe.
*   **Melt components:** Plastic or rubber parts can melt or become brittle.
*   **Crush cushioning:** The specialized cushioning in Go Walk shoes can be damaged by heat. This reduces their comfort and support.

Always air dry your shoes in a cool, well-ventilated area. Patience is key for safe and effective drying. This preserves the shoe's shape and integrity.

### Do Not Submerge Leather or Suede Sections

While most Go Walk shoes are fabric or mesh, some models may have small leather or suede accents. If your shoes have these materials, avoid fully submerging them in water. Leather and suede require specific cleaning methods. Water can stain or stiffen these materials. For specific material shoes like leather, you can refer to dedicated guides like [how to clean leather shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-leather-shoes).

For fabric areas, hand washing is fine. For leather or suede parts, use a damp cloth or a specialized cleaner. This ensures you do not damage these delicate sections. Always know your shoe's specific components.

### Can I use a magic eraser on my Go Walk soles?

Yes, you can use a magic eraser on the white or lighter-colored soles of your Skechers Go Walk shoes. Lightly dampen the magic eraser and gently rub scuff marks or dirt. Be careful not to rub too aggressively. Avoid using it on the fabric upper, as it can damage the material.

### How do I get rid of bad smells in my Go Walk shoes?

To remove bad smells, take out the insoles and wash them separately. Wipe down the shoe's interior with a mild soap solution.
