### Understanding Lint Buildup in GE Dryers

Lint is a collection of fibers shed from fabrics during the drying process. These tiny fibers detach from your clothes. The dryer's airflow carries them. Most of this lint gets trapped in your dryer's lint filter. Some lint bypasses the filter. It settles in other areas of the dryer.

Lint can accumulate in the dryer's exhaust vent, ductwork, and even inside the dryer itself. This buildup is a major concern. It restricts airflow. Restricted airflow forces the dryer to work harder. This increases energy consumption. It also makes drying cycles longer.

For GE front load dryers, lint can also gather around the drum seals and the front door gasket. This is due to the dryer's design. This lint often escapes the regular filter. It creates hidden pockets of flammable material. Cleaning these areas is key. Ignoring lint buildup can lead to serious risks. It significantly raises the chance of a dryer fire. It also reduces your dryer's efficiency and shortens its lifespan. Regularly [how to clean GE dryer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-ge-dryer) helps prevent these issues.
