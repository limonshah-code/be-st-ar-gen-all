Using flowers in vases is classic. But there are many ways to make your floral arrangements stand out. The right arrangement enhances the vase's beauty. It also complements your room's style.

#### Fresh Flowers

Use empty vases to define a space. Place a tall vase in a corner. It can fill an awkward gap. Use a row of small vases along a shelf edge. This creates a visual boundary.
