### Stress, Anxiety, or Comfort: Licking as a Coping Mechanism

Not all licking is positive. Your dog keeps licking you, and it could be a sign of stress or anxiety. Licking releases endorphins. These chemicals help dogs feel better. For an anxious dog, licking can be a self-soothing behavior. It helps them cope with uneasy feelings. This is similar to how a person might bite their nails when nervous.

### Health Concerns or Discomfort: When Licking Signals a Problem

Sometimes, when your dog keeps licking you, it is not about affection or attention. It might be a subtle sign of an underlying health issue. Dogs often lick to soothe themselves when they feel pain. This self-soothing can extend to licking their owner as a plea for help or comfort. If the licking is sudden, intense, or unusual, pay close attention.

Dogs communicate through a complex system of body language. Licking can be a signal of submission or deference. In a pack hierarchy, a lower-ranking dog might lick the mouth of a higher-ranking dog. This shows respect. It is a way of saying, "I acknowledge your leadership." When your dog keeps licking you, they might be showing this same respect. They see you as the leader of their household pack.

This behavior is often accompanied by other submissive cues. Your dog might crouch down. Their ears might be back. Their tail could be tucked or wagging low. These combined signals tell you they are not challenging you. They are showing deference. This can happen after you have corrected them. It is their way of saying, "I understand."

While dog licks can be endearing, sometimes they become excessive. If your dog keeps licking you too much, you can gently guide their behavior. It is important to set clear boundaries. Start by identifying the cause of the licking. Is it attention-seeking? Is it anxiety? The solution depends on the reason.

If your dog seeks attention, ignore the licking. Turn away. Do not respond until the licking stops. Then, reward them when they are calm. This teaches them that calm behavior gets your attention. You can also redirect them. Offer a toy or a chew instead. This gives them an acceptable outlet for their licking desire. Consistency is key in this process. Everyone in the household must follow the same rules.

For anxiety-driven licking, address the underlying stress. Provide a safe space. Use calming aids like diffusers or gentle massage. If the licking is due to a medical issue, a vet visit is essential.

When your dog keeps licking you, it's also wise to consider health and hygiene. While dog slobber is not inherently dangerous for healthy individuals, it can carry bacteria. Dogs explore many things with their mouths. This means their tongues can pick up germs. If you have any open cuts or scrapes, avoid dog licks on those areas. Their saliva contains bacteria that could cause infection.

For most healthy people, a casual lick from a clean dog is generally harmless. However, children, the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems need to be more careful. Their immune systems are less robust. This makes them more susceptible to potential infections. Always wash your hands after interacting with your dog. This is especially true after they have licked you. Good hygiene practices prevent the spread of germs. It keeps both you and your pet healthy.

If your dog's licking is unusually strong-smelling or looks different, consult a vet. This could indicate a dental issue or other internal health problem. A healthy mouth is important for your dog's overall well-being. Regular vet check-ups ensure your dog stays in good health. This also reduces the risk of transferring any undesirable bacteria to you.
