## Initial Fios Internet Troubleshooting Steps

When your Verizon Fios internet stops working, start with simple checks. These steps often fix most Fios connection issues quickly. They do not require technical knowledge. These steps help determine if the problem is minor or requires more attention.

First, check if your internet is down on all devices. Sometimes, only one device has a problem. Try connecting on your phone, tablet, or another computer. If one device works, the issue is with the device itself, not your Fios internet service.

Next, confirm your Fios bill is paid. Service can stop if your account is past due. Log into your My Verizon account online. Check your billing status there. Verizon sends alerts for overdue payments.

### Power Cycle Your Fios Equipment

Power cycling your Fios router and ONT is often the first and most effective step. This process resets the devices. It clears temporary errors. This action re-establishes your internet connection.

1.  **Locate Devices:** Find your Verizon Fios router and your Optical Network Terminal (ONT). The ONT connects Fios fiber optic cable to your home. It usually mounts on a wall inside or outside your house.
2.  **Unplug Power:** Unplug the power cords from both your Fios router and the ONT.
3.  **Wait:** Wait at least 60 seconds. This allows all power to drain from the devices.
4.  **Plug In ONT First:** Plug the ONT power cord back in. Wait for its lights to stabilize. This takes a few minutes.
5.  **Plug In Router:** Plug your Fios router power cord back in. Wait for its lights to stabilize as well. This also takes several minutes.
6.  **Test Connection:** Try accessing a website on one of your devices. See if your internet works again.

This simple reboot can clear many Fios internet issues. It often solves slow speeds or no connection problems.

## Understanding Fios Router and ONT Lights

Your Verizon Fios router and ONT have indicator lights. These lights tell you the status of your connection. Knowing what each light means helps diagnose Fios internet problems. Different light patterns mean different things. You can quickly see if a specific part of your Fios system has an issue.

Each device has specific lights. The ONT typically has Power, PON, and Data lights. The Fios router has lights for Power, Internet, Wi-Fi, and sometimes MoCA or Ethernet. Pay close attention to the color and behavior of these lights.

### Fios ONT Light Meanings

The ONT is crucial for your Fios internet service. Its lights show the status of the fiber connection.

*   **Power Light:** This light should be solid green. If it is off, the ONT has no power. Check the power cord and outlet.
*   **PON Light:** This light should be solid green. "PON" stands for Passive Optical Network. A solid green light means the ONT receives a signal from Verizon's fiber network. If this light is off, blinking, or red, it means no signal. This indicates a problem outside your home or with the fiber line.
*   **Data Light:** This light should blink green when data is active. A solid green means data is available but idle. If this light is off, it means no data flow. This can suggest an issue with the connection to your router.

If the PON light is off or red, call Verizon Fios support. This problem usually requires a technician. It is not something you can fix yourself.

### Fios Router Light Meanings

The Fios router connects your devices to the internet. Its lights show the status of your home network and internet connection.

*   **Power Light:** This light should be solid green. No light means the router has no power.
*   **Internet Light:** This light should be solid white or green (depending on router model). It indicates an active internet connection from the ONT. If it is off, blinking, or red, the router is not getting an internet signal.
*   **Wi-Fi Light:** This light should be solid white or green when Wi-Fi is active. If it is off, your Wi-Fi is disabled. You can often turn it on through the router settings or a button.
*   **Coax (MoCA) or Ethernet Light:** These lights indicate connections to other devices or network extenders. A solid light means a good connection. A blinking light shows active data transfer.

If the Internet light on your Fios router is off or red after you power cycled the ONT and router, the issue might be with the connection between the ONT and router, or with Verizon's network.

## Checking Fios Cable Connections

Loose or damaged cables cause many Fios internet problems. A quick check of all connections can restore your service. I always make sure to check every cable. This simple step often saves a lot of time.

Verizon Fios uses specific cables for its service. Knowing where each cable goes helps. Check the power cords, Ethernet cables, and coaxial cables. These connections must be secure.

### Verifying Power Connections

First, make sure both your Fios router and ONT are plugged into working power outlets.
*   **Router Power:** Ensure the router's power adapter is fully plugged into the router and the wall outlet.
*   **ONT Power:** Check the ONT's power supply. It might be a small box connected to an outlet, or directly plugged in. Make sure it has power. Test the outlet with another device if you suspect it is dead.

Sometimes a power strip or surge protector can fail. Try plugging the Fios equipment directly into a wall outlet. This eliminates the power strip as a possible issue.

### Checking Ethernet and Coaxial Cables

Ethernet and coaxial cables carry your Fios internet signal. They must be connected correctly.

*   **ONT to Router (Ethernet):** An Ethernet cable connects the ONT to your Fios router. This cable typically goes from the ONT's "ONT" or "LAN" port to the router's "WAN" or "Internet In" port. Ensure both ends are fully inserted and click into place. A loose connection here will stop your internet.
*   **Router to Devices (Ethernet):** If you use wired connections for computers or game consoles, check those Ethernet cables too. Make sure they are secure in both the router's LAN port and the device's Ethernet port.
*   **Coaxial Cable:** Many Fios setups use a coaxial cable from the ONT to the router for TV and sometimes internet, especially older installations. This cable also connects to your Fios TV set-top boxes. Ensure this cable is tight at both the ONT, any splitters, and the router. A loose coaxial cable can affect both internet and [Verizon Fios TV troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/verizon-fios-tv-troubleshooting).

Look for any visible damage on the cables. Kinks, cuts, or exposed wires can block the signal. Replace any damaged cables you find. Verizon support can send replacements if needed.

## Diagnosing Wi-Fi Issues and Network Extenders

Sometimes your Verizon Fios internet works, but your Wi-Fi does not. This means the problem lies within your home network. You might experience slow Wi-Fi, or devices cannot connect. This section helps you check your Wi-Fi settings and issues related to Fios network extenders.

Wi-Fi problems can stem from many sources. Interference, distance from the router, or too many connected devices can all cause issues. Even settings on your router can impact Wi-Fi performance.

### Checking Fios Wi-Fi Settings

First, ensure your Wi-Fi is enabled on your router.
*   **Router Wi-Fi Light:** Look at your Fios router. Does the Wi-Fi indicator light show solid? If it is off, your Wi-Fi signal is not broadcasting.
*   **Router Button:** Some Fios routers have a Wi-Fi on/off button. Press it to toggle Wi-Fi if the light is off.
*   **My Fios App:** Use the My Fios app on your smartphone. You can manage your Wi-Fi settings from there. Check if your Wi-Fi is enabled. You can also change your Wi-Fi name (SSID) and password. Make sure these are correct for your devices.
*   **Re-enter Password:** On your device, forget the Wi-Fi network and reconnect. Re-enter the Wi-Fi password carefully. A typo can prevent connection.

### Troubleshooting Fios Network Extenders

Verizon Fios often provides network extenders to boost Wi-Fi coverage. If you use one, it can also be a source of problems.
*   **Extender Placement:** Make sure your Fios network extender is placed in a good location. It should be halfway between your router and the area with weak signal. Avoid placing it too far from the main router.
*   **Extender Power Cycle:** Just like your router, power cycling your network extender can help. Unplug it, wait 30 seconds, and plug it back in. Allow it to fully boot up and connect.
*   **Indicator Lights:** Check the lights on your Fios network extender. They usually show power and connection status to the main router. Consult your extender's manual to understand what each light means. A red or blinking light often indicates a connection problem.
*   **Interference:** Other electronic devices can interfere with your Wi-Fi signal. Cordless phones, microwaves, and even baby monitors can cause interference. Try moving these devices away from your router or extender.
*   **Fios Network Extender Troubleshooting:** For specific issues with your extender, consult a dedicated guide on [Verizon Network Extender Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/verizon-network-extender-troubleshooting). These devices help extend Wi-Fi range. If the extender itself has an issue, it will not improve your signal.

Sometimes, changing your Wi-Fi channel on the router can help. This avoids interference from neighbors' Wi-Fi networks. This option is usually found in your router's advanced settings.
