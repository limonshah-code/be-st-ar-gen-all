## How To Drain Summer Waves Pool

Summer comes to an end, or perhaps your pool needs a thorough cleaning. You own a Summer Waves pool. Draining it seems like a big task. I understand this feeling completely. Properly draining your Summer Waves pool is important for its longevity and your peace of mind.

This guide helps you through each step. You will learn about preparation, different draining methods, and safe water disposal. We will also cover important post-drainage care. By the end, you will feel confident to handle this essential pool maintenance task. Let's make draining your pool simple and easy.

### Takeaway

Draining your Summer Waves pool does not have to be difficult. Here are the key steps:

*   **Prepare your pool and area:** Clear debris, disconnect equipment, and plan water disposal.
*   **Choose your method:** Use the built-in drain plug with a hose for slow drainage or a submersible pump for faster results.
*   **Prioritize safety:** Turn off power, wear protective gear, and watch for slippery surfaces.
*   **Dispose of water responsibly:** Consider your lawn, storm drains, or local regulations.
*   **Clean and store properly:** Wash the liner, dry it completely, and fold it for winter.

### Draining a Summer Waves pool typically involves connecting a garden hose to the pool's drain plug for gravity-fed water removal or using a submersible pump for faster, more complete emptying. Always disconnect electrical components and ensure proper water disposal according to local regulations.

### Why Draining Your Summer Waves Pool Matters

You might wonder why draining your Summer Waves pool is so important. There are several good reasons. Draining ensures the pool's health and your property's safety. Understanding these reasons makes the task less of a chore and more of a necessary step in pool care.

One main reason is winterization. If you live in a colder climate, water freezing inside the pool can cause severe damage. Ice expands. This expansion puts immense pressure on the pool liner and frame. Draining helps prevent cracks, tears, and structural issues. It protects your investment.

Another common reason is repairs or deep cleaning. Sometimes, you need to fix a leak in the liner. Or perhaps you want to give the pool a thorough scrub. It is hard to do this with thousands of gallons of water in the way. Draining allows full access to all surfaces. You can then [clean the bottom of a pool](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bottom-of-a-pool) and walls effectively.

Relocation also requires draining. You might move your pool to a new spot in the yard. Moving a full pool is impossible. Even a partially filled pool is too heavy and risks damage. Draining makes the pool light enough to handle. Proper drainage also prevents stagnant water issues. If your pool has developed algae, draining is often the best solution for a fresh start. You can learn [how to clean algae from pool](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-algae-from-pool) more effectively when it is empty. This prepares the pool for safe storage or a fresh season of use. Taking the time to drain properly saves you headaches and money in the long run.

### Essential Tools and Preparations for Pool Drainage

Before you start draining your Summer Waves pool, gather the right tools. Proper preparation makes the process smooth and safe. Skipping these steps can lead to delays or even damage. I always make sure I have everything ready beforehand. This saves time and frustration.

First, you need a **garden hose**. This is essential for connecting to the drain plug. Make sure it is long enough to reach your desired drainage area. A standard garden hose works perfectly for this job. Next, consider a **submersible pump**. This is optional but highly recommended for faster draining. It significantly cuts down the time required. The pump needs a power source and another hose to discharge water.

You will also need a **screwdriver** or a **coin** to open the drain plug cap. **Work gloves** protect your hands. **Eye protection** is also a good idea. It shields your eyes from splashes or debris. Lastly, have some **rags** or **towels** ready for any spills. These simple items help you stay organized.

Once you have your tools, prepare the pool itself. Start by removing any large debris from the water. Use a pool net for leaves, bugs, and other floating items. This prevents blockages in your drain or pump. Next, disconnect all electrical components. This includes the filter pump, heater, and any lights. Turn off the power at the breaker box first. This is a critical safety step. You do not want electricity near water while draining.

Finally, think about where the water will go. Check your local regulations regarding pool water disposal. Some areas have rules about chlorine levels or where water can be discharged. Plan your drainage route carefully. Avoid draining directly into a neighbor's yard or a public street drain without checking. This thoughtful preparation ensures a problem-free draining experience.

### Method 1: Draining a Summer Waves Pool Using the Drain Plug

The simplest way to drain a Summer Waves pool involves using its built-in drain plug. This method uses gravity. It is the most common approach for above-ground pools. I find it very straightforward, especially for smaller pools. It does not require any special equipment beyond a garden hose.

First, locate the drain plug on your Summer Waves pool. It is usually a cap near the bottom of the pool wall. You will see a fitting designed for a garden hose connection. Sometimes, it has a small internal stopper that you twist to open. Grab your garden hose. Connect one end firmly to the pool's drain plug fitting. Ensure the connection is tight to prevent leaks. You do not want water spraying everywhere.

Once the hose is attached, direct the other end to your chosen drainage area. Remember the planning we discussed earlier. Ensure the hose lays downhill from the pool. Gravity will do most of the work here. The lower the hose outlet, the faster the water will flow out. Open the drain plug. Some models have a simple cap you unscrew. Others have an internal twist valve. Water will start flowing out immediately.

This method is slow. Draining can take many hours, or even a full day, depending on your pool size. Walk away and let gravity work. Check on the pool periodically. Ensure the hose remains in place. Also, watch for any blockages at the hose outlet. The water flow will slow down as the water level drops. The drain plug method works best if you are not in a hurry. It is perfect for an end-of-season drain. You can handle other tasks while the pool empties itself. For deeper cleaning after the pool is empty, you can focus on [how to clean above ground pool](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-above-ground-pool) effectively. This basic method is reliable and easy for anyone to use. It's similar to [how to drain a Bestway pool with a hose](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-drain-bestway-pool-with-hose), as many above-ground pools share this basic design.

### Method 2: Faster Drainage with a Submersible Pump

If waiting for gravity drainage is not an option, a submersible pump is your best friend. This tool significantly speeds up the process. I highly recommend a pump for larger Summer Waves pools or when time is critical. It also gets more water out than gravity alone.

A submersible pump sits directly in the pool water. It has an electric motor that powers an impeller. This impeller pulls water in and pushes it out through an attached hose. Most pumps come with adapters for standard garden hoses or larger discharge hoses. Before starting, place the pump in the deepest part of your pool. Ensure it stands upright. Attach a discharge hose to the pump's outlet.

Direct the other end of the hose to your chosen drainage location. This could be a storm drain, a lawn area, or a suitable waste point. Make sure the hose is free of kinks. Kinks stop water flow and can damage the pump. Plug the pump into a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet. This outlet protects against electrical shocks. Never use an extension cord not rated for outdoor use or a non-GFCI outlet. Safety is very important here.

Turn on the pump. You will hear it start. Water will begin flowing out rapidly. A good submersible pump can drain thousands of gallons per hour. This speed makes quick work of even large pools. As the water level drops, the pump continues to operate. Most submersible pumps can remove water down to an inch or two from the bottom. This leaves very little standing water. You will need to manually remove the last bit of water. This might involve tilting the pool or using buckets. While there are other methods for specific pool types, like [how to drain a pool with a sand filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-drain-a-pool-with-a-sand-filter) or dealing with [how to drain water from pool after rain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-drain-water-from-pool-after-rain), a submersible pump is versatile for most Summer Waves models. This method offers efficiency and thoroughness.

### Responsible Water Disposal: Environmental Considerations

Draining your Summer Waves pool means you have a large volume of water to discard. Proper water disposal is not just about convenience. It also involves environmental responsibility and following local rules. You must think about where the water goes. I always check my local regulations first. This prevents potential fines or environmental harm.

First, consider the chlorine level in your pool water. Highly chlorinated water can harm plants and grass. It can also affect aquatic life if it enters natural waterways. Let the water sit for a few days before draining if possible. Sunlight helps dissipate chlorine. You can also use a chlorine neutralizer product if you need to drain quickly. Test the water to ensure chlorine levels are low enough. The water should be safe for disposal.

Your **lawn** is often a good place for disposal. Distribute the water evenly across a large grassy area. Avoid concentrating it in one spot. This prevents erosion and oversaturation. Your lawn can absorb a lot of water. It benefits from the moisture, especially during dry periods. Make sure the water does not run into your neighbor's property or create standing puddles. Standing water can attract mosquitoes.

**Storm drains** are another option in some areas. However, storm drains often lead directly to rivers, lakes, or oceans. This means untreated pool water can become a pollutant. Always check with your local municipality before draining into a storm drain. Some areas strictly prohibit it. They may require you to drain into the **sanitary sewer system**. This usually means connecting your hose to a cleanout pipe. The water then goes to a wastewater treatment plant. This is the safest environmental option but might require specific connections.

Never drain pool water directly into streams, ponds, or natural habitats without permission. This protects the local ecosystem. Also, avoid draining water near your house's foundation. This can cause structural damage over time. By taking these steps, you ensure your pool drainage is safe for both your property and the environment.

### Post-Drainage Steps: Cleaning and Storage

After successfully draining your Summer Waves pool, the work is not quite finished. The post-drainage steps are crucial for maintaining your pool's condition. Proper cleaning and storage ensure your pool is ready for its next use. It also extends its lifespan. I always make sure these steps are done thoroughly.

First, **clean the deflated pool liner**. Even after draining, a thin layer of grime or algae might remain. Use a soft brush or sponge with a mild cleaner. Avoid abrasive tools or harsh chemicals. They can damage the liner material. Pay attention to the pool walls and bottom. Scrub away any stubborn spots. For a complete guide, you can refer to articles on [how to clean pool walls](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pool-walls) and general [how to clean above ground pool](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-above-ground-pool) instructions. Rinse the liner with a garden hose to remove cleaner residue. Ensure all dirt and cleaning agents are gone.

Next, **dry the pool completely**. This is one of the most important steps. Moisture left on the liner leads to mold and mildew growth. It can also cause the liner to stick together or degrade over time. Allow the pool to air dry under the sun. Flip sections over to ensure even drying. You can also use towels to dry tricky spots. Make sure the pool is bone-dry before proceeding to storage. This might take several hours or even a full day.

Once dry, **inspect the pool for damage**. Look for any small holes, tears, or weakened seams. It is much easier to repair these now than when you are trying to set up the pool next season. Use a vinyl patch kit for minor repairs. Addressing these issues now saves you from bigger problems later.

Finally, **fold and store the pool properly**. Fold the pool liner neatly. This prevents creases and cracks. Start from one end and fold it into a compact size. Store the pool in a cool, dry place. A garage, shed, or basement works well. Keep it away from pests that might chew through the material. Store all accessories, like the pump, hoses, and ladder, separately. Clean and dry them too. This organized storage ensures your Summer Waves pool remains in excellent condition. It will be ready for many more seasons of fun.

### Troubleshooting Common Drainage Issues

Even with careful planning, sometimes drainage does not go perfectly. You might encounter a few common issues. Knowing how to troubleshoot these problems saves you time and frustration. I have run into these challenges myself. Here are some solutions.

One common issue is **slow drainage** when using the drain plug. This often happens if the hose is not laid out properly. Check if the hose has any kinks or sharp bends. These restrict water flow. Also, ensure the hose exit point is lower than the pool's drain plug. Gravity needs help to do its job. A slight slope in the ground can make a big difference. Sometimes, small debris can partially block the drain plug. If safe, try to clear any visible obstructions.

Another problem is **water not draining completely**. Gravity drainage systems usually leave a small amount of water at the bottom. This is normal. If you need it completely dry, a submersible pump is better. If using a pump, make sure it is placed in the deepest part of the pool. The pump might stop working if the water level is too low for its intake. You may need to tilt the pool slightly to gather the remaining water. Or, use a bucket and sponge for the last few gallons.

**Pump issues** can also occur. If your submersible pump stops or does not start, check its power source. Ensure it is plugged into a working GFCI outlet. The pump's intake might be clogged with debris. Disconnect the power and check the intake screen. Clean off any leaves or dirt. Also, check the discharge hose for blockages. A pump can overheat if it runs dry for too long. Always supervise the pump and turn it off once the water is mostly gone.

Finally, you might face **stubborn dirt or algae after draining**. Even with a good drain, some residue can stick. This is where manual cleaning comes in. Use a stiff brush and pool cleaner. For tough spots, a pressure washer on a low setting can help. Be careful not to damage the liner. Addressing these common issues quickly helps you complete the draining process efficiently.
