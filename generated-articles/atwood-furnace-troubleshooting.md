**How do I fix an Atwood furnace?**
You fix an Atwood furnace by verifying power, propane supply, and thermostat settings. Next, inspect the ignitor, clear any blockages in the exhaust or intake, and check the furnace's fuse or circuit breaker. Most issues stem from these fundamental areas.

## Understanding Your Atwood Furnace System

An Atwood furnace provides essential heat for your RV. It operates using propane gas and 12-volt DC power. The system ignites propane to heat air. A blower then circulates this warm air through your RV's ducts. Understanding these basic functions helps with troubleshooting.

Your furnace has several key components. The thermostat tells the furnace to start. The blower motor pushes air. The ignitor lights the propane. A gas valve controls fuel flow. The circuit board manages all these operations. When one part fails, the furnace stops working. Many Atwood models, like the popular Hydro Flame series, share similar designs. You can find specific information on different Atwood models, including the [Atwood Hydro Flame Furnace Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/atwood-hydro-flame-furnace-troubleshooting) guide. This guide explains their operational specifics. Another valuable resource for common issues is the general [Atwood Camper Furnace Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/atwood-camper-furnace-troubleshooting) page.

### Basic System Operation

The furnace operation begins when the thermostat calls for heat. This activates the blower motor. The blower runs for a short time to clear combustion chambers. Next, the circuit board opens the gas valve. It then sends a spark to ignite the propane. Once the flame establishes, the furnace continues heating until the thermostat reaches its set temperature. This process repeats as needed.

Propane supply is crucial for heating. Your RV's 12-volt electrical system powers the fan and controls. A steady supply of both is necessary. If either is missing, the furnace cannot run.

### Essential Safety Measures

Safety is paramount when working with an RV furnace. Propane is highly flammable. Carbon monoxide is a dangerous, odorless gas. Always turn off the power and propane supply before inspecting the furnace. This prevents accidental ignition or electrical shocks.

Check for gas leaks if you smell propane. Use a gas leak detector or a soapy water solution on connections. Install and regularly test a carbon monoxide detector in your RV. This device alerts you to dangerous gas levels. Never operate a furnace if you suspect a gas leak or carbon monoxide buildup.

## Common Atwood Furnace Problems and Initial Checks

Many furnace issues stem from simple causes. Before complex diagnostics, check basic items. Power and propane are the most common culprits for a furnace not starting. A quick check of these can save much time. Knowing your specific model helps. For example, troubleshooting specific to the [Atwood 8535-IV DCLP Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/atwood-8535-iv-dclp-troubleshooting) guide addresses issues unique to that common unit.

### Power Supply Verification

Your Atwood furnace needs a stable 12-volt DC power source. Check your RV's house batteries. Ensure they are fully charged. Low battery voltage can cause furnace problems. The blower motor might run slowly or not at all. This prevents ignition.

Locate your RV's fuse panel. Find the fuse marked for the furnace. Inspect it for a break in the wire. Replace any blown fuses. Also, check the circuit breaker labeled for the furnace, if present. Reset it if it has tripped. Sometimes, issues with shore power or the converter can affect 12V supply.

### Propane System Inspection

Propane is the fuel for your furnace. Verify your propane tanks have enough gas. Open the main valve on the tanks fully. Sometimes, a safety valve on the tank or regulator can trip. This happens if you open the tank valve too quickly. Close the valve, wait a few minutes, then open it slowly.

The propane lines may contain air after a tank change. Purge the lines by lighting a stove burner for a few minutes. This removes air and allows propane to flow freely to the furnace. Check the propane regulator. It reduces tank pressure to a usable level for appliances. A faulty regulator can starve the furnace of fuel.

### Thermostat Settings and Function

The thermostat controls your furnace. First, ensure it is set to "Heat" mode. Set the temperature higher than the current room temperature. If the thermostat has batteries, replace them. Low batteries can make the thermostat malfunction.

Check the thermostat's wiring connections. Ensure they are secure and free of corrosion. A loose wire can prevent the thermostat from signaling the furnace. If the thermostat does not click when you adjust the temperature, it might be faulty. You can test this by jumping the thermostat wires, but only do this if you understand electrical circuits.

## Furnace Won't Light: Diagnosing Ignition Issues

A furnace that blows cold air or makes no noise often has an ignition problem. This means the furnace tries to start but fails to light the propane. The blower usually runs for a short time. Then it stops if ignition does not occur. This is a common symptom for many furnace models, including those found in campers. You can find more specific guidance on this type of issue in our [Atwood Camper Furnace Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/atwood-camper-furnace-troubleshooting) guide.

### Checking the Spark Electrode

The spark electrode creates the spark to ignite the propane. It is a small metal rod with a ceramic insulator. It sits near the burner assembly. First, turn off all power to the furnace. Locate the electrode and inspect it visually. Look for cracks in the ceramic. Also, check for heavy carbon buildup or soot on the tip.

Clean the electrode gently with fine sandpaper or a wire brush. Ensure the gap between the electrode and the ground metal is correct. This gap is usually about 1/8 inch. Consult your furnace manual for the exact measurement. A wrong gap prevents a strong spark.

### Gas Valve and Propane Flow

The gas valve controls the flow of propane to the burner. When the furnace attempts ignition, you should hear a faint "click" from the gas valve. This sound indicates it is opening. If you hear the click but no ignition, propane may not reach the burner. Or, the spark is too weak.

If you do not hear the click, the valve might be faulty. It could also be a problem with the circuit board. The board sends the signal to open the valve. Ensure propane reaches the furnace. You can loosen the gas line connection at the furnace (with extreme caution and only briefly) to confirm propane presence. This is very risky and usually unnecessary if other propane appliances work.

### Circuit Board Role in Ignition

The circuit board is the brain of your furnace. It controls the ignition sequence. A faulty circuit board often causes ignition failures. Look for burnt spots or signs of damage on the board. Sometimes, simply resetting the furnace by turning off its power for a few minutes can clear a temporary board error.

The board sends power to the ignitor. It also opens the gas valve. If the board is defective, these functions fail. Replacing a circuit board is a common Atwood furnace repair. It often resolves persistent ignition issues.

## Blower Runs Continuously or Not at All

The blower motor is a critical component. It pulls air into the furnace and pushes heated air through ducts. Problems with the blower cause various heating issues. Sometimes the blower runs but no heat comes out. Other times, it does not start at all. These issues need specific troubleshooting steps. Many RV furnaces, including models like Dometic, share similar blower issues. You might find parallel insights by reviewing our [Dometic RV Furnace Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/dometic-rv-furnace-troubleshooting) guide.

### Constant Blower Operation

If your furnace blower runs constantly without heat, it suggests a safety lockout. This means the furnace tried to ignite but failed multiple times. The blower keeps running to dissipate any unburnt propane. A faulty sail switch can also cause this. The sail switch confirms airflow before ignition. If it sticks open, the furnace thinks there is constant airflow, but no heat, leading to lockout.

Another cause is a tripped limit switch. This switch detects overheating. If it trips, the blower runs to cool the furnace down. This often points to restricted airflow. After the unit cools, the limit switch should reset. If it keeps tripping, find the airflow restriction.

### Blower Fails to Start

When the blower does not start, the furnace cannot begin its cycle. First, check for proper 12-volt power to the furnace. Verify the fuse is not blown. Next, inspect the blower motor itself. The motor bearings can seize over time. This prevents the motor from spinning.

You can try to manually spin the blower fan blades (with power off). If they are stiff or do not turn freely, the motor might be bad. The control board also sends the signal to start the blower. If the board is faulty, it will not send this signal. This prevents the blower from operating.

## Airflow Problems and Overheating Protection

Proper airflow is vital for furnace operation and safety. Restricted airflow leads to overheating. The furnace's limit switch then trips. This stops the heating cycle. It can also prevent the furnace from starting. Many RV furnaces, including popular Suburban models, experience similar airflow issues. You can gain additional insights from our [Suburban Camper Furnace Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/suburban-camper-furnace-troubleshooting) guide.

### Inspecting Air Intakes and Exhaust

Your Atwood furnace has an exterior intake and exhaust vent. These vents can become blocked. Mud daubers, birds, or other debris often build nests inside. This restricts the fresh air needed for combustion. It also blocks the exhaust of combustion gases.

Visually inspect these vents from the outside of your RV. Clear any obstructions. Use a vacuum or brush to remove debris. Blocked vents cause the furnace to overheat quickly. This triggers the limit switch, shutting down the unit for safety.

### Checking Ductwork and Vents

Inside your RV, check the return air grill and heat registers. Ensure all heat registers are open. Do not close too many vents. This restricts airflow. Check the ductwork leading from the furnace. Ensure no ducts are crushed or disconnected. Loose ducts leak heated air. This reduces overall heating efficiency.

The return air grill needs to be clear. If furniture or items block it, the furnace cannot pull enough air. This causes the blower to work harder. It also leads to overheating and unit shutdown. A dirty furnace filter can also restrict airflow, though many RV furnaces do not have traditional filters. Our guide on [How to Clean Furnace Filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-furnace-filter) provides general cleaning tips, which can be adapted for the intake screens on RV furnaces.

### Limit Switch Tripping

The limit switch is a safety device. It monitors the temperature inside the furnace. If the temperature exceeds a safe level, the limit switch "trips." This immediately shuts off the gas supply. It leaves the blower running to cool the unit. Overheating is most often caused by insufficient airflow.

Once the limit switch trips, the furnace usually goes into a lockout mode. You must reset it by cycling the power. If it trips repeatedly, an airflow problem or a dirty burner is the likely cause. Address these issues. Do not bypass the limit switch. It protects you from fire hazards.

## Electrical Issues and Circuit Board Diagnostics

Electrical problems are a common cause of Atwood furnace malfunctions. These issues range from simple blown fuses to complex circuit board failures. A solid understanding of your RV's 12-volt DC system helps diagnose these issues. The circuit board is central to all furnace operations. Its failure impacts everything. For specific electrical details concerning particular models, refer to resources like the [Atwood 8535-IV DCLP Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/atwood-8535-iv-dclp-troubleshooting) guide, which outlines common electrical problems for that unit. Similarly, general RV electrical knowledge from our [Atwood RV Water Heater Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/atwood-rv-water-heater-troubleshooting) guide can be useful.

### Fuses and Circuit Breakers

Every RV furnace has at least one fuse. This fuse protects the furnace's electrical components from power surges. Locate your RV's 12-volt fuse panel. Find the fuse labeled "Furnace." Pull it out and inspect the small wire inside. If the wire is broken, the fuse is blown. Replace it with a new fuse of the exact same amperage.

Some RVs also have a dedicated circuit breaker for the furnace. Check your main circuit breaker panel. Ensure the breaker is in the "On" position. If it has tripped to the middle position, push it fully "Off" then back "On" to reset it. A consistently blowing fuse or tripping breaker indicates a deeper electrical issue, such as a short circuit.

### Wiring Connections

Loose or corroded wiring connections can disrupt power flow. This leads to intermittent furnace operation or complete failure. Check all wiring connections at the furnace. Also, check connections at the thermostat and the circuit board. Wires should be secure and free of rust or green corrosion. Clean any corroded terminals with a wire brush.

Rodents sometimes chew through RV wiring. Inspect wires for any visible damage. Ensure the furnace has a good ground connection. A poor ground prevents proper electrical flow. This can cause various problems.

### Understanding Diagnostic Codes

Many modern Atwood furnaces feature a diagnostic LED light on the circuit board. This LED flashes in specific patterns when the furnace encounters a problem. These flash codes indicate the type of fault. For example, a certain number of flashes might mean "ignition lockout" or "limit switch tripped."

Consult your Atwood furnace manual for a list of these diagnostic codes. The manual explains what each flash pattern means. Understanding these codes helps pinpoint the exact problem. This makes troubleshooting much faster and more accurate. Without the manual, you can search online for your specific Atwood model's error codes.

## When Professional Help is Needed

Many Atwood furnace problems are resolvable with DIY troubleshooting. However, some issues require professional attention. Knowing when to call a certified RV technician is important. It ensures your safety and prevents further damage. Do not attempt repairs beyond your skill level.

Attempting complex repairs can be dangerous. This is especially true when dealing with propane and high-voltage electrical systems. If you suspect a gas leak, turn off the propane immediately. Then, call a professional. Similarly, persistent electrical issues could indicate a short. This poses a fire risk. A technician has specialized tools. They also possess the training to diagnose and fix these problems safely. They can identify subtle issues. They can perform necessary repairs correctly. This gives you peace of mind.

Cost is also a factor. Sometimes, a complex part replacement outweighs the DIY effort. A professional can provide an estimate. They ensure the repair is effective. Prioritize your safety. Protect your investment.
