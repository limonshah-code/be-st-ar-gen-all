### Most Frigidaire PureSource 3 water filter problems stem from incorrect installation, a clogged filter needing replacement, or air trapped in the system. Resolving these often involves reinstalling the filter, flushing the lines, or replacing the filter promptly.

## Understanding Your Frigidaire PureSource 3 Filter

Your Frigidaire PureSource 3 water filter works hard to give you clean, great-tasting water. It removes impurities like chlorine, sediment, and cysts from your tap water. This filter is a key component inside many Frigidaire refrigerators. Understanding its basic function helps when troubleshooting.

The filter uses activated carbon to trap contaminants. Water flows through this carbon block, becoming cleaner before it reaches your dispenser or ice maker. This process ensures your drinking water is safer and more enjoyable. Knowing how it operates helps you spot when something is not quite right.

### Filter Basics

The Frigidaire PureSource 3 filter is a twist-in style cartridge. It sits inside your refrigerator, often in the top right corner. The filter has a specific design to fit only certain Frigidaire models. It connects directly to your home's water line.

Water enters the filter from one side and exits cleaner from the other. A proper seal is critical for this process to work. If the filter is not seated correctly, water can bypass it or leak. We often overlook these simple details when problems arise.

### When to Replace Your PureSource 3

Most manufacturers recommend changing your PureSource 3 filter every six months. This timeframe ensures optimal filtration and water quality. Some factors like heavy water usage or poor incoming water quality might require more frequent changes. The refrigerator usually has a "change filter" light to remind you.

Ignoring this reminder can lead to decreased water quality. An old filter also slows down water flow significantly. It is always a good idea to mark your calendar or set a reminder for filter replacement. Timely changes prevent many common issues before they even start.

## Addressing Low Water Flow or No Water Dispensing

One of the most frustrating problems is slow water flow from your dispenser. Sometimes, no water comes out at all. This issue points to a restriction in the water line. The PureSource 3 filter is often the main cause.

Several factors can lead to this problem. Air trapped in the lines, a clogged filter, or a kinked water line are common culprits. Checking these areas step-by-step helps pinpoint the exact issue. We need to ensure water can move freely through the system.

### Air Trapped in the System

After changing your water filter, air can get trapped in the water lines. This trapped air creates a blockage. It prevents water from flowing smoothly to the dispenser. You might hear sputtering or gurgling sounds when you try to get water.

To fix this, you need to flush the system. Dispense water continuously for a few minutes. Aim for two to three gallons. This process pushes the air out of the lines. You will see the water stream become steady as the air clears.

### Clogged Filter Cartridge

A clogged PureSource 3 filter is a very common reason for low flow. Over time, the filter collects sediment and impurities. These particles build up, restricting water passage. This happens when the filter reaches the end of its lifespan.

If your filter is older than six months, replace it. Even if the "change filter" light is not on, a reduction in flow suggests a clog. A new filter will immediately restore proper water flow. This simple step often solves the problem. For general water filter maintenance that can prevent clogs, consider reviewing resources on [how to clean water filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-water-filter).

### Kinked Water Line

Sometimes, the problem is not the filter itself but the water line. The water line runs from your home's water supply to the refrigerator. A kink or bend in this line restricts water flow. This can happen if the refrigerator moved recently.

Pull your refrigerator away from the wall. Gently inspect the water line behind it. Straighten any visible kinks. Ensure the line is not pinched against the wall or other objects. A clear path for water helps your filter work efficiently.

## Tackling Bad Taste or Odor from Your Water Dispenser

No one wants to drink water that tastes or smells bad. If your Frigidaire PureSource 3 filtered water has an off-putting flavor or odor, it indicates a problem. This issue defeats the whole purpose of having a water filter. It means impurities are getting through, or something else is contaminating the water.

This problem often points to an expired filter. Sometimes, a new filter might need proper flushing. Stagnant water in the lines can also cause an issue. We must address these concerns to get fresh, clean water back.

### Expired Filter Effects

An expired PureSource 3 filter cannot effectively remove contaminants anymore. The carbon inside the filter becomes saturated. It loses its ability to trap impurities. This allows chlorine, sediment, and other particles to pass through. You will notice a return of tap water taste or smell.

Replace your filter promptly if it is past its recommended six-month lifespan. An old filter is not just ineffective; it can also become a breeding ground for bacteria. Changing it restores the water's fresh taste. Proper maintenance ensures optimal water quality from your fridge, similar to keeping your general refrigerator water filter clean, which you can learn more about at [how to clean water filter in fridge](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-water-filter-in-fridge).

### New Filter Flushing

You just installed a new PureSource 3 filter, but the water tastes strange. This is a common experience. New filters can release harmless carbon dust or air into the water initially. This gives the water an odd taste or cloudy appearance. It is not a sign of a faulty filter.

You must flush the new filter thoroughly. Dispense at least two to three gallons of water through the dispenser. Discard this water. This process clears out any residual carbon particles and trapped air. After flushing, your water should taste clean and fresh.

### Stagnant Water Issues

If your refrigerator's water dispenser is not used often, water can sit in the lines. Stagnant water can develop a stale or off-taste. This is especially true if the refrigerator is in a warm environment. It is not necessarily a filter problem, but it affects the filtered water's taste.

Try to dispense a glass of water daily, even if you do not drink it all. This keeps the water moving through the lines. If you have been away, flush a few cups of water before drinking. This simple habit maintains water freshness.

## Resolving Leaks Around Your PureSource 3 Filter

Discovering a water leak around your refrigerator's filter housing can be alarming. Leaks can damage your floors and other components. It indicates that water is escaping the sealed system. Addressing a leak quickly prevents more significant problems.

Common reasons for leaks include improper filter installation, damaged gaskets, or a cracked filter housing. We need to check each of these possibilities. A small leak can quickly become a big mess if ignored.

### Improper Filter Installation

The most common cause of a leak is a filter not seated correctly. When you twist in the PureSource 3 filter, it needs to click firmly into place. If it is loose, water can seep out around the connection point. This often happens if the filter is not aligned properly before twisting.

Remove the filter and reinsert it. Ensure it aligns with the housing grooves. Twist it firmly until you feel a positive stop or hear a click. This creates a tight seal. Run the dispenser for a minute to check for leaks. Many filter-related leaks, similar to issues found in [LG refrigerator water filter troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/lg-refrigerator-water-filter-troubleshooting), are often solved by proper reinstallation.

### Damaged Gaskets or O-Rings

The PureSource 3 filter housing and the filter itself have rubber gaskets or O-rings. These small rings create a watertight seal. If an O-ring is torn, cracked, or missing, water will leak. Sometimes, the O-ring gets pinched during installation.

Carefully inspect the O-rings on your filter and inside the filter housing. Look for any visible damage or displacement. If you find a damaged O-ring, the filter might need replacement. Never try to use a filter with a damaged O-ring. It will not seal properly.

### Cracked Filter Housing

In rare cases, the filter housing itself might have a crack. This crack allows water to escape regardless of filter installation. A crack can result from overtightening the filter or accidental impact. Small hairline cracks can be hard to spot.

Examine the plastic housing closely for any cracks or hairline fractures. Use a flashlight for better visibility. If you find a crack, the filter housing needs replacement. This usually requires a service technician. Do not attempt to repair a cracked housing yourself.

## Dealing with the "Change Filter" Light Still On

You just changed your PureSource 3 filter, but the "change filter" light remains illuminated. This is a common and annoying issue. It means the refrigerator's system has not registered the new filter. The light is a reminder, and it needs a manual reset.

Sometimes, a sensor malfunction can cause the light to stay on. This is less common but still possible. We need to ensure the reset procedure is followed correctly. The light will go off once the system recognizes the new filter.

### Resetting the Filter Light

After installing a new PureSource 3 filter, you must manually reset the filter light. The exact method varies slightly between Frigidaire models. Common methods involve pressing and holding a specific button. Look for a "Reset Filter" or "Water Filter" button on your dispenser panel.

Typically, you press and hold this button for three to five seconds. The light should then turn off. If your refrigerator does not have a specific button, consult your appliance manual. Sometimes, opening and closing the refrigerator door a certain number of times or disconnecting power briefly can also work.

### Sensor Malfunction

If the filter light still stays on after correctly performing the reset procedure, a sensor might be malfunctioning. The refrigerator uses a sensor to detect if the filter is installed. If this sensor fails, it might incorrectly believe the old filter is still in place. This can keep the light illuminated.

Sensor issues are rare but can happen. They are not something you can usually fix yourself. If you suspect a sensor problem, contact Frigidaire customer support or a qualified appliance technician. They can diagnose and repair faulty sensors.

## Troubleshooting Ice Maker Issues Related to Water Filter

Your Frigidaire refrigerator's ice maker and water dispenser share the same water source. If your PureSource 3 water filter has problems, it can affect your ice production. You might notice your ice maker is slow or produces strange ice cubes. This indicates a water supply issue.

A clogged filter restricts water flow to the ice maker. This leads to reduced ice production. Air in the lines can also affect ice quality. We need to ensure a consistent, clean water supply for proper ice making. For comprehensive ice maker issues, also check [Frigidaire refrigerator ice maker troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/frigidaire-refrigerator-ice-maker-troubleshooting).

### Slow Ice Production

A common symptom of a failing PureSource 3 filter is slow ice production. The ice maker needs a steady supply of water to fill the ice molds. If the water flow is restricted by a clogged filter, it takes longer to fill. This results in fewer batches of ice over time.

First, check if your water dispenser flow is also slow. If both are affected, replacing your water filter is the most likely solution. A new, clean filter will restore the proper water pressure. This allows the ice maker to fill quickly and produce more ice.

### Hollow or Small Ice Cubes

If your ice cubes are smaller than usual or appear hollow, it suggests insufficient water fill. This often happens because of low water pressure. The ice maker molds do not fill completely before freezing. Again, the PureSource 3 filter is a primary suspect.

A partially clogged filter allows some water through but not enough. This low flow leads to small or hollow ice cubes. Flushing the system for air or replacing an old filter usually resolves this problem. Ensure you prime the new filter correctly to remove air. Understanding how your filter affects water supply is key to troubleshooting various ice maker and water dispenser issues, as detailed in [Frigidaire ice maker troubleshooting manual](https://beacleaner.com/frigidaire-ice-maker-troubleshooting-manual).

## Steps for Replacing Your Frigidaire PureSource 3 Filter

Often, the simplest solution to many PureSource 3 filter problems is replacement. Filters have a limited lifespan. Installing a new filter correctly is vital for preventing future issues. It ensures optimal performance and clean water.

This process is straightforward. You do not need special tools. Following these steps ensures a smooth transition. Replacing the filter regularly keeps your refrigerator running efficiently.

### Locating the Filter

The Frigidaire PureSource 3 filter is typically located inside the fresh food compartment. You will usually find it in the upper right-hand corner. Some models might have it in the bottom grille, but the PureSource 3 is most often found internally. Open your refrigerator door to locate it.

The filter housing usually has a cap or cover. It often has an arrow indicating which way to turn. Familiarize yourself with its position before you start twisting. This makes the replacement process much easier.

### Twist and Remove

Once located, grab the old filter cartridge. Twist it counter-clockwise about a quarter turn. This action unlocks the filter from its housing. You might hear a slight hiss as water pressure releases.

Pull the filter straight out of the housing. Be prepared for a few drops of water to escape. This is normal. You can place a towel underneath to catch any drips. Dispose of the old filter responsibly.

### Install New Filter

Remove the new PureSource 3 filter from its packaging. Make sure to remove any protective caps from the O-rings. Align the new filter with the filter housing. Push it straight into the housing until it stops.

Twist the new filter clockwise about a quarter turn. You should feel it lock firmly into place. It needs to be snug to create a proper seal. Do not overtighten it. A click often signals it is correctly installed.

### Flush the System

After installing the new filter, it is crucial to flush the system. This removes any trapped air and carbon dust from the new filter. Dispense at least two to three gallons of water through the refrigerator's water dispenser.

Discard the first few gallons of water. You might notice the water sputtering or appearing cloudy at first. This is normal. Continue flushing until the water runs clear and steadily. This final step primes your new filter for optimal performance, a process similar to what you might do when troubleshooting other filters like those found in [PUR water filter troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/pur-water-filter-troubleshooting).
