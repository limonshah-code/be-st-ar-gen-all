### How do you winterize a tankless water heater?

To winterize a tankless water heater, you must first turn off its power and gas supply. Then, locate and open the drain valve and service valves to fully flush out all water from the unit and its connecting pipes. Finally, insulate any exposed water lines to prevent residual moisture from freezing and causing damage.

## Understanding the Threat: Why Winterize Your Tankless Water Heater?

Freezing temperatures pose a significant threat to your tankless water heater. Unlike traditional tank-style heaters, tankless units have small heat exchangers and intricate piping. Water inside these narrow passages expands when it freezes. This expansion creates immense pressure within the system. The pressure can easily crack heat exchangers, burst water lines, or damage internal components. Such damage often leads to expensive repairs or even complete unit replacement.

Imagine waking up to no hot water and a flooded basement. This scenario is a real possibility if you do not winterize your tankless water heater. The cost of repairing freeze damage can far exceed the effort of proper winterization. Taking preventive steps now saves you money and stress later. Protecting your unit ensures it functions efficiently when you need it most.

Beyond immediate damage, freezing can also lead to long-term issues. Repeated freezing and thawing cycles can weaken materials, leading to leaks down the line. Even small hairline cracks can cause significant water damage over time. This makes proper winterization a crucial part of your home's seasonal maintenance. It safeguards your investment and provides peace of mind throughout the colder months.

Many modern tankless water heaters have built-in freeze protection. This system activates heating elements to prevent water from freezing inside the unit. However, this protection often relies on a continuous power supply. It also does not protect external water lines or the unit if it loses power during a severe winter storm. Therefore, manual winterization is often the safest bet, especially for homes that will be vacant or in very cold climates. For specific advice on keeping outdoor units safe, you might find this guide helpful: [how to keep outdoor tankless water heater from freezing](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-keep-outdoor-tankless-water-heater-from-freezing). It covers additional steps for units in exposed environments.

## Essential Preparations Before You Begin Winterization

Before you start draining or insulating anything, proper preparation is key. Gathering your tools and ensuring safety measures are in place makes the winterization process smoother and safer. You do not want to be scrambling for a wrench in the middle of the process. A little foresight goes a long way. This preparatory phase sets the stage for a successful winterization.

First, gather all necessary tools and materials. You will need a bucket, a garden hose, a flathead screwdriver, a Phillips head screwdriver, and possibly pipe insulation or heat tape. Having everything at hand prevents interruptions. It also ensures you complete each step efficiently. Always keep safety as your top priority throughout this process.

Next, locate your tankless water heater's power source. For electric units, find the dedicated circuit breaker in your electrical panel. For gas units, identify the gas shut-off valve near the unit. Turn both off completely. This step prevents the unit from accidentally firing up while you work. It also removes the risk of electrical shock or gas leaks.

You should also turn off the main water supply to your house or, at minimum, the cold water supply valve leading to the tankless water heater. This stops water from entering the unit during the draining process. Once the water supply is off, open any hot water faucets inside your home. This relieves pressure in the lines and helps the unit drain more effectively. It pulls air into the system.

Finally, read your owner's manual. Each tankless water heater model might have specific instructions for draining or winterizing. Your manual will highlight any unique steps or components. Following manufacturer guidelines ensures you do not void your warranty or damage your specific unit. This foundational preparation makes the winterization process much simpler and more effective.

## The Core Process: Draining Your Tankless Water Heater

Draining your tankless water heater is the most crucial step in winterization. This process removes all water from the unit's internal components, preventing ice formation. Even a small amount of residual water can cause significant damage when it freezes. Take your time with this step to ensure thorough drainage.

Begin by locating the service valves on your tankless water heater. Most units have two service valves: one for the hot water outlet and one for the cold water inlet. These valves often have a small cap or a lever. Some units come with a flushing kit already installed, which makes this step easier. If you want to learn more about comprehensive cleaning which often involves draining, you can check out this guide: [how to clean tankless water heater](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-tankless-water-heater).

Connect a garden hose to the drain valve located at the bottom of the cold water inlet service valve. Extend the other end of the hose to a drain or outdoors where water can safely flow away. Make sure the hose is sloped downwards to allow complete drainage. This setup will direct all the water out of your system.

Now, open the drain valve on the cold water inlet service valve. You will hear water begin to flow out through the hose. Next, open the pressure relief valve (T&P valve) if your unit has one. This allows air to enter the unit, helping the water drain faster. Some units may require you to open the hot water service valve as well to allow air in. Consult your manual for the exact procedure for your model.

Allow the unit to drain completely. This may take several minutes, depending on the unit's size and how much water is inside. You will know it is done when the water flow stops or slows to a drip. Once drained, close the drain valve. Then, you can disconnect the hose. It is also a good practice to briefly open a hot water faucet inside your home to ensure all pressure is relieved and any last drops are cleared from the hot water lines.

## Protecting Pipes and Connections from Freezing

Draining your tankless water heater is vital, but protecting the connected pipes is equally important. Water can remain in the supply and return lines, even after the unit is drained. These exposed pipes are highly susceptible to freezing and bursting, leading to significant water damage. Therefore, proper insulation and heat application are critical.

Start by inspecting all water lines connected to your tankless water heater. Pay close attention to any pipes running through unheated areas. This includes crawl spaces, attics, garages, or along exterior walls. These areas are most vulnerable to temperature drops. Identifying these weak points helps you target your protection efforts effectively.

Next, apply pipe insulation sleeves to all exposed water lines. These foam sleeves are inexpensive and easy to install. They create a thermal barrier around the pipes, slowing heat loss. Measure the length of the pipes and cut the insulation to fit snugly. Secure the seams with duct tape or zip ties. Ensure there are no gaps where cold air can penetrate.

For areas prone to extreme cold, or if your pipes are in a particularly exposed location, consider using electric heat tape. Heat tape wraps around pipes and plugs into an electrical outlet, providing a continuous low level of heat. Some heat tapes are self-regulating, turning on only when temperatures drop below a certain threshold. Install heat tape according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure it is rated for outdoor use if applied outside.

Do not forget about the condensate line if your tankless water heater is a condensing model. This line carries acidic wastewater away from the unit. It can also freeze. If the condensate line is exposed, insulate it or use a heat trace cable designed for such lines. A frozen condensate line can cause the unit to shut down or back up, leading to water damage. Taking these steps provides comprehensive protection for your entire hot water system.

## Special Considerations for Outdoor or Unheated Spaces

Tankless water heaters installed outdoors or in unheated spaces like garages and sheds face a much higher risk of freezing. While indoor units benefit from the ambient heat of your home, outdoor units are directly exposed to the elements. Therefore, they require enhanced winterization strategies. Simply draining the unit may not be enough in extreme cold.

For outdoor tankless water heaters, the first line of defense is usually a protective cabinet. Many outdoor units come with integrated freeze protection built into their design. This system often uses a small electric heater to keep the internal components warm. However, if power is lost, this protection becomes useless. Always ensure the cabinet is securely closed and free of gaps that allow cold air ingress.

Insulating the cabinet itself can offer additional protection. You can add foam board insulation to the inside walls of the cabinet. This creates an extra layer of thermal resistance around the unit. Ensure the insulation does not block any vents or impede the unit's operation. Proper airflow is still essential for safe operation.

Another critical area is the water lines leading to and from the outdoor unit. These lines are completely exposed and prone to freezing. I strongly recommend using both pipe insulation and electric heat tape on all exposed pipes. Run the heat tape along the entire length of the pipe and securely attach it. This provides active heating that combats freezing temperatures.

It offers specific advice for these challenging installations.

In some rare cases, for vacation homes or cabins where the unit will be completely shut down for an extended period, professionals might recommend using non-toxic propylene glycol. This food-grade antifreeze can be circulated through the system after draining. However, this is a complex procedure. It should only be performed by a qualified plumber. Never use automotive antifreeze; it is toxic and can severely damage your plumbing system. Consulting a professional for outdoor or complex setups ensures maximum protection.

## Post-Winterization Checklist and Re-commissioning

Once you have completed the winterization steps, it is important to perform a final checklist. This ensures you have not missed anything critical. A thorough check confirms your tankless water heater is fully protected for the cold months ahead. This final verification gives you peace of mind.

Start by double-checking all valves. Make sure the water supply valves leading to the unit are completely closed. Ensure the drain valve on the service port is also closed and the hose is disconnected. Verify that the gas supply valve and the electrical circuit breaker for the unit remain in the "off" position. All these safeguards prevent accidental operation or leaks during the winter months.

Next, visually inspect all insulated pipes and any heat tape you installed. Confirm that insulation sleeves are snug and fully cover the pipes. Check that heat tape is properly secured and, if applicable, plugged into a working outlet. A quick visual scan helps identify any overlooked spots. It ensures your efforts provide full coverage.

When winter is over and you are ready to use your tankless water heater again, you will need to re-commission it. This process involves reversing the steps you took to winterize. First, ensure all drain valves are closed. Then, slowly open the cold water supply valve to the unit. This allows water to begin filling the system. Listen for the sound of water flowing.

Once the unit is full, open a hot water faucet inside your home until a steady stream of water flows without air sputtering. This purges any air from the hot water lines. After the air is out, you can slowly turn on the gas supply valve or flip the electrical circuit breaker back on. The unit should power up and begin its normal operation. Perform a quick check for any leaks around connections. This complete cycle ensures your tankless unit is ready for use again.

## Regular Maintenance Beyond Winterization for Longevity

While winterization protects your tankless water heater from freezing, regular year-round maintenance is essential for its overall longevity and efficiency. Ignoring routine care can lead to mineral buildup, reduced performance, and premature failure. Think of it as a vehicle; regular oil changes keep it running smoothly.

One of the most vital maintenance tasks is flushing or descaling your tankless water heater annually. Hard water contains minerals like calcium and magnesium. These minerals accumulate inside the heat exchanger, forming scale. This scale reduces the unit's efficiency. It forces the heater to work harder to warm water. Eventually, it can cause clogs and damage internal components.

I recommend using a descaling solution or a vinegar-based solution for flushing. This process involves circulating the solution through the unit to dissolve mineral deposits. Many units have specific service ports designed for this purpose. If you are unsure about performing this task yourself, consider hiring a professional plumber. They have the right equipment and expertise. This is a critical step for maintaining performance.

Beyond descaling, periodically check for leaks around connections and pipes. Even small drips can indicate a problem. Address any leaks promptly to prevent water damage and further issues. Also, inspect the air intake and exhaust vents for any obstructions, such as debris, dust, or insect nests. Blocked vents can impair combustion and reduce efficiency.

Regular maintenance helps you identify potential problems early, before they escalate into major repairs. It keeps your tankless water heater running at peak performance, saving you money on energy bills and extending its lifespan. A well-maintained unit is a reliable unit, providing consistent hot water for years to come.
