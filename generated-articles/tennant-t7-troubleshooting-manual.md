The Tennant T7 floor scrubber is a workhorse for many cleaning tasks. It cleans floors in large commercial and industrial spaces. Knowing its main parts helps you troubleshoot problems. The machine cleans using water, solution, and brushes. A vacuum system picks up dirty water.

Key components include the battery, solution tank, and recovery tank. The brush deck holds the scrub brushes. A squeegee assembly collects water from the floor. Vacuum motors create suction. Electrical systems control all these functions. Regular checks of these parts prevent many issues. This understanding is key to using your [Tennant floor scrubber troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/tennant-floor-scrubber-troubleshooting) guide effectively.

### Battery and Charging System

The Tennant T7 uses a battery for power. A fully charged battery ensures the machine works correctly. Low battery power causes many operational problems. Always check battery charge before use. Charge the battery fully after each shift.

Inspect battery terminals for corrosion. Clean terminals if they look dirty. A loose connection can also prevent the machine from starting. Ensure the battery charger works properly. If the charger light does not come on, check its power supply.

### Solution and Recovery Tanks

The solution tank holds clean water and cleaning solution. The recovery tank collects dirty water. Both tanks must be clean and free of debris. A clogged solution filter stops water flow. A full recovery tank can stop vacuum function.

Empty and rinse the recovery tank after every use. Clean the solution tank regularly. This prevents buildup and ensures proper flow. Make sure tank lids are sealed tightly. Loose lids can cause leaks or reduce vacuum power.

## Common Power and Start-Up Problems on the Tennant T7

A Tennant T7 that does not start creates frustration. Power issues are common for any equipment. This section covers steps to fix start-up problems. We discuss battery, fuse, and switch checks. Following these steps helps you get your T7 running.

### Machine Does Not Start or Turn On

If your Tennant T7 has no power, check the battery first. Ensure the battery is fully charged. Low battery voltage is a frequent cause of no-start conditions. Connect the charger and see if the machine charges. Wait a few hours for a full charge.

Next, check the battery cables. They should be tight and clean. Loose or corroded cables stop power flow. Make sure the main power switch is on. Some models have an emergency stop button. Push and release the emergency stop button to reset it.

### Battery Not Holding a Charge

A battery that dies quickly needs attention. First, check the charger output. Use a voltmeter to test charger voltage. If the charger works, the battery might be old. Batteries lose capacity over time. Old batteries cannot hold a full charge.

Extreme temperatures also affect battery life. Store the machine in a moderate climate. Check battery water levels if using lead-acid batteries. Add distilled water as needed. A failing battery needs replacement.

### Machine Shuts Off During Operation

The Tennant T7 might shut down while you use it. This often points to a power issue. The battery might be low. Recharge the battery fully before using the machine again. Overload can also cause shutdowns. Do not push the machine beyond its limits.

Check for loose electrical connections. A vibrating machine can loosen wires. Look for any visible damage to power cords or wiring. If the machine still shuts down, an internal electrical fault might be present. This needs professional help. General equipment like a [True refrigerator troubleshooting manual](https://beacleaner.com/true-refrigerator-troubleshooting-manual) also highlights electrical checks.

## Addressing Poor Cleaning Performance with Your T7

Poor cleaning results mean your Tennant T7 is not doing its job. Streaks, dirty spots, or an unclean floor are signs. This section helps you fix these common cleaning performance issues. We focus on brushes, squeegees, and solution flow.

### Floor Remains Dirty After Scrubbing

If the floor is still dirty, check the brushes. Worn brushes do not scrub effectively. Replace them if the bristles are short or damaged. Ensure the correct brush type is installed for your floor. Different floors need different brushes.

Check brush pressure settings. Too little pressure means brushes do not make good contact. Adjust the pressure to the recommended setting for your floor type. Also, verify that cleaning solution flows to the brushes. A clogged solution line stops cleaning.

### Machine Leaves Streaks or Water Behind

Streaks or standing water mean the squeegee is not working. Inspect the squeegee blades. Worn, cut, or damaged blades cannot pick up water cleanly. Replace both front and rear squeegee blades if damaged. Ensure the squeegee assembly is adjusted correctly. It must touch the floor evenly across its width.

Check for debris caught in the squeegee assembly. Hair, string, or small objects stop water collection. Ensure the vacuum hose is connected properly. A loose hose reduces vacuum suction. Verify the recovery tank is not full. A full tank prevents water pickup.

### Brushes Not Spinning

When the brushes do not spin, cleaning cannot happen. First, check if the brush motor is engaged. Ensure the brush control switch is on. Look for any obstructions under the brush deck. Debris can jam the brushes. Remove anything blocking their rotation.

Check the brush drive belt or direct drive mechanism. A broken belt or damaged gear prevents spinning. If the motor hums but brushes do not turn, the motor might be faulty. Electrical connections to the brush motor should be secure. Problems with other mechanical systems, such as a [Speed Queen washer troubleshooting manual](https://beacleaner.com/speed-queen-washer-troubleshooting-manual), often point to similar motor or belt issues.

## Troubleshooting Water and Solution System Issues on the Tennant T7

The water and solution system is vital for cleaning. Problems here lead to no solution, leaks, or overflowing tanks. This section guides you through fixing common water system faults. We cover solution flow, leaks, and tank problems.

### No Solution Dispensing to Brushes

If no cleaning solution reaches the brushes, check the solution tank first. Ensure it has enough water and solution. The solution filter might be clogged. Clean or replace the filter. A blocked filter stops liquid flow.

Inspect the solution hose for kinks or blockages. Make sure the solution valve is open. Some machines have a flow control knob; verify it is set correctly. The solution pump might be faulty if all else checks out. A non-working pump cannot move liquid.

### Machine Leaks Water

Water leaks waste solution and create hazards. Find the source of the leak. Check the solution tank lid. A loose or damaged lid can drip water. Inspect all hoses for cracks or loose connections. Tighten hose clamps if they are loose.

The drain hose for the recovery tank might be open or damaged. Ensure the drain cap is secure. Squeegee blade adjustment can also cause leaks if water is not picked up fully. Check the recovery tank float shut-off. If it sticks, the tank can overflow during vacuuming.

### Recovery Tank Overflows

An overflowing recovery tank is a sign of a vacuum system problem. The recovery tank float ball might be stuck. This ball rises with water level and stops the vacuum when the tank is full. If it sticks, the machine does not stop vacuuming. Clean the float ball and its cage.

The vacuum hose could be clogged. Debris in the hose slows water movement to the tank. Remove the vacuum hose and check for obstructions. Ensure the vacuum motor is working properly. A weak vacuum motor cannot pull water fast enough.

## Resolving Brush and Squeegee Assembly Problems

The brushes and squeegee do the main work of cleaning. Issues with these parts directly affect performance. This section helps you fix common problems related to brush and squeegee assemblies. Proper function ensures a clean, dry floor.

### Brushes Not Engaging or Lifting

When the brushes do not engage, check the brush control lever or switch. Ensure it is in the "down" or "on" position. Obstructions can prevent the brush deck from lowering fully. Look for debris under the machine. Clear any items blocking movement.

The brush lift motor or actuator might have a fault. If you hear a click but no movement, the motor might be jammed. Check electrical connections to the brush lift mechanism. A bent brush plate or worn bearings can also prevent proper engagement. [Tennant floor scrubber troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/tennant-floor-scrubber-troubleshooting) guides often detail these mechanical checks.

### Squeegee Not Picking Up Water Evenly

Uneven water pickup leaves wet streaks. This points to a squeegee problem. The squeegee blades might be worn unevenly. Rotate or replace the blades. Always use genuine Tennant blades for best results. Blades should be flexible and clean.

Check the squeegee assembly adjustment. The squeegee wheels or adjustment bolts set blade pressure. Ensure the entire length of the blade touches the floor with light pressure. Look for debris stuck to the squeegee. A piece of string or dirt can lift a blade section.

### Loud Noises from Brushes or Squeegee

Unusual noises from the brush area suggest an issue. A grinding noise might mean worn brush bearings. Replace worn brushes. If you hear a squealing noise, check the drive belt (if applicable) for tension. A loose belt can slip.

A chattering squeegee means it is not gliding smoothly. Check for worn blades or improper adjustment. The floor might be too rough for the current blade type. Ensure the squeegee wheels are clean and roll freely. Damaged squeegee wheels can cause uneven pressure and noise.
