## Understanding Mold Testing and Its Purpose

Mold is a type of fungus. It grows in damp places. You often find it in basements, bathrooms, or near leaky pipes. Mold can appear as fuzzy patches of black, green, or white. Sometimes, you smell it before you see it. It creates a musty, earthy odor.

Testing for mold is a good idea when you suspect its presence. Maybe you had a water leak. You might notice a musty smell in a certain room. Some people develop allergy-like symptoms, which can also signal mold. These symptoms include sneezing, coughing, or itchy eyes.

Mold testing helps you confirm if mold is present. It also helps identify the type of mold. Knowing the type can guide your next steps. It helps determine if professional remediation is needed. Testing does not measure health risks, but it confirms mold activity.

Several types of mold tests exist. Air sampling checks for spores in the air. Surface sampling tests visible mold or suspected growth areas. I always advise people to consider a test if they have any doubt. It brings peace of mind or helps you act quickly.

## Key Features of Top Mold Test Kits in 2017

In 2017, consumers sought specific qualities in mold test kits. Accuracy was a primary concern. People wanted kits that gave reliable results. They needed to trust the information they received. Ease of use was also very important. Most users were not mold experts.

Kits had to be simple to operate. Clear instructions made the process straightforward. Many top kits offered a lab analysis option. This feature was crucial. It meant a professional looked at the samples. This added a layer of accuracy and authority to the findings.

Cost effectiveness also played a role. People wanted an affordable way to check their homes. They balanced cost with the quality of results. The best kits offered a good value for the money. They provided peace of mind without a large expense.

Top kits often included different sample types. Some focused on air quality. Others allowed surface swabbing. This versatility was a benefit. It let users choose the best method for their situation. These features combined made a kit stand out in 2017.

## Top Picks: The Best Mold Test Kits of 2017 Reviewed

In 2017, several types of mold test kits were popular. These kits served different needs. Some were great for finding mold you could not see. Others helped confirm mold you already suspected. Each type had its own benefits and uses.

Homeowners generally looked for convenience and reliable results. They wanted a kit that was easy to use. They also expected accurate lab analysis after sending in their samples. Let us explore the popular types that stood out in 2017.

### Air Sampling Kits

Air sampling kits were very popular. These kits aimed to detect airborne mold spores. You would expose a petri dish or an air pump for a set time. This captured spores floating in the air. This method was good for general indoor air quality checks.

People used these kits when they smelled mold but saw no visible growth. It helped find hidden mold sources. The kit then typically included instructions to send the sample to a lab. The lab would identify specific mold types and their concentrations. This gave users a clear picture of their indoor air.

### Surface Swab/Lift Kits

Surface swab or lift kits provided direct testing. You would use a sterile swab or tape strip. You rubbed it on a suspected mold area. This method was best for visible mold. It helped confirm if a suspicious spot was indeed mold.

These kits were simple to use. They were good for specific areas. Think about a dark spot on a wall or ceiling. After taking the sample, you sent it to a lab. The lab then identified the mold species present. This helped decide on appropriate cleaning or remediation steps.

You can learn more about professional lab analysis. This includes knowing how to use the kits for best results. [How to Use a Pro-Lab Mold Test Kit](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-use-a-pro-lab-mold-test-kit) offers detailed steps.

### Settling Plate Kits

Settling plate kits were another common type. These kits used a petri dish with a growth medium. You opened the dish and left it exposed to the air for a few hours. Airborne mold spores would land on the medium. The dish was then sealed and incubated.

After incubation, mold colonies would grow on the plate. This gave a visual indication of mold presence. For specific identification, you still needed to send the plate to a lab. This type of kit offered a simple initial screen. It helped homeowners decide if further action was necessary.

## How to Use Your 2017 Mold Test Kit Effectively

Using a mold test kit correctly is very important. It ensures you get accurate results. First, read all instructions carefully. Each kit has specific steps. Do not skip any part of the process. This helps avoid errors.

Choose the right location for testing. If you smell mold, test that area. If you see discoloration, test that spot. For general air quality, pick a central room. Always follow the kit's recommended exposure time. Too short or too long can affect results.

Avoid cross-contamination. Use clean hands or gloves. Do not touch the sample surface or petri dish directly. Seal the samples immediately after collection. Proper sealing prevents new mold spores from entering. It also stops existing spores from escaping.

Finally, mail your samples to the lab promptly. Do not leave them sitting for days. Fresh samples give the most accurate readings. The lab report will provide the specific details you need. This report is your key to understanding the mold situation.

## Interpreting Mold Test Results and Next Steps

Once you send your mold samples, you wait for the lab report. This report is crucial. It tells you if mold is present. It also identifies the type of mold. Sometimes, it even gives a count of mold spores. Do not panic when you see the results.

Mold is everywhere in our environment. A low level of mold spores is normal. The report helps you understand what is an acceptable level. It highlights specific mold types. Some mold types are more common indoors than others. Others might suggest a hidden water problem.

If the report indicates high mold levels, action is needed. You must find the source of moisture. Fix any leaks right away. Then, clean the affected areas. Small mold patches can often be cleaned yourself. For larger areas, call a professional.

Never ignore high mold test results. Act quickly to prevent further growth. Addressing the root cause is most important. This usually means stopping the water source. Then, remove or clean contaminated materials.

After you have fixed the moisture issue and cleaned small areas, you might want to retest. This confirms your efforts were successful. If you find mold in certain spots like a bathroom, cleaning immediately is vital. For guidance, consider how to clean [bathroom mold](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bathroom-mold) effectively. If the mold is on porous surfaces, sometimes cleaning with a strong solution is needed, like when you clean [mold off concrete](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-concrete). For specific surfaces, knowing how to clean [mold off walls](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-walls) or even from your [dishwasher](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-in-dishwasher) can be helpful.

## Beyond Testing: Preventing Mold Growth at Home

Testing is the first step. Preventing mold is an ongoing process. You want to stop mold from returning. Moisture control is the most important factor. Mold needs water to grow. Fix any leaks as soon as possible. Check pipes under sinks regularly. Look for roof leaks, too.

Ventilation helps a lot. Use exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens. Open windows when the weather permits. Good airflow reduces humidity. This makes it harder for mold to thrive. Consider using a dehumidifier in damp areas like basements. Keep humidity levels below 60%.

Regular cleaning also prevents mold. Wipe down damp surfaces. Clean shower walls and curtains often. Use mold-inhibiting cleaning products. Pay attention to areas prone to moisture. These include window sills and refrigerator drip pans. Cleaning mold with common household items like vinegar can be effective for small areas; you can find tips on [how to clean mold with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-with-vinegar). For specific areas like under your sink, a common spot for leaks, knowing [how to clean mold under sink](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-under-sink) is very useful.

Do not let wet items sit around. Dry clothes promptly after washing. Wipe up spills immediately. These simple habits make a big difference. They help keep your home mold-free and healthy. Staying proactive beats reacting to a large mold problem.
