### Why would a housebroken dog start pooping in the house?

A housebroken dog starts pooping in the house due to medical problems, stress, changes in routine or environment, or a breakdown in their training. This behavior is rarely done out of spite. It is usually a symptom of a deeper issue needing investigation.

## Medical Reasons for Indoor Accidents

When a housebroken dog starts pooping in the house, a health problem is often the primary reason. Dogs cannot tell us they feel sick. They show symptoms through changes in behavior. An accident indoors could be a clear sign of discomfort or illness.

We always recommend a vet visit first. This visit can rule out or confirm underlying medical conditions. Your vet can perform tests to check your dog's health. Identifying a medical cause is a crucial first step.

### Gastrointestinal Problems

Gastrointestinal issues can cause a dog to lose control of their bowels. Conditions like inflammatory bowel disease or pancreatitis make it hard for dogs to hold their stool. Diarrhea or frequent urges may lead to accidents. They might not be able to wait until you let them outside. Even a minor stomach upset can trigger an accident indoors.

### Parasites and Infections

Intestinal parasites, such as worms, can cause severe digestive upset. These parasites irritate the intestines. This leads to diarrhea and increased frequency of bowel movements. Bacterial or viral infections can also inflame the digestive tract. This makes it difficult for a dog to control their eliminations. Regular deworming and proper hygiene help prevent these issues.

### Metabolic Diseases

Certain metabolic diseases affect a dog's overall health. Conditions like kidney disease or liver disease can impact their digestion. These diseases may cause increased thirst and urination, and sometimes lead to changes in bowel habits. They might also weaken muscles, making it harder for dogs to hold stool. Your vet will check for these systemic issues during an exam.

### Neurological Conditions

Neurological problems can affect a dog's ability to control their body functions. Diseases that impact the spine or brain may disrupt nerve signals. These signals tell the dog when and where to eliminate. Older dogs are more prone to degenerative neurological conditions. This can result in fecal incontinence. They simply may not feel the urge or lose control suddenly.

### Age-Related Incontinence

As dogs get older, their bodies change. Muscles can weaken, including those that control the bladder and bowels. Cognitive decline, similar to dementia in humans, also plays a role. An aging dog might forget their house training rules. They might also not be able to hold it as long as before. This is a common and sad part of aging for many dogs. Understanding this can help you provide more frequent potty breaks and management. If your older dog starts having accidents, it's worth discussing with your vet. They can suggest ways
