## How to Clean Yeezy 700: The Ultimate Guide

Your Yeezy 700 sneakers are more than just shoes. They are a statement piece, a blend of comfort and style. Like any prized possession, they need proper care to keep them looking fresh. Dirt, mud, and daily wear can dull their appearance. Learning how to clean Yeezy 700 shoes correctly helps them last longer. I often get asked the best ways to restore these unique sneakers. This guide will walk you through every step. We will cover necessary tools, techniques for different materials, and common mistakes to avoid. Get ready to bring your Yeezy 700s back to life.

### Takeaway

Cleaning your Yeezy 700s keeps them looking new. Here are the key steps:

*   **Pre-clean:** Remove laces and dry brush loose dirt.
*   **Prepare solution:** Mix a mild cleaner with water.
*   **Brush gently:** Use different brushes for mesh, suede, and Boost.
*   **Wipe clean:** Use a microfiber cloth to remove dirt and soap.
*   **Air dry:** Let shoes dry naturally away from direct heat.
*   **Protect:** Apply a shoe protector spray after cleaning.

To clean your Yeezy 700s, first remove laces and dry brush loose dirt. Then, use a mild cleaning solution and soft brushes to scrub all parts, including mesh, suede, and the Boost sole. Wipe away dirt with a microfiber cloth and let the shoes air dry completely.

### Understanding Your Yeezy 700 Materials

Before you start to clean Yeezy 700 sneakers, you must know their parts. Different materials need specific cleaning methods. Your Yeezy 700s combine several surfaces. These include primeknit mesh, premium suede, and some leather overlays. The distinctive Boost sole unit is also a key feature.

The mesh parts are usually soft and breathable. They can trap dirt easily. Suede is delicate and can get wet spots if not cleaned correctly. Leather accents are more durable but still need care. The thick Boost midsole gets dirty fast because of its textured surface. The rubber outsole is tough but collects grime. Knowing each material helps you choose the right tools. It also guides your cleaning technique. This prevents damage and ensures a deep clean.

### Gathering Your Yeezy 700 Cleaning Tools

Having the right tools makes cleaning your Yeezy 700s simple. You do not need many items, but the correct ones matter. A soft-bristle brush is important for delicate materials like suede and mesh. A medium-bristle brush works well for the Boost sole. You will also need a cleaning solution made for sneakers.

I always keep a few microfiber towels ready. They are great for wiping and drying. A bowl of clean water is essential for rinsing. An old toothbrush can help clean small crevices. Shoe trees help keep the shoe shape as it dries. These basic items will prepare you for an effective cleaning session. You can find specialized [shoe cleaning kits](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes) if you prefer.

*   **Soft-bristle brush:** Gentle on suede and mesh.
*   **Medium-bristle brush:** Effective for the Boost sole and outsole.
*   **Sneaker cleaning solution:** Choose a mild, non-toxic formula.
*   **Microfiber towels:** For wiping and drying.
*   **Bowl of clean water:** For rinsing brushes and cloth.
*   **Old toothbrush:** For tough spots and small areas.
*   **Shoe trees or crumpled paper:** To maintain shoe shape during drying.
*   **Protective spray:** For post-clean protection.

### Basic Steps to Clean Yeezy 700 Exteriors

Starting with a basic clean removes most surface dirt. This step is important before you deep clean Yeezy 700s. First, take out the laces. You can clean these separately later. Use a dry soft brush to brush off loose dirt and debris. Make sure to get into all grooves. This prevents mud from turning into stains when wet.

Next, mix your cleaning solution with water in a bowl. Follow the cleaner's instructions for the right ratio. Dip your soft brush into the solution. Gently scrub the mesh and leather areas. Use light, circular motions. Wipe away dirty foam with a clean microfiber towel. Repeat until these parts look clean. This basic method helps maintain your shoes regularly.

*   **Remove laces:** Take laces out to clean them separately.
*   **Dry brush:** Use a soft, dry brush to remove loose dirt from the entire shoe.
*   **Prepare solution:** Mix sneaker cleaning solution with water as directed.
*   **Light scrub:** Dip soft brush in solution and gently scrub mesh and leather.
*   **Wipe down:** Use a clean microfiber towel to wipe off dirt and excess solution.

### Deep Cleaning Different Yeezy 700 Components

After the basic clean, focus on specific materials. Each part of your Yeezy 700 needs special attention. This is where you really make your shoes shine. I find that treating each material separately gives the best results.

#### Cleaning the Suede Panels

Suede is delicate, so be extra careful here. Do not saturate the suede with water or cleaning solution. Use a soft-bristle brush, perhaps one made for suede. Dip the brush lightly into your cleaning solution. Gently brush the suede in one direction. This lifts the dirt without damaging the nap. If the suede gets too wet, it can stiffen or leave water spots. Wipe immediately with a dry microfiber cloth. If you have other Yeezy models with suede, like the Yeezy 500, similar rules apply.

#### Reviving the Mesh Sections

The mesh areas on your Yeezy 700 can trap a lot of dust. Use a soft or medium-bristle brush for these parts. Dip the brush in your diluted cleaning solution. Scrub the mesh using gentle circles. Pay attention to the areas around the laces and toes. These spots gather the most dirt. Rinse your brush often to avoid spreading dirt. Wipe the mesh clean with a damp microfiber cloth.

#### Caring for Leather Details

Yeezy 700s have some leather overlays, depending on the colorway. These are usually easier to clean. Use a soft brush or simply a clean cloth dipped in your cleaning solution. Wipe the leather gently. Do not scrub hard, as this can wear down the finish. After cleaning, wipe the leather dry with another clean cloth.

#### Scrubbing the Boost Sole and Rubber Outsole

The Boost midsole is often white and gets dirty fast. The rubber outsole touches the ground, so it collects grime. For these tough areas, use a medium-bristle brush. Apply more pressure here than on the upper. Dip your brush in the cleaning solution. Scrub the Boost sole and outsole vigorously. You might need to repeat this a few times for deep stains. Rinse the brush and wipe the sole clean with a damp cloth. For other Yeezy 700 variations, such as the Yeezy 700 MNVN, the Boost sole cleaning process is very similar.

### Removing Stubborn Stains from Yeezy 700

Sometimes, a basic clean is not enough for tough stains. Mud, oil, or scuffs can be hard to remove from your Yeezy 700s. I often see people get frustrated with these marks. But with the right approach, you can tackle them.

For mud, let it dry completely first. Then, gently scrape off the dry mud with a dull knife or brush. After that, use your cleaning solution as described. For oil stains, a small amount of dish soap mixed with water can help. Apply it directly to the stain with a soft brush. Gently rub and then rinse. Remember to use a clean cloth to blot the area dry. Scuff marks on the Boost sole or rubber outsole might need a bit more force. A Mr. Clean Magic Eraser can work wonders on these surfaces. Test it on a small, hidden area first. Always wipe thoroughly after treating any stain to remove all residue.

### Caring for Yeezy 700 Laces and Interiors

Cleaning the outside of your Yeezy 700s is only half the job. Laces and interiors need attention too. Dirty laces make clean shoes look incomplete. The inside of your shoes can hold odors and dirt.

For laces, you can put them in a mesh laundry bag. Then, machine wash them on a delicate cycle with mild detergent. I prefer to hand wash them in a bowl with warm water and a little soap. Scrub them gently and then rinse well. Let them air dry. For the insoles, pull them out. You can scrub them with your cleaning solution and a brush. Rinse them under the tap and let them air dry completely. For the shoe's interior, spray a fabric freshener inside. You can also sprinkle baking soda inside and let it sit overnight. Vacuum or shake out the baking soda the next day. This helps remove odors.

### Drying and Protecting Your Clean Yeezy 700

Drying your Yeezy 700s properly is as important as cleaning them. Incorrect drying can ruin your hard work. Always air dry your shoes. Do not put them in a dryer or use direct heat. High heat can damage the materials and adhesives. It can also warp the shoe's shape.

Place your cleaned Yeezy 700s in a well-ventilated area. Sunlight can cause yellowing, especially on white Boost soles, so avoid direct sun. Stuff the shoes with crumpled paper towels or shoe trees. This helps absorb moisture and keeps the shoe's shape. Change the paper towels if they get too wet. Allow at least 24 hours for them to dry completely. Once dry, consider applying a shoe protection spray. This repels water and stains. It makes future cleaning much easier.

### When to Seek Professional Yeezy 700 Cleaning Services

Most Yeezy 700 cleaning tasks you can do at home. However, some situations call for professional help. Knowing when to get professional help saves your shoes. If your shoes have deep-set stains that you cannot remove, consider a pro. This includes oil, paint, or chemical spills.

Delicate materials like very light suede can be tricky. Professionals have specialized tools and solutions for these. They also know how to treat rare or expensive pairs. If your shoes have signs of damage, like loose stitching, a professional can assess them. They might offer repair services along with cleaning. For really tough situations, a professional sneaker cleaner is your best option. They can often restore shoes you thought were beyond saving.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Yeezy 700

Cleaning your Yeezy 700s is simple if you avoid common errors. Many people make these mistakes, leading to damage. I always warn against using harsh chemicals. Bleach or strong detergents can discolor or ruin materials. Stick to mild, sneaker-specific cleaners.

Another big mistake is putting your Yeezy 700s in a washing machine. The machine's agitation and heat can break down glue and damage the shoe's structure. Always hand wash them. Do not dry your shoes in direct sunlight or with a hairdryer. This can cause yellowing on the Boost sole. It can also shrink or warp the upper. Using the wrong brush is another pitfall. Hard bristles can scratch suede or tear mesh. Always use soft brushes on delicate areas. Not separating laces or insoles before cleaning is also a common oversight. Proper cleaning means giving attention to all parts. For insights on cleaning other Yeezy models like the V3, check out [how to clean Yeezy 700 V3.](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-yeezy-700-v3)

*   **Using harsh chemicals:** Avoid bleach, strong detergents, or household cleaners not made for shoes.
*   **Machine washing:** Never put Yeezy 700s in a washing machine or dryer.
*   **Direct heat drying:** Do not use hairdryers, radiators, or direct sunlight to dry shoes.
*   **Using wrong brushes:** Hard bristles can damage suede or mesh.
*   **Not separating parts:** Always remove laces and insoles for separate cleaning.
*   **Oversaturating materials:** Especially with suede, too much water can cause damage.

### Maintaining Your Yeezy 700's Freshness

Regular maintenance keeps your Yeezy 700s looking great. It also means less deep cleaning later. I suggest a quick clean after every few wears. This prevents dirt from building up. Use a dry brush to remove loose dust and dirt daily. Wipe down the Boost sole with a damp cloth if it looks smudged.

Store your Yeezy 700s in a cool, dry place. Keep them out of direct sunlight. Shoe trees help maintain their shape when not in use. Rotate your shoes regularly. Do not wear the same pair every day. This gives them time to air out. Applying a protective spray every few months helps too. This layer prevents stains and water damage. These simple habits extend the life and look of your beloved Yeezy 700s. Just like [Yeezy 350s](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-yeezy-350) or even [Yeezy Slides](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-yeezy-slides), consistent care makes a big difference.
