## Cleaning Plastic Birkenstocks: A Simple Guide

Plastic Birkenstocks are a popular choice. They are known for their comfort and durability. Many people call them EVA Birkenstocks. They are different from the classic leather or suede versions. These sandals are waterproof and lightweight. This makes them perfect for beach trips, pool days, or simply everyday wear. However, even plastic sandals need regular cleaning to stay fresh and last long. Keeping them clean prevents dirt buildup and unpleasant odors. A proper cleaning routine extends the life of your favorite footwear.

I know you want your plastic Birkenstocks to look their best. This guide shows you exactly how to clean plastic Birkenstocks effectively. We will cover everything from quick washes to deep cleaning methods. You will learn how to handle stubborn stains and lingering smells. By the end, your sandals will feel and look like new. Let us get your plastic Birkenstocks sparkling clean.

### Takeaway

*   **Quick Clean:** Rinse with water and mild soap for daily dirt.
*   **Deep Clean:** Use a soft brush, warm water, and dish soap for grime.
*   **Odor Removal:** Soak in a baking soda solution or use white vinegar.
*   **Stain Treatment:** Target specific stains with appropriate gentle cleaners.
*   **Proper Drying:** Air dry away from direct heat to prevent damage.

Plastic Birkenstocks are easy to clean. You can wash them with mild soap and water. Use a soft brush for scrubbing. Rinse them thoroughly. Then, allow them to air dry completely. This process helps remove dirt, grime, and odors. It keeps your sandals fresh and extends their life.

## Understanding Your Plastic Birkenstocks (EVA Material)

Your plastic Birkenstocks are made from a material called EVA. EVA stands for Ethylene-vinyl acetate. This material is a type of foam. It offers many benefits for footwear. EVA makes the sandals incredibly light. They are also flexible and shock-absorbent. These features make them very comfortable to wear.

One of the best qualities of EVA is its waterproof nature. Unlike traditional Birkenstocks, you can get these sandals wet without worry. This makes them ideal for summer activities. They are also very easy to maintain. The non-porous surface of EVA resists dirt absorption. This means stains often sit on the surface. They do not soak deeply into the material. This makes cleaning plastic Birkenstocks a simple task.

However, even with their durability, EVA sandals can collect dirt. Foot sweat and environmental grime can build up. This leads to a dull appearance and sometimes odors. Regular cleaning keeps your EVA Birkenstocks looking good. It also ensures they remain hygienic. I find that understanding the material helps with the cleaning process. Knowing what your sandals are made of guides you in choosing the right cleaning methods.

EVA is also known for being gentle on the skin. It does not cause irritation. It is a safe material for footwear. Its closed-cell structure also means it does not absorb water. This prevents mildew and mold growth inside the sandal. This is a big advantage for sandals worn in wet environments. Regular cleaning helps maintain these benefits. It keeps the material clean and odor-free.

## Essential Supplies for Cleaning Plastic Birkenstocks

Before you start cleaning, gather your supplies. You do not need many special items. Most of what you need is likely already in your home. Having everything ready makes the cleaning process smooth. It saves you time and effort. I always make sure I have my tools before I begin.

Here is a list of basic supplies that work well for plastic Birkenstocks:

*   **Mild Dish Soap:** This is gentle yet effective. It cuts through grease and dirt. Avoid harsh chemical cleaners. Strong chemicals can damage the EVA material. I prefer a gentle, unscented dish soap.
*   **Soft Brush or Old Toothbrush:** A soft brush helps scrub away dirt without scratching. An old toothbrush is perfect for tight spots. It can reach crevices in the footbed. I use one specifically for cleaning tasks.
*   **Clean Cloths or Sponges:** These are good for wiping and rinsing. Microfiber cloths work well. They absorb water and trap dirt.
*   **Warm Water:** Warm water helps loosen dirt. It also helps activate the soap. Do not use hot water. Extreme heat can warp the EVA material.
*   **Baking Soda (Optional):** This is excellent for odor absorption. It is a natural deodorizer. I use it for lingering smells.
*   **White Vinegar (Optional):** Vinegar helps with tough stains and odors. It is also a mild disinfectant. It works well on plastic surfaces. You can learn more about cleaning various plastic items here: [How to Clean Plastic Shower](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-plastic-shower).

Remember, simplicity is key. You do not need fancy products. These basic supplies are effective and safe for your plastic Birkenstocks. They will help you achieve great results.

## Step-by-Step Guide to a Quick Clean

A quick clean is perfect for daily dirt and light grime. It is a simple process. I do this regularly to keep my Birkenstocks looking neat. This method is fast and easy. It prevents dirt from building up over time. This keeps your sandals fresh between deeper cleans.

Here is how you can perform a quick clean on your plastic Birkenstocks:

1.  **Rinse Your Sandals:** Start by rinsing your Birkenstocks under cool or lukewarm running water. This removes loose dirt and debris. I usually do this outside with a hose or in a utility sink. Make sure to rinse both the top and bottom.
2.  **Apply Mild Soap:** Put a few drops of mild dish soap onto a damp cloth or sponge. You do not need much. A small amount goes a long way.
3.  **Gently Wipe:** Gently wipe down the entire surface of the sandals. Pay attention to the footbed and straps. These areas collect the most dirt. I use circular motions to lift the grime.
4.  **Use a Soft Brush for Footbed (Optional):** If the footbed has some light scuff marks or dirt, use a soft brush. A toothbrush works well for this. Lightly scrub the textured surface. This helps dislodge embedded dirt.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the sandals completely under running water again. Make sure all soap residue washes away. Soap left behind can attract more dirt. It can also irritate your feet.
6.  **Shake Off Excess Water:** Give your sandals a good shake. This removes most of the standing water. It speeds up the drying process.
7.  **Air Dry:** Place your Birkenstocks in a well-ventilated area. Let them air dry completely. Avoid direct sunlight or heat sources. These can warp the EVA material.

This quick cleaning method is great for everyday maintenance. It keeps your plastic Birkenstocks looking clean and extends their life. It is an easy habit to adopt.

## Deep Cleaning Plastic Birkenstocks for Tougher Grime

Sometimes your plastic Birkenstocks need more than a quick rinse. They can accumulate stubborn grime, sweat, and odors. A deep clean restores them to their original freshness. This method requires a bit more effort. However, it delivers excellent results. I typically do a deep clean every few weeks. This depends on how often I wear them.

Follow these steps for a thorough deep clean:

1.  **Initial Rinse:** Rinse your sandals under lukewarm water. This helps remove loose dirt. It prepares the surface for scrubbing.
2.  **Prepare Cleaning Solution:** Fill a basin or bucket with warm water. Add a generous amount of mild dish soap. You want enough suds to clean effectively. I use about a tablespoon of soap per gallon of water.
3.  **Soak the Sandals (Optional):** For very dirty sandals, let them soak in the soapy water for 10-15 minutes. This helps loosen caked-on dirt. Do not soak for too long.
4.  **Scrub Thoroughly:** Dip your soft brush or old toothbrush into the soapy water. Begin scrubbing all surfaces of the Birkenstocks.
    *   **Footbed:** Pay extra attention to the footbed. Dirt and oils from your feet accumulate here. Scrub the textured areas well.
    *   **Straps:** Clean both the top and underside of the straps.
    *   **Sides and Soles:** Do not forget the sides and the bottom soles. These areas pick up a lot of external grime.
    *   For general stains on plastic, you can use similar techniques. Check out this guide for more tips: [How to Clean Stains on Plastic](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stains-on-plastic).
5.  **Address Crevices:** Use a toothbrush to get into the small crevices. These areas are hard to reach with a larger brush. Dirt often hides in these spots.
6.  **Rinse Completely:** Rinse the sandals under running lukewarm water. Ensure all soap residue is gone. Squeeze the straps gently to remove water.
7.  **Shake and Air Dry:** Shake off excess water. Place the sandals in a well-ventilated area to air dry completely. Do not use a dryer or direct sunlight.

This deep cleaning method will make your plastic Birkenstocks look and feel much better. It removes accumulated grime and keeps them hygienic. This process is very effective.

## Removing Stubborn Stains and Odors from Plastic Birkenstocks

Sometimes, dirt and sweat lead to stubborn problems. Your plastic Birkenstocks might develop persistent stains or unpleasant odors. Regular cleaning might not be enough for these issues. Special attention helps tackle them. I have dealt with these problems many times.

Here is how to remove tough stains and lingering odors:

### For Stubborn Stains:

*   **Baking Soda Paste:** Mix baking soda with a little water to form a paste. Apply the paste directly onto the stain. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Gently scrub with a soft brush. Then rinse thoroughly. Baking soda is a mild abrasive and helps lift stains.
*   **White Vinegar:** For darker stains or mildew, white vinegar works wonders. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Apply the solution to the stained area. Let it sit for a few minutes. Scrub with a brush and rinse. Vinegar is acidic and helps break down many types of stains. It also kills mold and mildew. If you have mold on plastic, learn more here: [How to Clean Mold Off Plastic](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-plastic).
*   **Rubbing Alcohol (for ink/scuffs):** For ink marks or scuffs, dab a small amount of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton ball. Gently wipe the stain. Rinse the area quickly afterward. Test this in an inconspicuous spot first. This helps ensure it does not affect the plastic's color. For sharpie or ink stains, this guide might offer more details: [How to Clean Sharpie Off Plastic](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-sharpie-off-plastic).
*   **Magic Eraser:** A Melamine foam eraser (like a Magic Eraser) can remove many scuff marks and surface stains. Dampen the eraser and gently rub the affected area. This works by acting as a very fine abrasive.

### For Lingering Odors:

*   **Baking Soda Soak:** Fill a basin with lukewarm water. Add half a cup of baking soda. Stir to dissolve. Submerge your plastic Birkenstocks in the solution for a few hours or overnight. Baking soda neutralizes odors. After soaking, scrub gently and rinse.
*   **White Vinegar Rinse:** After cleaning, you can do a final rinse with a diluted white vinegar solution (1 part vinegar to 4 parts water). Soak the sandals for 10-15 minutes. The vinegar kills odor-causing bacteria. Rinse thoroughly with plain water afterward to remove the vinegar smell.
*   **Sunlight Exposure (Brief):** After cleaning and rinsing, place the clean, damp sandals in a sunny spot for a short period. Sunlight can help sanitize and further reduce odors. Do not leave them too long. Excessive sun can damage the EVA.
*   **Activated Charcoal Pouches:** Place small activated charcoal pouches inside your dry Birkenstocks when not in use. These absorb moisture and odors over time. This is a preventative measure.

Always ensure you rinse your sandals completely after using any cleaning solution. This prevents residue buildup. These methods help restore your plastic Birkenstocks to a fresh state.

## Drying and Maintaining Your Clean Plastic Birkenstocks

Proper drying is crucial after cleaning your plastic Birkenstocks. Incorrect drying can cause damage. It can warp the EVA material. It can also lead to mildew growth if they remain damp. Maintenance steps ensure your sandals stay clean longer. I always prioritize proper drying for all my footwear.

Here are the best practices for drying and maintaining your plastic Birkenstocks:

### Proper Drying Techniques:

1.  **Shake Off Excess Water:** After rinsing, give each sandal a good shake. This helps remove most of the surface water. It speeds up the drying process.
2.  **Use a Clean Towel:** Gently pat the sandals dry with a clean, absorbent towel. This removes more moisture. It reduces drying time.
3.  **Air Dry in a Well-Ventilated Area:** Place your Birkenstocks in a spot with good air circulation. A shaded outdoor area or indoors near a fan works well.
4.  **Avoid Direct Heat:** Never place your plastic Birkenstocks in direct sunlight for extended periods. Do not use a hairdryer, clothes dryer, or radiator. High heat can cause the EVA to shrink or warp. The material is sensitive to extreme temperatures. This is vital for maintaining the sandal's shape and comfort.
5.  **Allow Complete Drying:** Ensure the sandals are completely dry before wearing them again. This prevents foot odor and mildew. It also keeps your feet comfortable. Drying can take several hours depending on humidity.

### Maintenance Tips for Longevity:

*   **Regular Quick Cleans:** Perform quick rinses after each use, especially if worn in sand or mud. This prevents dirt buildup.
*   **Store Properly:** When not wearing them, store your Birkenstocks in a cool, dry place. Avoid leaving them in a hot car. Extreme temperatures can deform them.
*   **Rotate Footwear:** If you wear your plastic Birkenstocks daily, consider having a second pair. Rotating your sandals allows each pair to fully air out. This reduces wear and tear. It also helps prevent odors.
*   **Address Issues Promptly:** If you notice a stain or smell, clean it right away. Fresh stains are easier to remove. Addressing issues quickly keeps your sandals in good condition.
*   **Protect from Sharp Objects:** While durable, EVA can be cut or punctured. Be mindful of where you step. Avoid walking on sharp debris.

By following these drying and maintenance tips, your plastic Birkenstocks will remain comfortable and look good for a long time. These simple steps make a big difference in the lifespan of your sandals.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Plastic Birkenstocks

Cleaning plastic Birkenstocks is straightforward. However, some common mistakes can damage them. Avoiding these errors ensures your sandals last longer. It also keeps them looking their best. I have learned these lessons over time.

Here are the mistakes you should avoid:

*   **Using Harsh Chemicals:** Avoid strong cleaning agents. Do not use bleach, abrasive cleaners, or solvent-based products. These can degrade the EVA material. They can also strip color. Stick to mild dish soap or natural cleaners like vinegar and baking soda.
*   **Applying Excessive Heat:** Never expose your plastic Birkenstocks to high heat. This includes direct sunlight for too long, clothes dryers, radiators, or hot car interiors. EVA material can shrink, melt, or warp when exposed to extreme temperatures. Always air dry them in a shaded, well-ventilated area.
*   **Using Abrasive Scrub Brushes:** While scrubbing is necessary, use a soft brush. Stiff-bristled brushes or steel wool can scratch the surface of the EVA. This can damage the appearance. It can also create tiny grooves where dirt can hide. A soft brush or an old toothbrush is sufficient.
*   **Soaking for Too Long:** Although a short soak can help loosen grime, do not leave your plastic Birkenstocks submerged for days. Prolonged soaking is not necessary. It can potentially affect the bond between the sole and the footbed. A 10-15 minute soak is usually enough for a deep clean.
*   **Not Rinsing Thoroughly:** Always rinse your sandals completely after cleaning. Leftover soap residue can attract more dirt. It can also leave a film. This film can cause skin irritation or make your sandals feel sticky. Ensure every bit of soap is washed away.
*   **Storing While Damp:** Never store your plastic Birkenstocks if they are still damp. This creates an ideal environment for mildew and unpleasant odors. Always ensure they are completely dry before putting them away.
*   **Neglecting Regular Cleaning:** Waiting until your sandals are extremely dirty makes cleaning harder. Regular quick cleans prevent severe buildup. This maintains hygiene and appearance. Consistent care is simpler than a big cleaning project. For comprehensive Birkenstock care, remember to also clean the inside of your sandals: [How to Clean Inside of Birkenstocks](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-inside-of-birkenstocks).
*   **Using Oil-Based Cleaners:** Plastic Birkenstocks do not benefit from oil-based cleaners or conditioners. These products are for leather or cork. They can leave a greasy residue on EVA. This residue attracts dirt.

Avoiding these common pitfalls helps you keep your plastic Birkenstocks in great shape. Simple care is the key to their longevity and comfort.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Cleaning Plastic Birkenstocks

### Q1: Can I put my plastic Birkenstocks in the washing machine?
**A1:** No, you should not put plastic Birkenstocks in a washing machine. The agitation and potential heat from a washing machine can damage or warp the EVA material. It is better to hand wash them.
