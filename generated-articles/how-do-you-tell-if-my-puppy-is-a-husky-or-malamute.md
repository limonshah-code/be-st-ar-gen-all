## Spotting Differences: Husky vs. Malamute Puppies

Bringing a new puppy home is exciting. If you have a northern breed puppy, you might wonder: is my puppy a Husky or Malamute? These two breeds look similar. They both have thick coats and originate from cold climates. However, knowing the exact breed is important. It helps you understand their needs for care, training, and exercise. We will look at clear ways to tell them apart. This guide focuses on physical traits, temperament, and growth. You can learn to identify your specific puppy.

The goal here is simple: to help you figure out if your furry friend is a Siberian Husky or an Alaskan Malamute. We will cover head shape, coat type, eye color, and tail carriage. We also discuss their distinct personalities. By the end, you will have the knowledge to make an educated guess. You will feel confident about your puppy's breed. This helps you provide the best possible home.

### Takeaway

*   **Size Matters:** Malamute puppies are typically larger and heavier than Husky puppies at every age.
*   **Head Shape:** Malamutes have broader heads and snouts; Huskies have more refined, fox-like faces.
*   **Eye Color:** Huskies can have blue eyes or heterochromia; Malamutes almost always have brown eyes.
*   **Tail Differences:** Husky tails often curve like a sickle; Malamute tails usually plume over their backs.
*   **Coat Texture:** Malamute coats are denser and coarser; Husky coats are generally softer.
*   **Temperament Cues:** Huskies are more energetic and vocal; Malamutes are calmer but still powerful.
*   **Professional Help:** DNA tests or veterinary checks offer the most accurate identification.

To tell if your puppy is a Husky or Malamute, examine its size, head shape, eye color, and tail. Malamutes are generally larger with broader heads and brown eyes. Huskies are smaller, more agile, and can have blue eyes or two different eye colors. Observing their early temperament also provides clues.

### Early Physical Traits: Size and Structure Differences

When trying to figure out if your puppy is a Husky or Malamute, size is a big clue. Malamute puppies are usually noticeably larger than Husky puppies at the same age. Even as young pups, Malamutes show greater bone mass and overall bulk. They have heavier bones and a more robust build. This difference becomes more obvious as they grow.

Husky puppies are often more compact. They have a lighter frame. They look agile and sleek. A young Malamute puppy might already feel heavier when you pick it up. This is compared to a Husky puppy of the same litter. Pay close attention to their weight and height. These measurements help you track their growth. This early size comparison is a strong indicator of their breed.

#### Head Shape and Snout

The shape of your puppy's head and snout can tell you a lot. Alaskan Malamutes have broader heads. Their snouts are more powerful and deeper. They often have a strong, distinct stop where the forehead meets the muzzle. Their skull is wide. This gives them a very powerful appearance.

Siberian Huskies, on the other hand, have more refined heads. Their snouts are narrower. They resemble a fox more closely. The stop is less pronounced. Their head shape is more proportionate to their lighter body build. If your puppy has a wide, sturdy head, it leans towards being a Malamute. A more slender head suggests a Husky.

#### Paw Size and Bone Structure

Examine your puppy's paws. Malamute puppies have large, well-padded paws. These paws are built for traction in snow. They are like natural snowshoes. Their bone structure is thick and sturdy. This supports their heavy build. You will notice their legs look strong and thick. This is even when they are young.

Husky puppies have smaller, more oval-shaped paws. Their bone structure is fine but strong. Their legs are lean and muscular. They are built for endurance and speed. Huskies are runners. Malamutes are power haulers. The size and density of their paws and bones reflect these differences. Remember, a [Giant Alaskan Malamute](https://beacleaner.com/is-there-a-difference-between-a-giant-alaskan-malamute-and-an-alaskan-malamute) will show even more exaggerated size traits. Pay attention to these details for clear identification. You can also monitor their growth over time. This helps confirm your initial observations. Knowing [how long it takes for a Malamute to be fully grown](https://beacleaner.com/how-long-does-it-take-for-a-malamute-to-be-fully-grown) can help you track their development.

### Coat Characteristics: Fur and Coloration Clues

The coat of your puppy offers many clues about its breed. Both Huskies and Malamutes have thick, double coats. This protects them from cold weather. However, there are subtle differences in texture and density. Alaskan Malamutes generally have a coarser and thicker outer coat. Their undercoat is very dense and woolly. This gives them a rugged, shaggy look. Their fur stands off their body.

Siberian Huskies have a softer outer coat. Their undercoat is also dense. But it is less coarse than a Malamute's. Their fur lies a bit flatter against their body. If your puppy's fur feels very plush and stands out, it might be a Malamute. If it feels softer and smoother, it could be a Husky.

#### Coat Density and Length

Malamutes often have longer and denser fur around their neck and shoulders. This creates a "ruff." It provides extra insulation. Their tails are also very well-furred. They look like a fluffy plume. The overall appearance is one of extreme insulation. They are built for very harsh, cold climates.

Huskies also have a thick coat. But it is generally not as long or as dense as a Malamute's. Their fur is built for speed and endurance in cold conditions. They shed a lot, especially seasonally. Malamutes also shed heavily. However, the texture and length differences are important. Consider if your puppy looks like a fluffy bear cub or a sleek, furry runner. Some Huskies can have an unusually long coat, known as a wooly Husky. Understanding [what is the difference between a wooly Husky and an Alaskan Malamute](https://beacleaner.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-wooly-husky-and-an-alaskan-malamute) can help differentiate.

#### Common Color Patterns

Both breeds come in a variety of colors. These include black, white, gray, and red. However, certain patterns are more common or distinct. Malamutes often have solid colors or combinations. These include black and white, red and white, or sable and white. They usually have a natural "mask" on their face. This mask is the same color as their body. It makes their eyes stand out.

Huskies also come in similar colors. But they are known for more intricate facial markings. These markings can include distinct "goggles" around their eyes. They can have a "bar" on their forehead. They might also have a "clover leaf" pattern. These complex facial patterns are more typical of Huskies. Pure white is rare in both but possible. Look at the specific patterns on your puppy's face. This helps determine the breed.

### Eye Color and Ear Set: Distinctive Facial Features

The eyes are often the most striking difference between a Husky and a Malamute puppy. This is one of the easiest ways to tell them apart. Siberian Huskies are famous for their eye color. They can have blue eyes. They can also have brown eyes. Some Huskies even have one blue eye and one brown eye. This condition is called heterochromia. It is a common and distinctive trait for the breed. These unique eye colors are very rare in Malamutes.

Alaskan Malamutes almost always have brown eyes. Their eyes range from light brown to very dark brown. They do not typically have blue eyes. If your puppy has clear blue eyes or two different colored eyes, it is very likely a Husky. If your puppy has only brown eyes, it could be either breed. However, brown eyes are a strong indicator for a Malamute. Learning [what it means when a Husky has two different colored eyes](https://beacleaner.com/what-does-it-mean-when-a-husky-has-two-different-colored-eyes) can provide more insight into Husky traits.

#### Ear Size and Placement

The ears of these puppies also offer clues. Alaskan Malamutes have medium-sized ears. They are set wider apart on their head. Their ears are triangular. They have slightly rounded tips. When alert, their ears stand erect. The wider set gives them a broader facial appearance. This matches their overall head structure.

Siberian Huskies have medium-sized ears too. However, their ears are set higher and closer together on their head. They are also triangular. They have pointed tips. Husky ears stand perfectly erect when alert. The higher placement makes their face look more alert and foxy. It gives them a more refined look. Observe the distance between your puppy's ears. Note their shape and tip. This helps you narrow down the breed.

### Tail Talk: How Tails Reveal Identity

A puppy's tail provides clear indicators of its breed. The way a Husky or Malamute carries its tail differs significantly. This is true even at a young age. Pay close attention to its natural position.

#### Husky Tail Traits

Siberian Husky puppies typically carry their tails in a graceful, sickle curve. This means the tail curves upwards and often slightly over their back. It does not usually curl tightly against the back. When a Husky is relaxed or working, its tail often hangs down. It is often carried low. However, when alert or excited, the tail forms that distinctive upward curve. The tail is usually well-furred. It looks like a brush. The fur on the tail is not as dense or bushy as a Malamute's.

#### Malamute Tail Traits

Alaskan Malamute puppies, on the other hand, carry their tails differently. Their tail usually plumes over their back. It often curls over in a full, fluffy arc. This gives it a "waving plume" appearance. The tail is often carried higher. It does not usually drop much when they are relaxed. The fur on a Malamute's tail is very thick and bushy. It looks like a majestic feather duster. It is generally thicker and more densely furred than a Husky's tail. This is a very reliable distinguishing feature. Look for the way the tail sits naturally. This gives a strong hint to the breed.

### Temperament and Personality: Early Behavioral Indicators

Beyond physical appearance, a puppy's temperament offers strong clues. Both Huskies and Malamutes are intelligent and strong-willed. However, their specific behavioral traits differ. Observing these early on can help with identification.

#### Energy Levels and Playfulness

Siberian Husky puppies are known for their high energy levels. They are often restless. They need a lot of exercise. They love to run and play. They are very active. A Husky puppy will likely be constantly on the go. They will explore every corner. They might even try to climb or jump over things. Their play can be quite boisterous. They are endurance athletes. They thrive on activity.

Alaskan Malamute puppies are also energetic, but in a different way. They are powerful. They have bursts of energy. They are not as hyperactive as Huskies. Malamutes are more about strength and stamina. They enjoy a good play session. But they are often content to rest afterward. They can be more laid-back indoors. They might enjoy a good chew toy more than endless running. Their energy is geared towards pulling and working.

#### Vocalizations and Social Tendencies

Huskies are famous for being vocal. They often howl, whine, and "talk." They are not typically big barkers. But they express themselves with a wide range of sounds. They are very social dogs. They thrive on interaction with people and other dogs. They can be quite mischievous. They need companionship. A Husky puppy might vocalize frequently. They will seek attention from you.

Malamutes are generally quieter than Huskies. They might howl occasionally. They are not as prone to the constant "talking" of a Husky. They are very loyal to their families. They are social. But they can be more independent. They are often described as having a dignified nature. A Malamute puppy might be more reserved. They will still be affectionate. They value their family bond. They might be less inclined to mischievous behavior. Observe how your puppy interacts with you and its environment. Listen to the sounds it makes. These behaviors can provide valuable insights.

### Growth and Development: Puppy Size Predictions

Tracking your puppy's growth is a practical way to determine its breed. Malamutes grow into significantly larger adults than Huskies. This size difference becomes more apparent with each passing month. By monitoring their weight and height, you can see which growth trajectory your puppy is following.

#### Weight and Height Milestones

At 8 weeks old, a Husky puppy might weigh around 8-12 pounds. A Malamute puppy of the same age could already be 15-25 pounds. The difference continues to grow. By 6 months, a Husky might weigh 35-50 pounds. A Malamute could easily be 60-80 pounds or more. Adult male Huskies typically weigh 45-60 pounds and stand 20-23.5 inches tall. Adult male Malamutes usually weigh 75-85 pounds and stand 23-25 inches tall. Females are slightly smaller in both breeds.

Keep a growth chart for your puppy. Record its weight and height regularly. Compare these numbers to typical breed standards. This helps confirm your observations. If your puppy is rapidly gaining significant weight, it points to a Malamute. If its growth is steadier and lighter, it suggests a Husky. Remember, these are averages. Individual puppies can vary. However, the general trend will hold true.

#### Growth Plate Closure

Both breeds reach their full height and weight at different rates. Malamutes tend to grow for a longer period. They might not reach their full size until 18-24 months of age. Huskies typically mature faster. They often reach their full height by 12 months. They fill out by 15-18 months.

Understanding when their growth plates close is important. This affects their physical development. It also impacts when you can introduce more strenuous exercise. Longer growth periods are characteristic of larger breeds like the Malamute. Faster maturation is seen in medium-sized breeds like the Husky. If your puppy continues to gain significant size past its first birthday, it is likely a Malamute. If it plateaus around 12-15 months, it is probably a Husky.

### DNA Testing and Professional Opinion: Definitive Identification

While physical and behavioral observations provide strong clues, sometimes you need a definitive answer. For absolute certainty, professional methods are available. These include DNA testing and expert veterinary assessment.

#### Veterinary Assessment

Your veterinarian is an excellent resource. They have extensive knowledge of dog breeds. They can evaluate your puppy's physical traits. They will look at bone structure, coat, and general conformation. A vet can often give you a very educated guess. They might point out subtle differences that you missed. They can also assess your puppy's overall health. This ensures your puppy is thriving regardless of breed.

A vet can check for common breed-specific health issues. For example, Huskies are prone to certain eye conditions. Malamutes can have hip or elbow dysplasia. Knowing the breed helps your vet provide targeted care. They can offer advice on nutrition and exercise. This advice will be specific to your puppy's needs. Do not hesitate to ask your vet for their opinion during a check-up.

#### Canine DNA Kits

For the most accurate breed identification, a canine DNA test is the best option. These kits are easy to use at home. You simply swab your puppy's cheek. Then you send the sample to a lab. The lab analyzes the DNA. They compare it to a vast database of breed markers. In a few weeks, you receive a detailed report.

This report will tell you the exact breed. If your puppy is a mix, it will show the percentage of each breed. DNA tests are highly reliable. They eliminate all guesswork. They provide peace of mind. They also give you precise information. This information helps you understand your puppy's genetic makeup. It helps you prepare for their adult size, temperament, and health predispositions. It is the most reliable way to tell if your puppy is a Husky or Malamute.
