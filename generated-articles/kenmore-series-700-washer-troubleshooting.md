## Kenmore Series 700 Washer Troubleshooting Guide

A Kenmore Series 700 washer is a household workhorse. It handles countless loads of laundry. When it stops working, it creates a big problem. You need your clothes clean. A malfunctioning washer can disrupt your whole routine. I understand the frustration when your appliance acts up. This guide helps you diagnose and fix common Kenmore Series 700 washer problems. We cover issues from power loss to leaks. You will learn simple steps to get your machine running again. My aim is to make these fixes easy for anyone to understand.

### Takeaway

*   Check power connections and circuit breakers first for no-power issues.
*   Ensure water supply hoses are open and clear if the washer is not filling.
*   Clear drain clogs and check the pump for draining problems.
*   Verify the lid switch and balance the load for spinning issues.
*   Address leaks by inspecting hoses, connections, and the tub seal.
*   Look up specific error codes to quickly diagnose machine faults.
*   Perform regular cleaning and maintenance to prevent future problems.

A Kenmore Series 700 washer that stops working often has a common, fixable issue. Most problems stem from power supply, water flow, or minor component failures like a faulty lid switch or clogged drain. You can often fix these problems yourself by carefully following troubleshooting steps.

### No Power or Washer Not Starting

Imagine walking into your laundry room. You press the power button on your Kenmore Series 700 washer. Nothing happens. The machine stays completely silent. This is a common and very frustrating problem. Several factors can cause your washer to lose power. We will explore these issues.

First, always check the power source. Is the power cord fully plugged into the wall outlet? Sometimes, a loose plug is the only problem. You should push it firmly into the socket. Also, check the circuit breaker. Your laundry room might have a dedicated circuit. A tripped breaker will cut power to the washer. Go to your home's electrical panel. Look for a breaker that is in the "off" position or in the middle. Flip it completely off, then back on. This resets the circuit. If the breaker trips again immediately, a more serious electrical issue exists. In this case, you should call a professional electrician.

Next, consider the outlet itself. The wall outlet might be faulty. You can test it by plugging in another small appliance, like a lamp. If the lamp works, the outlet is fine. If not, the outlet might need repair. You might also have an issue with the washer's internal power supply. This could be a blown fuse or a faulty power control board. These issues are more complex. They often require a technician. However, ruling out simpler causes first saves time and money.

The lid switch is another common culprit for a non-starting Kenmore Series 700 washer. The washer will not start if the lid switch is faulty. This switch ensures the washer only operates when the lid is closed for safety. Over time, the lid switch can wear out or become misaligned. You can test it by visually inspecting it. Look for any damage or broken parts near the lid hinge. Some models allow you to temporarily bypass the switch for testing, but I do not recommend this for regular use. A faulty lid switch often needs replacement. You can find replacement parts online or at appliance parts stores. Replacing this part is usually a simple process. It involves unscrewing the old switch and connecting the new one. Always unplug the washer before performing any repairs. Safety is very important.

Sometimes, the control panel itself might have an issue. If the display lights are on but the washer does not respond, try a hard reset. Unplug the washer from the wall. Wait for about five minutes. Then plug it back in. This can clear minor electronic glitches. If the control panel remains unresponsive, it might need replacement. This is a more advanced repair. You might want to seek help from a qualified technician. Always remember to consider power issues first when your Kenmore Series 700 washer shows no signs of life. Many times, the solution is simpler than you think. Proper power delivery is essential for any appliance.

### Washer Not Filling with Water

It is frustrating when your Kenmore Series 700 washer begins its cycle but no water enters the tub. This problem stops the wash cycle before it even starts. Several reasons can cause your washer not to fill. Checking these points systematically can help you find the solution.

First, check the water supply. Your washer has two water hoses. One connects to the hot water tap and the other to the cold water tap. Make sure both faucets are fully open. Sometimes, they might be accidentally turned off or not opened completely. This is an easy fix. Also, inspect the hoses themselves. Look for any kinks or bends. A kinked hose can restrict water flow. Straighten any hoses that are bent. The water hoses should run freely from the wall to the washer without obstruction.

Next, examine the screens at the water inlet valves. These are small mesh filters located where the hoses connect to the back of the washer. Over time, sediment or debris from your water supply can clog these screens. If they are blocked, water cannot pass through. To check them, turn off the water supply to the washer at the wall faucets. Disconnect the hot and cold water hoses from the back of the washer. You will see small screens inside the inlet ports. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers or tweezers to carefully pull out the screens. Rinse them under running water to remove any debris. You can use a small brush to scrub stubborn particles. Reinsert the screens and reattach the hoses firmly. Make sure you do not overtighten the connections, as this can damage them. This simple cleaning step often resolves filling issues.

The water inlet valve itself could be faulty. This valve is an electrical component. It opens to allow water into the tub when the washer calls for it. If the valve is defective, it might not open at all or only partially. You can usually hear a hum when the valve tries to open. If you hear no hum, the valve might not be receiving power. If you hear a hum but no water flows, the valve might be stuck or completely failed. Testing an inlet valve requires a multimeter and some electrical knowledge. If you are not comfortable with electrical testing, a technician can diagnose this. Replacing the water inlet valve is a common repair. It involves accessing the back of the washer and disconnecting wires and hoses. Remember to always disconnect power before working on electrical components.

Finally, the water level sensor might be malfunctioning. This sensor tells the washer how much water is in the tub. If it sends an incorrect signal, the washer might think it has enough water already and stop filling. This sensor is typically connected to an air tube that goes down to the bottom of the tub. If the tube is clogged or the sensor is faulty, it will not read correctly. Replacing a water level sensor usually requires accessing the control panel area of the washer. While less common than clogged screens or faulty valves, it is a possibility for Kenmore Series 700 washer not filling issues. Many Kenmore Series washers share similar mechanisms, so troubleshooting often follows a similar path as a [Kenmore Series 600 washer troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/kenmore-series-600-washer-troubleshooting) guide or even a [Kenmore Series 100 washer troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/kenmore-series-100-washer-troubleshooting) guide.

### Washer Not Draining

When your Kenmore Series 700 washer finishes a cycle but the tub remains full of soapy water, you have a draining problem. This is a common and messy issue. It prevents your clothes from getting properly cleaned. Understanding the reasons for poor drainage helps you fix it quickly.

The most frequent cause of a washer not draining is a clogged drain hose. The drain hose carries water from the washer to your standpipe or laundry sink. Over time, lint, small articles of clothing like socks, or other debris can get stuck in this hose. This blockage stops water from flowing out. First, inspect the drain hose for kinks. A simple bend can stop water flow. Straighten any kinks you find. Then, disconnect the drain hose from the standpipe or sink. Place the end of the hose into a bucket. If water gushes out, the clog is likely in your house's drain system, not the washer itself. If no water comes out or it drains very slowly, the clog is in the hose. You can try to clear it with a plumber's snake or by flushing it with water from a garden hose. Some people try pouring hot water down the hose, but be careful not to damage the hose.

Next, consider the drain pump. This is the component that actively pushes water out of the washer. If the pump is faulty or obstructed, it cannot remove the water. The pump often has a filter or trap that catches debris before it reaches the pump impeller. This filter can become clogged with lint, coins, buttons, or even small toys. You will usually find the drain pump filter located near the bottom front of the washer, behind a small access panel. Before opening it, place towels on the floor and have a shallow pan ready to catch any remaining water. Twist or pull the filter out. Clean any debris thoroughly. Check the impeller inside the pump housing for obstructions. Spin the impeller by hand to ensure it moves freely. If the pump motor hums but no water drains, the impeller might be broken or jammed. If there is no hum, the pump motor might be dead. A faulty drain pump needs replacement. This involves disassembling parts of the washer to access the pump. It usually connects with hoses and electrical wires.

The lid switch also plays a role in draining and spinning. If the lid switch is faulty, the washer might not progress to the drain or spin cycle. The control board thinks the lid is still open. Even if the tub filled and washed, it will not drain or spin. Check the lid switch for proper operation. Ensure it clicks when the lid closes. If it does not, or if it appears damaged, replacement might be necessary. Some Kenmore Series 700 models might display an error code related to drainage issues. Consulting your washer's user manual for specific error code meanings can provide clues. For example, if you are looking at [Kenmore Washer Model 110 Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/kenmore-washer-model-110-troubleshooting), you might find similar drainage system components. Addressing draining problems promptly prevents water damage and mold growth.

### Washer Not Spinning

A Kenmore Series 700 washer that completes its wash and drain cycles but leaves clothes soaking wet indicates a spinning problem. This is a common issue. Wet clothes require extra drying time, which wastes energy. Several components can cause a washer to stop spinning effectively.

One of the most frequent reasons for a washer not spinning is an unbalanced load. If heavy items, like towels or blankets, clump together on one side of the tub, the washer's sensor detects the imbalance. To prevent damage to the machine, it will stop the spin cycle. The washer might try to redistribute the load or just stop altogether. You can easily fix this. Open the washer lid and manually redistribute the clothes evenly around the agitator or drum. Close the lid and restart the spin cycle. Always try to balance loads before washing, especially with large or bulky items. Overloading the washer can also lead to imbalance issues. Only fill the tub to the recommended capacity for your specific Kenmore Series 700 model.

Similar to other washer issues, the lid switch is a critical component for the spin cycle. For safety, the washer will not spin if the lid is open or if the lid switch senses it is open. Even if the lid is physically closed, a faulty or misaligned lid switch will prevent the spin cycle from engaging. Check the lid switch. It should click when you close the lid. If it does not click or appears damaged, it likely needs replacement. Replacing a lid switch is usually straightforward. You can often find replacement parts easily online. Always unplug the washer before working on any internal components.

A worn-out drive belt can also cause a spinning issue. Many Kenmore Series 700 washers use a drive belt to transfer power from the motor to the transmission and then to the agitator and spin basket. Over time, this belt can stretch, crack, or break. If the belt is loose, it might slip, preventing the basket from reaching full spin speed. If it breaks completely, the basket will not spin at all. You need to access the back or bottom of the washer to inspect the drive belt. Look for visible signs of wear, fraying, or breakage. If the belt is damaged, it needs replacement. This repair can be more involved, often requiring tilting the washer or removing panels. Ensure you get the correct belt for your specific Kenmore Series 700 model.

Finally, a faulty motor coupling or a problem with the motor itself can cause spinning issues. The motor coupling connects the motor shaft to the transmission. It is designed to break if the motor or transmission is overloaded, protecting more expensive components. If it breaks, the motor will run, but the tub will not spin. Replacing the motor coupling usually involves tilting the washer back and accessing the motor and transmission. If the motor itself is faulty, it will not run or spin at all. This is a more serious issue and often requires professional diagnosis and repair. Many Kenmore washers, including front-load models like those covered in [Kenmore Elite Front Load Washer Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/kenmore-elite-front-load-washer-troubleshooting), share common spin system components, which can guide your repair efforts.

### Excessive Vibrations or Noise

When your Kenmore Series 700 washer starts shaking violently or making loud noises, it is a clear sign something is wrong. While some noise during the spin cycle is normal, excessive vibrations and loud sounds indicate a problem. Addressing these issues quickly prevents further damage to the machine or your laundry area.

One of the simplest reasons for excessive vibration is an unlevel washer. If the machine is not perfectly level, it can rock and shake during operation, especially during the spin cycle. To check this, place a spirit level on top of your washer. Adjust the leveling legs at the bottom of the machine until it is perfectly stable and level. Most washers have adjustable feet that you can twist to raise or lower each corner. Once adjusted, try to push on the corners of the washer. It should not rock or wobble. A stable base is crucial for smooth operation. Ensure the washer is on a solid floor. A weak or uneven floor can also contribute to vibration.

Worn-out shock absorbers or suspension springs are another common cause. These components cushion the movement of the washer tub during the spin cycle. Over time, they can lose their effectiveness or break. If they are faulty, the tub will move too freely, leading to violent shaking and banging noises. You can often inspect these by removing the front or back panel of the washer. Look for springs that are broken or detached. Examine the shock absorbers for leaks or visible damage. If any of these parts are worn or broken, they need replacement. This repair often involves tilting the washer and can be a bit challenging, but it is a common fix for a wobbly machine.

Foreign objects can also cause loud noises. Small items like coins, keys, or even loose buttons can fall out of pockets during a wash cycle. These items can get trapped between the inner and outer tubs. They then cause a rattling, scraping, or grinding noise during agitation or spin. If you suspect a foreign object, first check the coin trap or filter if your model has one. If not, you might need to remove the agitator (for top-load models) or the front baffle (for front-load models) to access the tub. Use a flashlight to look for any trapped items. Removing these objects can often resolve the noise immediately.

Finally, worn-out tub bearings can cause a grinding or roaring noise, particularly during the spin cycle. The tub bearings allow the inner tub to spin smoothly. If they fail, friction increases, leading to loud, metallic noises. This is a more complex and costly repair. It often involves disassembling a significant portion of the washer to replace the bearings. If you hear a loud grinding sound that gets worse during spin, it is likely a bearing issue. While you can attempt this repair yourself, it is often best left to a professional. Identifying the source of the noise is key to fixing your Kenmore Series 700 washer. Many issues can cause noise, but a methodical approach helps pinpoint the problem.

### Leaking Washer

A leaking Kenmore Series 700 washer is one of the most annoying problems. It can cause water damage to your floor, walls, and surrounding items. Finding the source of the leak is the first and most important step. Water leaks can originate from several points.

Start by checking the water supply hoses at the back of the washer. These hoses connect the washer to your hot and cold water faucets. Ensure they are tightly connected at both ends. Loose connections can drip. Also, inspect the hoses themselves for cracks, bulges, or corrosion. Over time, rubber hoses can deteriorate. If you see any signs of wear, replace them immediately. It is good practice to replace water supply hoses every five to seven years as a preventive measure. Use high-quality braided stainless steel hoses for better durability. These types of leaks are often easy to spot because the water appears near the back of the machine.

Next, examine the drain hose. The drain hose carries wastewater out of the washer. Make sure it is properly inserted into the standpipe or laundry sink. If it is not far enough down, water can splash out during drainage, especially during the fast spin cycle. Check for any cracks or holes in the drain hose itself. A damaged drain hose will leak. Secure the drain hose properly to prevent it from moving during operation. Ensure the drain hose is not pushed too far down the standpipe, as this can create a siphon effect and cause continuous draining, or it can create an airlock causing no drain. This also contributes to overflow.

The drain pump or its connections can also be a source of leaks. The drain pump is located at the bottom of the washer. If the pump housing is cracked or the hoses connected to it are loose or damaged, water will leak from this area. Accessing the drain pump usually requires removing a front or rear panel of the washer. Look for signs of water around the pump. Check all hose clamps connecting to the pump; tighten them if they are loose. If the pump itself is leaking, it will need replacement. This repair is common. Be sure to disconnect the power and have towels ready before working on the pump.

A leak from the tub seal or tub bearings is a more serious issue. The tub seal prevents water from escaping the main wash tub where the agitator or drum spins. If this seal wears out, water can leak down the agitator shaft or around the drum. This type of leak often appears underneath the washer, directly below the tub. Replacing a tub seal is a complex repair. It often involves disassembling the washer's transmission and removing the tub. This is usually a job for an experienced DIYer or a professional technician. Similarly, worn tub bearings can cause a leak around the shaft, as water escapes through the damaged bearing housing. If you notice water directly under the center of the washer, a tub seal or bearing issue is likely. Regular cleaning and maintenance, such as using the [clean washer cycle on your Kenmore top load](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-use-clean-washer-cycle-on-kenmore-top-load), can prevent some issues but not necessarily seal failures.

Finally, inspect the dispenser drawer if your Kenmore Series 700 is a front-load model or has a dispenser. Clogged dispenser channels can cause water to back up and overflow. Clean the dispenser drawer regularly. Remove it and rinse thoroughly under warm water. Use a small brush to clear any detergent or fabric softener residue. This can prevent leaks from the front of the washer. Any leak should be fixed promptly to prevent serious water damage to your home.

### Error Codes and Diagnostics

Modern Kenmore Series 700 washers come equipped with diagnostic capabilities. They display error codes when something goes wrong. These codes are invaluable. They help you pinpoint the exact problem without guessing. Understanding common error codes can save you time and money on service calls.

When your Kenmore Series 700 washer displays an alphanumeric code on its digital screen, it is communicating a specific fault. The first step is always to consult your washer's user manual. The manual contains a complete list of error codes specific to your model. It explains what each code means and often provides basic troubleshooting steps. If you do not have your manual, you can usually find it online on the Kenmore website or by searching for your specific model number. The model number is typically located inside the washer door, on the back, or sometimes on the control panel.

Common Kenmore error codes vary by model, but some general categories apply. For instance, codes starting with "F" often indicate a functional fault. "F01" might point to a main control board issue. "F02" could signal a problem with the motor control. "F05" might indicate an issue with the water temperature sensor. It is crucial to remember that exact meanings differ. Always refer to your specific manual. Other common codes relate to water issues. If your washer is not filling, you might see codes like "E1" or "LF" (low fill). These codes suggest issues with water supply, inlet valves, or the water level sensor. If the washer is not draining, codes like "ND" (no drain) or "E4" might appear. These point to drain pump clogs or failures.

The lid switch, a frequent trouble spot, also has its own error codes. You might see "Ld" or "UL" for an unlocked lid or "dL" for a door lock issue. These codes mean the washer cannot proceed with the cycle until the lid/door is properly closed and locked. Always ensure the lid is fully shut. Check for any obstructions. Test the lid switch for proper operation. If the switch is faulty, replacing it often clears these codes.

Sometimes, simply resetting the washer can clear a temporary error code. Unplug the washer from the wall outlet. Wait for about 5 minutes. Then plug it back in. This hard reset can resolve minor electronic glitches. If the code reappears immediately, the problem is persistent. It requires further investigation. For recurring error codes, you might need to test specific components. This can involve using a multimeter to check continuity or voltage. If you are not comfortable with electrical testing, it is wise to call a professional. Diagnosing and addressing error codes correctly helps restore your Kenmore Series 700 washer's function efficiently. Other Kenmore models, such as those discussed in [Kenmore Series 500 Washer Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/kenmore-series-500-washer-troubleshooting), also use diagnostic codes. The principles of looking up and understanding these codes are often universal across the brand.

### Preventative Maintenance Tips

Keeping your Kenmore Series 700 washer in good condition requires some simple preventative maintenance. Regular care can prevent many common problems. It also extends the lifespan of your appliance. I always tell people that a little effort now saves a lot of headaches later.

First, always check pockets before washing clothes. Small items like coins, keys, or tissues can cause serious damage. They can clog pumps, damage agitators, or get stuck between tubs. This simple step prevents foreign object obstructions. It also protects your personal belongings. I try to make this a habit for everyone in my household.

Next, regularly clean your washer. Over time, detergent residue, fabric softener, and mineral deposits can build up inside the tub and dispenser. This can lead to odors, mildew, and even affect drainage. You should run a "clean washer" cycle at least once a month. Many Kenmore Series 700 models have a dedicated clean cycle. If yours does not, run a hot water cycle with two cups of white vinegar or a specialized washing machine cleaner. This helps remove buildup. For top-load models, pay attention to the agitator and tub walls. For front-load models, always wipe down the door gasket after each use to prevent mold. Leave the door slightly ajar after a cycle. This allows air to circulate and the drum to dry. Proper cleaning is key to fresh laundry and a healthy machine. You can find more specific advice on maintaining your appliance in articles like [How to Clean Kenmore Elite Washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-kenmore-elite-washer).

Inspect your hoses periodically. Check the water inlet hoses for any signs of wear, cracks, or bulges. Hoses can burst, causing significant water damage. Replace rubber hoses every 5-7 years, or sooner if they show signs of deterioration. Braided stainless steel hoses offer better longevity. Also, ensure the drain hose is clear and properly secured. A loose or clogged drain hose can lead to leaks or poor drainage. Make sure there are no kinks in any hoses.

Do not overload your washer. Overloading puts excessive strain on the motor, transmission, and suspension system. It can lead to an unbalanced load, which causes violent shaking during the spin cycle. This stress accelerates wear and tear on components like shock absorbers and bearings. Follow your washer's capacity recommendations. Distribute clothes evenly in the tub. If you have very large items, like comforters, consider taking them to a laundromat with industrial-sized machines.

Finally, keep the washer level. Recheck the leveling feet periodically. If your washer becomes unlevel, it can vibrate excessively, leading to noise and component wear. A stable machine operates more efficiently and quietly. These preventative steps are not time-consuming. They significantly extend the life and efficiency of your Kenmore Series 700 washer. Regular maintenance is a small investment that yields big returns in appliance longevity and reliable performance.

### When to Call a Professional

While many Kenmore Series 700 washer problems are fixable with DIY methods, some issues require professional attention. Knowing when to call a technician can save you time, prevent further damage, and ensure your safety. I always recommend caution when dealing with complex appliance repairs.

One clear sign to call a professional is when you encounter electrical issues beyond a tripped breaker or a loose plug. If you suspect a problem with the main control board, motor, or wiring, it is best to leave it to experts. Working with electricity can be dangerous. Incorrect repairs can cause more damage to the appliance or even lead to fires. If you lack experience with electrical testing or repairs, do not attempt to fix these components yourself. Professionals have the right tools and knowledge.

Another reason to call for help is if the repair requires specialized tools or extensive disassembly. Replacing major components like the transmission, tub bearings, or the entire motor can be very complex. These jobs often involve removing many parts, using specific tools, and knowing the exact reassembly order. If you feel overwhelmed by the repair process, or if you do not have the proper tools, a professional can complete the job efficiently and correctly.
