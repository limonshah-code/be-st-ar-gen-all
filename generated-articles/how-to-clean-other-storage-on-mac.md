## Clear 'Other' Storage on Mac: A Comprehensive Guide

Has your Mac's storage felt full lately? Many Mac users find their disk space mysteriously shrinking. When you check your storage breakdown, you might see a large chunk labeled "Other." This category often puzzles people, and it can grow quite large. Knowing how to clean "Other" storage on Mac is vital for maintaining performance and having enough room for new files.

I understand this frustration. I have experienced it myself. This guide will help you understand what "Other" storage includes. We will explore practical steps to identify and remove unnecessary files. You will learn how to free up valuable space on your Mac. Get ready to reclaim your disk space and boost your Mac's efficiency.

### Takeaway

Cleaning "Other" storage on your Mac requires understanding its components and systematically removing unneeded files. Key steps include:

*   **Identifying:** Use macOS storage management tools to see what is filling "Other" space.
*   **Deleting Caches & Logs:** Remove temporary system, application, and browser files.
*   **Managing Downloads & Documents:** Clear old, large, or redundant user files.
*   **Removing Old Backups:** Erase outdated iOS backups and disk images.
*   **Uninstalling Apps:** Properly remove unused applications and their leftover data.
*   **Utilizing macOS Tools:** Use built-in features like "Optimize Storage" and "Reduce Clutter."

### What is "Other" Storage on Mac?

"Other" storage on Mac refers to files that do not fit into standard categories like Apps, Documents, Photos, or Music. This category includes system files, caches, logs, old backups, disk images, plug-ins, extensions, and various temporary files. It accumulates data from many sources, making it a common reason for low disk space.

### Understanding 'Other' Storage on Mac

We all love our Macs for their sleek design and powerful performance. However, even the best machines can get bogged down by accumulated data. A common culprit is the elusive "Other" storage category. It often grows silently, consuming precious gigabytes on your disk. Many users feel confused by this label. I certainly did when I first saw it.

This "Other" category is not a single type of file. Instead, it is a collection of various file types that macOS classifies outside the main categories. Think of it as a digital junk drawer. It holds items you might need sometimes, but it also collects a lot of clutter over time. This includes a wide range of data. Understanding what constitutes "Other" storage helps you decide what to remove.

For example, this category contains system files and temporary data. It includes application caches. These caches help apps run faster by storing frequently used data. However, over time, these caches can grow very large. They then take up a lot of space unnecessarily. Log files are another example. These files record system and application activities. They are useful for troubleshooting, but they also accumulate data.

Beyond caches and logs, "Other" storage also includes various support files. These are files applications create during their use. It can also hold old disk images (DMG files) that you downloaded and forgot about. Even old iOS device backups can contribute to this category if they are stored locally on your Mac. These items are not always immediately obvious. This makes the "Other" category a mystery to many users.

*   **Cache Files:** These are temporary data files. Applications, browsers, and the system create them. They speed up processes. Over time, these files can become massive and redundant.
*   **Log Files:** macOS and applications generate log files. They record system events and errors. These files help developers debug issues but are not necessary for daily operation.
*   **Temporary Files:** Various processes create temporary files. macOS usually deletes them. Sometimes, they remain on your disk, taking up space.
*   **Application Data:** This includes plug-ins, extensions, settings, and other support files that applications create. Even after you uninstall an app, some of these files might remain.
*   **Disk Images and Archives:** Downloaded `.dmg` files (disk images) and `.zip`, `.tar`, or `.rar` archive files often fall into "Other." You might install software from a DMG and then forget to delete the image.
*   **iOS Backups:** If you back up your iPhone or iPad to your Mac, these backups are stored in "Other" storage. Old backups can consume many gigabytes.
*   **User Data:** This can include documents, downloads, and media files that macOS doesn't categorize neatly. Examples are unusual file types or files stored in non-standard locations.

Understanding these components helps you approach the cleaning process more systematically. You can target specific types of files known to contribute heavily to "Other" storage. This makes the cleanup process much more effective.

### Finding the Culprits: Identifying Large Files and Data

Before you start deleting, you need to know what is actually filling your "Other" storage. macOS provides built-in tools to help you identify large files and data categories. These tools are your first stop in understanding your disk usage. I always start here to get a visual overview. It is like looking at a map before embarking on a journey.

Accessing these tools is simple. Go to the Apple menu in the top-left corner of your screen. Select "About This Mac." Then, click on "Storage." This window gives you a colorful breakdown of your storage. You will see categories like Apps, Documents, Photos, and, prominently, "Other." This visual representation helps you see just how much space "Other" is occupying.

To dig deeper, click the "Manage" button in the Storage window. This opens the Storage Management window. Here, Apple offers several recommendations. You might see options like "Store in iCloud," "Optimize Storage," and "Reduce Clutter." While these are helpful, the sidebar on the left is where you can explore specific categories. It lists items like Applications, Documents, Mail, and sometimes even a general "Other" category.

#### How to View Storage Categories

The Storage Management window provides a more detailed view than the initial "About This Mac" window. It allows you to sort files by size and type within certain categories. For instance, clicking on "Documents" in the sidebar shows you a list of all your documents. You can sort them by size. This helps you quickly spot large files you might no longer need. While "Other" itself is not a clickable category here for a detailed list, files that contribute to it are often found within "Documents" (like large archives) or are located via manual search in Finder.

The "Recommendations" section is useful. It suggests ways to free up space. "Reduce Clutter" is particularly helpful. Click "Review Files" under "Reduce Clutter." This opens a window with various file categories. You can see large files, downloads, and unsupported apps. This is a great place to start your search for large, unnecessary items. I often find forgotten movie files or old software installers here.

#### Using Finder to Pinpoint Big Files

The Storage Management window is a good starting point. However, Finder is your powerful tool for a truly granular search. You can configure Finder to locate large files anywhere on your Mac. This method gives you complete control over your search parameters. I use this trick often to find hidden giants.

Open a Finder window. Go to "File" in the menu bar and select "New Smart Folder." Alternatively, press Command + Option + N. A new Finder window opens with search parameters. Click the "+" button in the top-right corner to add new criteria. Set the first criterion to "Kind" is "Any." Then, add another criterion. Set it to "File Size" is "greater than" a specific amount, for example, 500 MB or 1 GB.

This search immediately displays all files larger than your specified size. You can then sort these results by size. This helps you identify the biggest space hogs on your Mac. These files might be old video projects, large application installers, or extensive data archives. Review these files carefully. You can move them to an external drive, upload them to cloud storage, or delete them if they are no longer needed. Always be cautious when deleting files, especially if you are unsure of their purpose. A good rule is: if you did not create it and do not know what it is, research it first before deleting.

### Clearing System Caches and Log Files

Cache and log files are significant contributors to the "Other" storage category. They accumulate over time, often unnoticed. While they serve a purpose, old or excessive caches and logs can unnecessarily consume disk space. I make it a habit to periodically clear these files. It helps keep my Mac running smoothly.

Caches are temporary files created by macOS, applications, and web browsers. They store data that might be needed again quickly. For example, your web browser caches images and scripts from websites you visit frequently. This makes pages load faster on subsequent visits. Applications also create caches to store user data or configurations. While helpful initially, these caches can become outdated. They can also grow excessively large.

Log files record system and application activities. They are essential for troubleshooting issues. When an app crashes or macOS encounters an error, log files provide information to developers. However, these files are not typically needed for day-to-day operation by the average user. They can also take up a surprising amount of space over months or years. Deleting them is generally safe.

#### Browser Caches and History

Your web browser is a major generator of cache files. Every website you visit stores data on your Mac. This includes images, scripts, and cookies. Over time, these files add up. Cleaning your browser's cache and history regularly is a simple but effective way to free up space. Each browser has its own steps for this. For example, in Safari, go to Safari > Clear History. In Chrome, go to History > Show Full History > Clear browsing data. This action removes accumulated data.

It is also important to consider caches from other applications. Email clients, like Outlook, create large caches. They store email content and attachments for quick access. Clearing these caches can free up substantial space. If you use Microsoft Outlook on your Mac, you can learn [how to clear Outlook cache on Mac](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clear-outlook-cache-on-mac). This specific action helps reclaim space taken by your email client. Similarly, communication apps like FaceTime also store data. To manage these, consider exploring guides on [how to clear FaceTime history on Mac](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clear-facetime-history-on-mac). This prevents unnecessary data buildup.

#### User and Application Logs

Locating and deleting log files requires a bit more care. You can find them in specific folders on your Mac. Most user-specific log files are in your Library folder. This folder is hidden by default. To access it, open Finder, click "Go" in the menu bar, and hold down the Option key. "Library" will appear in the dropdown menu. Click it.

Inside the Library folder, navigate to the "Logs" folder. Here, you will find various log files from your user account. Review these files. You can usually delete old log files without issues. I typically sort them by date and remove anything older than a few months. Be careful not to delete entire folders unless you are certain.

Application-specific log files are often located within the `~/Library/Application Support/[App Name]/` or `~/Library/Caches/` folders. Sometimes, you might find application logs in `/Library/Logs` or `/Library/Application Support/` (the root Library, not your user-specific one). Deleting these files manually is generally safe. Just be cautious not to delete anything vital. If you are unsure, do not delete it.

For system caches, they are located in `~/Library/Caches/` and `/Library/Caches/`. Again, you can safely delete the contents of these folders. Do not delete the folders themselves. Just select all files and subfolders within them and move them to the Trash. Empty the Trash afterward. Restarting your Mac after clearing caches and logs is a good idea. This allows the system to rebuild necessary files fresh.

### Managing Documents, Downloads, and Obsolete Media

User-generated content, downloads, and old media files contribute significantly to the "Other" storage category. These files are often forgotten. They sit on your Mac, consuming valuable space. Taking time to review and organize these items can yield substantial results. I find this process therapeutic, like decluttering a physical space.

Your Documents folder often holds a mix of important work files and forgotten personal items. It is easy for this folder to become a digital graveyard of old projects, redundant versions, or files you no longer need. I make it a point to regularly go through my Documents folder. I look for large files or folders that I have not opened in a long time.

Similarly, your Photos and Music libraries can grow immense. While macOS categorizes these specifically, temporary or unprocessed media files might slip into "Other." For instance, raw video files from an unfinished project or temporary audio recordings can add up. Reviewing these helps manage space. If you have completed a video project, consider archiving the raw files to an external drive. You do not need them on your primary hard drive.

#### Taming the Downloads Folder

The Downloads folder is a notorious space hog for many users. Every file you download from the internet usually ends up here. This includes software installers, PDF documents, temporary images, and various archives. Most people download something, use it once, and then forget about it. Over months, this folder can accumulate hundreds, if not thousands, of items.

I advise regularly clearing out your Downloads folder. Set aside a few minutes each week or month to review its contents. Sort the folder by "Date Added" to quickly see the newest items. Then, sort by "Size" to identify the largest files. Delete software installers (.dmg, .pkg, .exe files) after you have installed the application. Remove old PDFs, temporary images, or any other files you no longer need. For important documents, move them to a more appropriate location, such as your Documents folder or a cloud storage service.

Consider creating subfolders within Downloads for temporary organization. This helps if you need to keep a downloaded file for a short period. For instance, a "To Process" folder for files that need your attention soon. Once processed, move or delete them. This systematic approach prevents your Downloads folder from becoming an overflowing digital bin.

#### Reviewing Large Documents and Media

Beyond the Downloads folder, large documents and media files can hide anywhere on your Mac. These might be old presentations with high-resolution images, large spreadsheets, or even vast text files. Video files, especially, consume significant amounts of storage. A single uncompressed video can easily take up tens of gigabytes.

Use Finder's Smart Folder feature, as discussed earlier, to find files larger than a certain size. Search your entire Mac for files over, say, 1 GB. This will highlight all the big files on your drive, regardless of their location. Once identified, evaluate each file. Do you still need it? Is it a duplicate? Can it be compressed?

For large media files, consider these options:
*   **External Storage:** Move old movies, raw video footage, or large photo libraries to an external hard drive. This frees up immediate space on your Mac.
*   **Cloud Storage:** Services like iCloud Drive, Google Drive, or Dropbox offer solutions for offloading large files. Be mindful of storage limits and subscription costs.
*   **Compression:** For large documents or archives of files, consider compressing them into a `.zip` file. This reduces their size. macOS has a built-in compression utility. Right-click a file or folder and select "Compress."
*   **Delete Duplicates:** You might have multiple copies of the same file. Use duplicate file finders or manually search for them. Removing duplicates can free up unexpected space.

Remember to empty your Trash after deleting these files. Files only truly disappear from your disk when the Trash is emptied. This step is crucial for reclaiming the space.

### Deleting Old iOS Backups and Disk Images

Many Mac users are unaware that old iOS device backups and downloaded disk images contribute significantly to "Other" storage. These files often sit untouched for years, taking up valuable gigabytes. I always check these areas when my Mac is running low on space. They are often easy wins for freeing up space.

When you back up your iPhone or iPad to your Mac using Finder (or iTunes on older macOS versions), these backups are stored locally. Each backup can be several gigabytes in size. If you have multiple devices or have backed up the same device many times over the years, these can quickly accumulate. Sometimes, you might perform a backup, then get a new device, and forget about the old backup files. They just sit there, adding to your "Other" storage.

Disk image files, typically with a `.dmg` extension, are another common space hog. Developers often distribute software for macOS in this format. When you download an app, you get a DMG file. You open it, drag the app to your Applications folder, and then ideally, you eject the disk image and delete the DMG file. However, many people forget this last step. These DMG files then linger in your Downloads folder or other arbitrary locations. They take up space long after their purpose is served.

#### Removing iOS Backups

Removing old iOS backups is a straightforward process through Finder.
1.  Open Finder.
2.  In the menu bar, go to Finder > Settings (or Preferences).
3.  Click the "Devices" tab.
4.  You will see a list of your iOS backups.
5.  Select the backups you no longer need. These are usually old backups of devices you no longer own, or outdated backups of your current device. Be careful not to delete your most recent backup if you still need it!
6.  Click "Delete Backup." Confirm your choice.

Alternatively, you can access them directly:
1.  Open Finder.
2.  In the menu bar, choose Go > Go to Folder...
3.  Type `~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/` and press Enter.
4.  This folder contains all your iOS device backups. Each backup is a folder with a long alphanumeric name.
5.  You can identify backups by their creation date. Delete the folders of backups you no longer need by dragging them to the Trash.
6.  Empty the Trash afterward.

I recommend keeping at least one recent backup of your current device. Only delete old or redundant ones.

#### Deleting Disk Images (.dmg files)

Deleting old disk images is even simpler.
1.  Open Finder.
2.  Use the search bar in the top right corner.
3.  Type `.dmg` and press Enter.
4.  You will see a list of all disk image files on your Mac.
5.  Review the list. Identify files for applications you have already installed.
6.  Drag these `.dmg` files to the Trash.
7.  Empty the Trash.

You can also use the Smart Folder trick mentioned earlier. Create a Smart Folder with the criterion "Kind" is "Disk Image." This will show you all DMG files on your Mac. Sort by size to quickly spot the largest ones. I often find huge installer files for macOS upgrades or large applications that I downloaded years ago. These are typically safe to delete once the software is installed and running correctly. This is one of the quickest ways to clean "Other" storage on Mac.

### Removing Unused Applications and Their Leftovers

Many users uninstall applications by simply dragging them from the Applications folder to the Trash. While this removes the main application file, it often leaves behind support files, preferences, and caches. These leftovers can accumulate over time. They contribute to your "Other" storage. Proper uninstallation ensures you truly remove an app and all its associated data.

I used to just drag apps to the Trash. Then I learned how much junk was left behind. These remnants can be small individually. But they add up. They also sometimes cause conflicts or performance issues. Thorough removal is key to keeping your Mac clean.

#### Uninstalling Applications Effectively

For complete removal, I recommend using a dedicated uninstaller tool or manually searching for associated files.
*   **App-Specific Uninstallers:** Some applications, especially larger ones, come with their own uninstaller. Check the app's folder in Applications or its developer's website for an uninstaller.
*   **Third-Party Uninstaller Apps:** Several reliable third-party tools specialize in completely removing applications and their related files. These tools scan your system for all components of a selected app. They then offer to delete them. Examples include CleanMyMac X or AppCleaner. While using third-party tools, ensure they are reputable.
*   **Manual Uninstallation (More Involved):** If you prefer not to use third-party tools, you can manually search for leftover files. This method requires more care.

#### Searching for Application Support Files

Application support files, preferences, and caches are typically found in your Mac's Library folder. Remember, this folder is hidden by default.

To access your Library folder:
1.  Open Finder.
2.  Click "Go" in the menu bar.
3.  Hold down the Option key. "Library" will appear in the dropdown. Click it.

Once in the Library folder, you will want to check these subfolders for files related to the uninstalled application:

*   `~/Library/Application Support/`: This folder contains support files, databases, and other data specific to applications. Look for folders named after the uninstalled app or its developer.
*   `~/Library/Caches/`: This folder stores temporary cache files created by apps. Look for folders or files named after the uninstalled app.
*   `~/Library/Preferences/`: This folder holds preference files (plist files) for applications. Find and delete `.plist` files associated with the uninstalled app. They are usually named in a reverse domain name format, like `com.developer.appname.plist`.
*   `~/Library/Containers/` and `~/Library/Group Containers/`: These folders store data for sandboxed applications (apps downloaded from the Mac App Store). Look for folders related to the uninstalled app.
*   `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`: This folder might contain agents that launch parts of an application at startup. If you find a `.plist` file here related to the uninstalled app, delete it.

**Important Warning:** Be extremely careful when deleting files from the Library folder. Do not delete entire folders unless you are absolutely sure they belong to an uninstalled app. Deleting the wrong file can cause system instability or issues with other applications. If in doubt, move the file to your desktop temporarily. If your Mac runs fine for a few days, then trash it. This method helps clean "Other" storage on Mac safely and effectively.

Sometimes, unwanted software can be harder to remove or can reappear. This might indicate a deeper issue, like malware. While cleaning "Other" storage does not directly address viruses, removing persistent unwanted files is a good step towards overall system health. If you suspect your Mac has malicious software, you might need to learn [how to clean Mac from viruses](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mac-from-viruses) for a comprehensive solution. This ensures all unwanted files are gone, not just typical "Other" storage items.

### Optimizing Storage with macOS Tools

Apple understands that managing storage can be a hassle. That is why macOS includes several built-in tools designed to help you optimize your disk space. These features are easy to use and can significantly reduce clutter, including elements that contribute to "Other" storage. I find these tools incredibly helpful for quick wins.

These tools are not just for cleaning. They help you maintain your storage efficiently over time. They are integrated directly into the operating system. This makes them a reliable choice for most users. You can access these features from the "Storage Management" window, which we visited earlier. Remember, you can get there by going to Apple menu > About This Mac > Storage > Manage.

Once in the Storage Management window, you will see a list of recommendations at the top. These recommendations are designed to help you free up space quickly and easily. They often target large files or categories that are known to accumulate data. Let's look at the most useful ones.

*   **Store in iCloud:** This option moves your desktop and Documents folder files to iCloud Drive. Files remain accessible on demand. Local copies are replaced with small placeholder files. This frees up significant local disk space. If you have a large amount of data in these locations, this can instantly clear gigabytes. I use this for files I do not access daily.
*   **Optimize Storage:** This feature targets media files. It automatically removes watched Apple TV movies and TV shows from your Mac. It also keeps only recent email attachments when storage space is needed. This is great for those who consume a lot of media. The original files remain in iCloud or on the server. You can download them again if needed.
*   **Empty Trash Automatically:** This setting configures your Mac to automatically delete items that have been in the Trash for 30 days. This prevents forgotten files from lingering in the Trash and consuming space. It is a set-it-and-forget-it solution that helps maintain a clean system. I always enable this.

#### Reduce Clutter: A Deeper Dive

The "Reduce Clutter" option is perhaps the most powerful tool within macOS Storage Management for tackling "
