## Learn How To Clean Knit Shoes Easily

Knit shoes offer comfort and style. Their breathable design makes them popular for everyday wear. However, their fabric construction also makes them prone to dirt and stains. Knowing how to clean knit shoes correctly helps keep them looking great. This guide shares proven methods for cleaning your knit footwear. We will cover preparation, different cleaning methods, and proper drying techniques. You will also learn about specific stain removal tips and how to protect your shoes.

### Takeaway

*   Always remove laces and insoles before cleaning knit shoes.
*   Pre-clean with a dry brush to remove loose dirt.
*   Hand washing is the safest method for delicate knit materials.
*   Use a mesh laundry bag and cold water if machine washing.
*   Air dry knit shoes away from direct heat or sunlight.

### Main Query Answer

To clean knit shoes, remove loose dirt with a dry brush. Then, gently hand wash them using mild soap and water, focusing on dirty areas. Rinse thoroughly and allow them to air dry away from heat. For tougher stains, spot clean with a gentle solution.

## Understanding Knit Shoe Materials and Their Care Needs

Knit shoes often feature synthetic fibers like polyester or nylon. These materials offer flexibility and breathability. They also stretch and conform to your foot. This unique structure requires a gentle approach to cleaning. Harsh chemicals or aggressive scrubbing can damage the fabric. It can cause stretching, pilling, or discoloration. We want to preserve the shoe's shape and integrity.

Some knit shoes use a blend of materials. They might have a rubber sole, foam midsole, or synthetic overlays. Each part needs specific care. The knit upper is the most delicate part. It can absorb dirt and odors easily. Proper cleaning helps remove these issues. It also prevents dirt from embedding deeper into the fibers. You can keep your shoes feeling fresh and looking new for longer.

My own knit sneakers, for example, gather dust quickly when I walk on trails. I have learned that a gentle wipe-down after each use helps a lot. It stops the dirt from building up. Regular care is key to maintaining the shoe's appearance. It also extends its lifespan. You protect your investment when you care for your shoes.

Different types of knit shoes exist. Some are thin and open-weave, others are thicker. Always check the shoe's care tag if it has one. This tag provides manufacturer recommendations. If no tag is present, always choose the gentlest cleaning method first. This approach minimizes any risk of damage.

## Essential Supplies for Cleaning Knit Shoes

Before you start cleaning your knit shoes, gather all necessary supplies. Having everything ready makes the process smoother. You will need a few basic items. Most of these are likely already in your home. This list ensures you have the right tools for effective cleaning.

Here is what you will need:

*   **Soft-bristled brush:** An old toothbrush or a shoe brush works well. This helps remove loose dirt without harming the fabric.
*   **Mild soap or detergent:** Use a gentle laundry detergent, dish soap, or a dedicated shoe cleaner. Avoid harsh chemicals or bleach. These can damage the knit material.
*   **Two clean cloths or sponges:** One for applying the cleaning solution and one for rinsing. Microfiber cloths are excellent choices.
*   **Two small bowls:** One for your cleaning solution and one for clean water.
*   **Warm water:** Not hot water, as hot water can cause shrinking or damage.
*   **Old towels:** These protect your work surface and absorb excess water from the shoes.
*   **Shoe trees or paper towels:** These help maintain the shoe's shape during drying. Do not use newspaper, as ink can transfer.
*   **Mesh laundry bag (optional):** Essential if you plan to machine wash your shoes.
*   **Stain remover (optional):** For specific, stubborn stains like grease or grass.

I always prepare my cleaning station before starting. This setup prevents interruptions during the cleaning process. It also ensures I have everything at hand when I need it. This simple preparation step saves time and makes cleaning easier. Proper tools lead to better cleaning results for your knit shoes.

## Pre-Cleaning Steps: Preparing Your Knit Shoes

Proper preparation is crucial before you start scrubbing. This stage removes loose dirt and protects delicate parts. Skipping these steps can make cleaning harder. It might also push dirt deeper into the fabric. Taking a few moments now saves a lot of effort later.

Follow these important pre-cleaning steps:

1.  **Remove Laces and Insoles:** Take out the shoelaces first. Remove the insoles if they are removable. This allows you to clean these parts separately. It also lets you access the shoe's interior for thorough cleaning. You can clean laces by hand or put them in the mesh bag for machine washing. You can learn more about [how to clean the inside of shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes) in another guide.
2.  **Shake Off Loose Dirt:** Hold each shoe upside down and shake it gently. This helps dislodge any debris or pebbles stuck in the sole. You might be surprised by how much dirt comes out.
3.  **Dry Brush the Exterior:** Use a soft-bristled brush or an old toothbrush. Gently brush off any dried mud or surface dirt from the knit upper and sole. Work in small sections. Do not scrub hard, especially on the knit fabric. This step prevents the dirt from turning into muddy streaks when you add water. If your shoes are very dirty, like covered in mud, you might want to learn [how to clean mud off white shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mud-off-white-shoes) for specific tips on pre-treating.
4.  **Wipe Down Soles:** Use a damp cloth to wipe down the rubber outsoles and midsoles. Remove any visible grime or scuff marks. For stubborn scuffs, check out our guide on [how to clean scuff marks off shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-scuff-marks-off-shoes). This ensures dirt from the sole does not transfer to the clean knit fabric during washing.

I always find that these initial steps make a big difference. They make the actual washing process more effective. My knit shoes always look better after proper preparation.

## Hand Washing Knit Shoes: The Safest Method

Hand washing is generally the safest and most recommended method for cleaning knit shoes. It gives you direct control over the cleaning process. This reduces the risk of damage to delicate knit fibers. This method is best for most knit shoes, especially those with intricate designs or very light colors.

Here is a step-by-step guide to hand washing your knit shoes:

1.  **Prepare Cleaning Solution:** Fill one small bowl with warm water. Add a few drops of mild soap or detergent to this bowl. Stir gently until the soap dissolves and creates a light lather. You want a gentle solution, not a lot of suds.
2.  **Dampen and Apply:** Dip a clean cloth or soft brush into the soapy water. Wring out excess liquid. You want the cloth to be damp, not dripping wet. Gently dab and wipe the knit upper of your shoe. Work in small sections. Avoid saturating the fabric.
3.  **Gentle Scrubbing:** For tougher spots or dirt, use the soft-bristled brush. Gently scrub in circular motions. Focus on soiled areas. Be careful not to apply too much pressure. Aggressive scrubbing can damage the knit. For example, if you have grass stains, a specific approach might be needed. Our article on [how to clean grass stains off shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-grass-stains-off-shoes) offers more detailed advice.
4.  **Clean the Soles:** Use the same soapy cloth or brush to clean the rubber outsoles and midsoles. You can be a bit firmer here, as rubber is more durable than knit fabric.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Fill the second bowl with clean, warm water. Dip a clean, separate cloth into the clean water. Wring it out. Use this cloth to wipe away all soap residue from the knit shoe. Rinse the cloth often in the clean water. Repeat until no soap remains. Soap left behind can attract more dirt or cause discoloration.
6.  **Pat Dry:** Use a clean, dry towel to gently pat down the entire shoe. This removes as much surface moisture as possible. Do not twist or wring the shoe. This can distort its shape.

I always hand wash my more expensive knit sneakers. I find the process relaxing. It also ensures my shoes stay in top condition. This method provides the best care for delicate fabrics.

## Machine Washing Knit Shoes: When and How

While hand washing is ideal, some knit shoes can be machine washed. This method offers convenience, especially for very dirty shoes or if you are short on time. However, machine washing carries more risks. It can cause shrinking, stretching, or damage if not done correctly. Only machine wash if the manufacturer's instructions allow it or if you are willing to accept the risk.

Before machine washing, consider these points:

*   **Check Shoe Material:** Is it durable synthetic knit? Avoid machine washing delicate blends, wool knits, or shoes with many embellishments.
*   **Read Care Labels:** Always check for any care instructions on your shoe's tag.

Here is how to machine wash knit shoes safely:

1.  **Pre-Treat Stains:** Address any visible stains before putting shoes in the washer. Use a mild stain remover directly on the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes.
2.  **Remove Laces and Insoles:** As with hand washing, remove these parts. Clean them separately or put them in the same laundry bag.
3.  **Place in a Mesh Laundry Bag:** This is a crucial step. Put both shoes into a large mesh laundry bag. The bag protects the shoes from direct impact against the washing machine drum. It also keeps them from tangling with other items. This also applies to other types of shoes. For instance, knowing [how to clean shoes in the washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer) generally involves this protective step.
4.  **Add Towels:** Place a few old towels into the washing machine along with the shoe bag. The towels act as a buffer. They cushion the shoes during agitation. This prevents loud banging noises and reduces stress on the shoes.
5.  **Use Cold Water and Gentle Cycle:** Set your washing machine to a gentle cycle. Use cold water only. Hot water can cause knit materials to shrink or colors to bleed. Choose a mild detergent. Use a small amount. Avoid bleach or harsh chemicals.
6.  **Start the Wash:** Run the cycle. Once finished, remove the shoes promptly. Do not leave them sitting in the machine.

I have successfully machine-washed my athletic knit shoes many times. The mesh bag and towels make a big difference. My shoes come out clean and undamaged every time. Always prioritize safety for your footwear.

## Tackling Common Stains on Knit Shoes

Knit shoes are prone to various stains due to their absorbent nature. Mud, grease, and general grime are common culprits. Addressing stains quickly improves your chances of complete removal. Different types of stains require specific approaches.

Here is how to handle common stains:

### Mud Stains

*   **Dry First:** Let mud dry completely before attempting to clean it. Wet mud spreads easily and can push dirt deeper into the knit fibers.
*   **Scrape and Brush:** Once dry, gently scrape off large chunks of mud with a dull knife or spoon. Use a soft-bristled brush to brush away remaining dried mud. Work outdoors if possible.
*   **Hand Wash:** Follow the hand washing steps mentioned earlier. Use a mild soap solution and a soft cloth or brush to clean the stained area. Rinse well. If the mud is particularly stubborn, our guide on [how to clean mud off white shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mud-off-white-shoes) offers more in-depth strategies that can apply to knit.

### Grease or Oil Stains

*   **Absorb Excess:** As soon as possible, blot the stain with a paper towel. Do not rub, as this can spread the grease. Sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder generously over the stain. Let it sit for several hours, or even overnight. This helps absorb the oil.
*   **Brush Off Powder:** Gently brush off the powder.
*   **Spot Clean:** Apply a small amount of mild dish soap directly onto the stain. Dish soap is good at cutting grease. Gently rub with your finger or a soft cloth.
*   **Rinse and Dry:** Rinse the area with a damp cloth, wiping away all soap. Pat dry. Repeat if necessary.

### General Dirt and Grime

*   **Pre-Brush:** Remove as much loose dirt as possible with a dry brush.
*   **Spot Clean or Hand Wash:** For small areas, spot clean with a damp cloth and mild soap. For more extensive grime, follow the full hand washing method.
*   **Consistent Cleaning:** Regular cleaning prevents dirt from becoming embedded.

I once got oil on my favorite knit running shoes. I used cornstarch immediately. It pulled most of the oil out before I even washed them. Quick action really helps with stains. For general dirt, I find that a simple wipe-down after each use helps prevent significant build-up. This keeps my knit shoes looking fresh for longer.

## Proper Drying Techniques for Knit Shoes

Drying your knit shoes correctly is as important as cleaning them. Improper drying can lead to several problems. These include shrinking, stretching, or mildew growth. It can also cause odors if moisture remains trapped. Always prioritize air drying for knit footwear.

Follow these steps for proper drying:

1.  **Blot Excess Water:** After washing, gently pat down the entire shoe with a clean, dry towel. This removes as much surface moisture as possible. Do not wring or twist the shoes.
2.  **Stuff with Paper Towels or Shoe Trees:** Stuff the inside of each shoe with clean, white paper towels. You can also use shoe trees. The paper towels absorb remaining moisture from the inside. They also help the shoes keep their original shape as they dry. Change the paper towels every few hours if they become saturated. Do not use newspaper, as the ink can transfer and stain your shoes.
3.  **Air Dry in a Well-Ventilated Area:** Place the stuffed shoes in a well-ventilated area. Choose a spot away from direct sunlight or heat sources. A fan can help circulate air and speed up drying. Avoid placing them near radiators, heaters, or in direct sun. High heat can cause the knit material to shrink or damage its fibers. Direct sunlight can also cause discoloration, especially for white or brightly colored shoes.
4.  **Position for Airflow:** Lay the shoes on their sides or prop them up. This allows air to circulate around all parts of the shoe. Ensure both the inside and outside of the shoe get good airflow.
5.  **Be Patient:** Knit shoes can take 24-48 hours to dry completely. The drying time depends on the shoe's thickness and humidity levels. Make sure they are fully dry before wearing them again. Wearing damp shoes can lead to unpleasant smells. If your shoes often smell, consider strategies from our guide on [how to clean smelly shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes) for prevention.

I always air dry my knit shoes. I put them near an open window or a fan. This ensures they dry thoroughly. This also helps them keep their shape. Never rush the drying process for knit footwear.

## Post-Cleaning Care and Protection for Knit Shoes

Once your knit shoes are clean and completely dry, consider some post-cleaning care. These steps help maintain their appearance and extend their life. Proper protection can also reduce how often you need to deep clean them.

Here are important post-cleaning and protection tips:

1.  **Re-lace and Reinsert Insoles:** Once your shoes are fully dry, put the clean laces back in. Insert the cleaned insoles back into the shoes. Your shoes are now ready to wear.
2.  **Apply a Water and Stain Repellent Spray:** For added protection, apply a water and stain repellent spray designed for fabric shoes. These sprays create a barrier on the surface of the knit. This barrier helps repel water and prevent stains from setting in. Follow the product instructions carefully. Apply in a well-ventilated area. This step is particularly helpful for light-colored knit shoes. It keeps them cleaner for longer.
3.  **Store Properly:** When not wearing your knit shoes, store them in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight or extreme temperatures. Keep them in their original box or a shoe bag to protect them from dust. Storing shoes correctly prevents unnecessary wear and keeps them fresh.
4.  **Rotate Your Shoes:** If you have multiple pairs of shoes, rotate them. Giving your knit shoes a break allows them to fully air out between wears. This helps prevent odors and extends their lifespan.
5.  **Address Minor Dirt Quickly:** Do not wait for your knit shoes to get very dirty. A quick wipe-down with a damp cloth after each use can prevent dirt buildup. This minor effort saves you from needing more intense cleaning later. For example, if you own white mesh tennis shoes, regular quick cleanings are key. You can find more tips on [how to clean white mesh tennis shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-mesh-tennis-shoes) that apply to general knit care.
6.  **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Continue to avoid harsh cleaning agents, bleach, or solvents on your knit shoes. These can damage the delicate fibers and affect their color.

I always spray my clean knit shoes with a protector. It truly helps repel everyday splashes. This simple step makes a big difference in keeping my shoes looking pristine. Taking these extra steps ensures your knit shoes stay in excellent condition for a long time.

## Preventing Future Stains and Damage to Knit Shoes

Prevention is the best approach when it comes to keeping your knit shoes clean. Taking proactive steps can significantly reduce how often you need to deep clean them. It also helps preserve their original look and feel. A little effort now saves a lot of cleaning later.

Consider these preventative measures:

1.  **Apply a Protective Spray Regularly:** As mentioned, a good quality water and stain repellent spray is your first line of defense. Reapply it every few months, especially if you wear the shoes often. This creates an invisible barrier against liquids and dirt.
2.  **Wear in Appropriate Conditions:** Try to avoid wearing your knit shoes in heavy rain, mud, or very dusty environments. Knit materials are not designed for extreme conditions. They absorb water and dirt easily. Choose other footwear for rougher terrains or bad weather.
3.  **Clean Spills Immediately:** If you spill something on your knit shoes, act fast. Blot the spill with a clean cloth immediately. Do not rub it in. The quicker you address a fresh stain, the easier it is to remove.
4.  **Use Shoe Horns:** Using a shoe horn when putting on your shoes helps prevent stretching the collar and heel area. This maintains the shoe's shape and integrity over time.
5.  **Store Properly:** Store your shoes in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. Use shoe trees or stuff them with acid-free paper to help them maintain their shape. Proper storage prevents dust buildup and accidental damage.
6.  **Rotate Your Footwear:** Give your knit shoes a break between wears. This allows them to air out completely. It helps prevent odor buildup and extends the life of the material.
7.  **Regular Light Cleaning:** Do not wait for your shoes to become heavily soiled. A quick wipe-down with a damp cloth after each wear, especially around the sole and any dirty spots, can keep them looking fresh. This prevents dirt from setting in. This method is similar to how one might keep [white converse shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-converse-shoes) clean daily.

I make it a habit to check my knit shoes after every use. A quick brush or wipe prevents small issues from becoming big problems. This consistent care keeps my knit shoes looking new.

### FAQ Section

**Q1: Can I put my knit shoes in the dryer?**
No, you should never put knit shoes in a machine dryer. High heat can cause the knit material to shrink, warp, or damage its delicate fibers. It can also melt glues or deform the shoe's structure. Always air dry your knit shoes by stuffing them with paper towels and placing them in a well-ventilated area away from direct heat.

**Q2: How often should I clean my knit shoes?**
The frequency depends on how often you wear them and how dirty they get. For light use, a quick wipe-down after each wear is enough. For moderate use or visible dirt, clean them every few weeks. If they are heavily soiled, clean them immediately. Regular light cleaning prevents dirt from embedding deeply.

**Q3: What kind of soap is best for cleaning knit shoes?**
A mild liquid laundry detergent, gentle dish soap, or a dedicated shoe cleaner designed for delicate fabrics works best. Avoid harsh chemicals, bleach, or strong stain removers. These can damage the knit fibers, cause discoloration, or leave residue. Always dilute the soap in water before applying.

**Q4: Can I use a magic eraser on knit shoes?**
You should use a magic eraser with extreme caution, if at all, on knit uppers. Magic erasers are abrasive and can damage delicate knit fibers, causing pilling or thinning. They are generally safe for cleaning rubber soles and midsoles. For knit material, stick to soft brushes and cloths.

**Q5: What if my knit shoes start to smell bad?**
If your knit shoes develop an odor, address it immediately. Remove insoles and let them air out completely. You can sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes and let it sit overnight to absorb odors. For persistent smells, you might need a dedicated shoe deodorizer spray. You can find more comprehensive advice in our guide on [how to clean smelly shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes).

**Q6: Is it better to hand wash or machine wash knit shoes?**
Hand washing is generally safer and more recommended for knit shoes. It provides better control and minimizes the risk of shrinking, stretching, or damage. Machine washing is an option for certain durable knit shoes, but always use a gentle cycle, cold water, and a mesh laundry bag with old towels for protection.
