### How do you clear Cloudkill in Baldur's Gate 3?

You can clear Cloudkill in Baldur's Gate 3 by using Dispel Magic on the cloud itself or on its caster's concentration. Moving characters out of the area effect is also effective. Gaining poison immunity or resistance helps your party endure the gas. Breaking the caster's concentration ends the spell immediately.

## Understanding Cloudkill: The Basics in BG3

Cloudkill is a potent spell in Baldur's Gate 3. It creates a large, opaque cloud of toxic gas. This cloud deals poison damage to creatures inside it. Understanding how Cloudkill works is the first step to clearing it. Knowing its basic properties helps you prepare for its dangers. This spell poses a significant threat in many encounters.

The cloud spreads and moves on its own. It obscures vision within its area. This makes ranged attacks very difficult or impossible. Enemies can hide inside the gas. Your party members take damage each turn they stay in it. Recognizing the spell's visual cues helps you react fast.

### Cloudkill's Mechanics

Cloudkill is a Concentration spell. This means the caster must maintain concentration for the spell to persist. If the caster takes damage and fails a Concentration saving throw, the spell ends. This is a key weakness you can exploit. The cloud itself moves slightly each turn. It can block pathways or cut off retreat routes.

The spell affects a large radius. It covers many characters at once. Its movement can sometimes be unpredictable. Always watch for the green gas on the battlefield. It signifies danger and requires a swift response. Knowing it is a concentration spell opens up specific counter tactics.

### Damage and Effects

Cloudkill deals 5d8 poison damage to any creature starting its turn inside the cloud. It deals this damage repeatedly. The damage adds up quickly. Characters without resistance or immunity will suffer greatly. The cloud also creates a Heavily Obscured area. This means creatures within it are Blinded.

Blinded creatures have Disadvantage on attack rolls. Attackers also have Advantage on attack rolls against them. This dual effect makes Cloudkill very dangerous. It harms you and protects enemies inside it. Clearing the cloud reduces both the damage and the vision penalty. This is why learning how to clear poison clouds is crucial.

## Direct Counters: Dispelling Cloudkill

Direct counters offer the fastest way to deal with Cloudkill. These methods remove the spell's effect entirely. Dispel Magic is the primary tool for this. It can instantly end ongoing magical effects. Using it correctly can turn the tide of a battle.

Other magical abilities can also achieve similar results. You must know which spells your party members have. Identify the character who can cast these spells. Prepare them for immediate use when Cloudkill appears. Timely dispelling prevents a lot of harm.

### Using Dispel Magic

Dispel Magic is a level 3 Abjuration spell. Many spellcasting classes can learn it. These include Wizards, Bards, Clerics, Druids, and Paladins. When you cast Dispel Magic on a Cloudkill cloud, it disappears. The spell ends instantly. This removes the damage and vision obstruction.

You must choose the correct spell level for Dispel Magic. Cloudkill is a level 5 spell. You need to use a level 5 spell slot or higher for Dispel Magic to guarantee success. Casting Dispel Magic at a lower level might fail. It works based on a dice roll. Always use the highest spell slot you can for important dispels.

### Other Dispelling Methods

Some unique items or character abilities may offer dispelling effects. For instance, specific magical artifacts might have a "Cleanse" or "Purify" effect. These can remove debuffs or environmental spells. Check your party's inventory for such items. They can be life-savers in tough spots.

Certain character subclasses might gain abilities that disrupt magic. A Paladin's Lay on Hands or a Cleric's Channel Divinity could remove conditions. While not direct dispels of the Cloudkill itself, they can remove the poisoned condition from allies. This helps manage the impact. Removing harmful area effects is important for battle control.

## Mitigating Cloudkill's Damage

Sometimes you cannot clear Cloudkill immediately. You need ways to reduce the damage your party takes. Mitigation strategies focus on protection. They make your characters tougher against poison. These methods buy you time or let you push through the gas. Preparation is key for enduring Cloudkill's effects.

Having resistance or immunity is very helpful. It means your characters take less or no damage. This allows them to stay in the cloud longer if needed. You can also boost their saving throws. Higher saving throws mean a better chance to resist the initial poison effect.

### Poison Resistance and Immunity

Poison resistance halves the damage taken from poison. Many races have natural poison resistance. These include Dwarves, Stout Halflings, and Tieflings. Consider these races for characters who might enter dangerous areas. This innate resistance is always active.

You can also gain poison resistance through spells or potions. The "Protection from Poison" spell grants resistance. It also cures any existing poisoned condition. Potions of Poison Resistance also provide this benefit. Some armor or accessories might offer poison resistance as well. Check your gear for these valuable properties. For full protection, look for poison immunity. Certain feats like "Tavern Brawler" for specific races, or class features, can grant immunity.

### Enhancing Saving Throws

Cloudkill forces a Constitution saving throw for half damage. Characters with high Constitution naturally perform better. You can further enhance saving throws. Spells like "Bless" add a 1d4 bonus to saving throws. This increases the chance of succeeding on the Constitution save.

Clerics and Paladins have abilities that boost saving throws. An Aura of Protection from a Paladin grants a Charisma bonus to nearby allies' saving throws. This makes your whole party more resilient. Items that boost Constitution or provide a bonus to saving throws are also useful. Equipping them before a tough fight helps a lot. Remember that a successful save halves the damage.

## Movement and Positioning Strategies

Smart movement is essential when dealing with Cloudkill. You can avoid the gas entirely or move through it with minimal harm. Positioning your characters correctly keeps them safe. Planning your turns prevents getting trapped in the cloud. Do not let the cloud limit your options.

Movement spells and abilities are extremely valuable. They allow your party to escape danger quickly. Environmental features can also play a role. Using height or choke points changes how the cloud affects the battle. Think about where your characters stand.

### Escaping the Cloud

The simplest way to clear Cloudkill's threat is to move out of it. Characters can use their movement speed to exit the gas. Pay attention to the cloud's movement. It shifts slightly each turn. Predict its path to avoid re-entering it.

Spells like "Misty Step" or "Dimension Door" offer instant escapes. They let characters teleport safely away from the gas. These spells are great for getting squishy casters or low-health characters out of harm's way. Jumping abilities also help traverse difficult terrain. They can clear small gaps or elevated positions to bypass the cloud. Consider the "Mobile" feat for increased movement speed. This helps characters get out faster.

### Using Environmental Advantages

Cloudkill often appears in specific locations. Use the environment to your advantage. High ground can sometimes prevent the cloud from reaching you. Enemies might be forced to move through the gas to attack. You can use narrow passages to limit the cloud's spread.

Forced movement spells are also powerful. A "Thorn Whip" from a Druid can pull an enemy out of the cloud. A "Gust of Wind" spell can even push the cloud itself. This is very effective for clearing specific areas. You can push enemies into the cloud or pull them out. This makes for dynamic and flexible combat.

## Environmental Interactions and Exploitation

Cloudkill is a gas spell. It interacts with the environment in interesting ways. Understanding these interactions gives you more tactical options. You can use fire or wind spells to alter the battlefield. This can clear parts of the cloud or make it even more dangerous for enemies.

Exploiting these interactions requires careful planning. You need to know which spells your party has. Coordinate your actions for maximum effect. This adds another layer to your combat strategy. Environmental effects can be powerful allies.

### Wind and Fire Effects

A strong gust of wind can clear the Cloudkill. Spells like "Gust of Wind" or certain wind-based elemental attacks can disperse the gas. This creates clear pathways. It also removes the damage threat. Watch for environmental objects like windmills or strong currents that might provide natural wind.

Cloudkill is also combustible. If fire damage touches the Cloudkill, it might explode. This deals fire damage in a smaller area. It consumes part of the gas. You can use spells like "Fireball" or "Fire Bolt" to trigger this. This can be a double-edged sword. Make sure your party is not in the explosion radius. It can clear a section of the cloud while dealing burst damage.

### Pushing Enemies Out (or into)

Using forced movement spells is a great way to control the battlefield. You can push enemies out of the Cloudkill. This removes their protection from the obscured area. It also makes them vulnerable to your attacks. Spells like "Thunderwave" or "Eldritch Blast" with Repelling Blast can do this.

Conversely, you can push enemies *into* the Cloudkill. This exposes them to repeated poison damage. It forces them to make saving throws. This strategy is especially useful if your party has poison immunity. You can stand in the gas and push enemies into it. Then, they suffer while you are safe. This is part of dealing with toxic gas and manipulating hazardous areas.

## Character Builds for Cloudkill Encounters

Certain character builds naturally excel against Cloudkill. Their abilities, spells, and proficiencies give them an advantage. Planning your party composition helps you face such threats. You can build a team that counters Cloudkill easily. Focus on classes with dispelling, defensive, or mobility options.

A balanced party often performs best. Include characters who can deal with magic and physical threats. Prioritize characters with good Constitution. They will have an easier time with the saving throws. Consider specific gear choices during character creation and leveling.

### Recommended Spells and Abilities

*   **Dispel Magic:** Essential for all spellcasters who can learn it. Prioritize it for Wizards, Bards, and Clerics.
*   **Protection from Poison:** A low-level spell that grants resistance. Clerics and Druids can cast this.
*   **Misty Step/Dimension Door:** Crucial mobility spells for quick escapes. Many classes get access, often through feats or specific items.
*   **Gust of Wind:** A Druid or Sorcerer spell that can clear the gas.
*   **Counterspell:** Prevents the enemy from casting Cloudkill in the first place. Wizards and Sorcerers are good at this.
*   **Lay on Hands (Paladin):** Can cure the poisoned condition from an ally.
*   **Aura of Protection (Paladin):** Provides a saving throw bonus to nearby allies.

### Key Character Attributes

*   **Constitution:** High Constitution helps pass the saving throw against Cloudkill's poison. It also grants more hit points. This means characters can endure more damage overall.
*   **Wisdom/Charisma/Intelligence (for Spellcasters):** These attributes determine the success of your Dispel Magic. Higher casting modifier means better chance to dispel higher level spells.
*   **Dexterity:** High Dexterity helps with initiative. It allows characters to act earlier. This lets them move out of the cloud before taking damage.

Equip characters with items that provide poison resistance or immunity. A character with "Athlete" feat can jump further. This helps navigate the battlefield. Look for equipment that boosts saving throws. These small bonuses add up.

## Advanced Tactics Against Cloudkill Casters

The most effective way to clear Cloudkill is to stop it before it starts. Or, you can end it quickly by targeting the caster. Cloudkill is a Concentration spell. Breaking the caster's concentration ends the spell immediately. This is often faster than dispelling the cloud directly.

This tactic requires focus and good damage output. You need to identify the caster. Then, you must reach them and hit them hard. Using crowd control spells can also help. They can prevent the caster from acting.

### Breaking Concentration

Casters lose concentration if they take damage and fail a Constitution saving throw. Focus your attacks on the Cloudkill caster. Use high-damage spells or attacks. Multi-attack characters like Fighters or Rangers can make several attempts. Each hit forces a new saving throw. This increases the chance of breaking concentration.

Spells that stun, prone, or paralyze the caster are also effective. A stunned caster cannot concentrate. They also cannot cast other spells. "Hold Person" or "Tasha's Hideous Laughter" can incapacitate them. This stops Cloudkill and other spells. Aim to take them down quickly.

### Silencing Spellcasters

A silenced caster cannot cast spells. This is the ultimate counter to any spellcaster. The "Silence" spell creates an area where no sounds can be made. This prevents casting spells with Verbal components. Cloudkill requires Verbal components. Casting Silence on the enemy spellcaster completely shuts them down.

Place the Silence sphere directly on the caster. This forces them to move out of it. If they stay, they cannot cast. This gives your party time to move or position. Silence is an excellent tool for controlling any dangerous spellcaster. It is a powerful way of removing harmful area effects by stopping the source.
