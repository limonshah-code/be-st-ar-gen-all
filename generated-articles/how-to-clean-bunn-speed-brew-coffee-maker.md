## Keep Your Brew Fresh: How To Clean Bunn Speed Brew Coffee Maker

A fresh cup of coffee starts your day right. Your Bunn Speed Brew coffee maker delivers that brew quickly. But even the fastest coffee makers need regular care. Coffee oils and minerals build up inside the machine. This buildup affects taste and machine life. I know because I have seen it happen.

Cleaning your Bunn Speed Brew coffee maker is simple. It helps your coffee taste great. It also makes your machine last longer. This guide will show you how. We will cover daily checks, weekly tasks, and deep cleaning steps. You will learn how to descale your Bunn machine. Let's make your coffee experience better.

### Takeaway

*   **Daily Care:** Wipe the exterior, rinse the brew funnel and carafe after each use.
*   **Weekly Wash:** Clean removable parts with mild soap and water.
*   **Monthly Deep Clean:** Run a vinegar or descaling solution cycle. Clean the spray head.

Clean the spray head and wipe down the exterior often.

## Why Your Bunn Speed Brew Needs Regular Cleaning

Your Bunn Speed Brew coffee maker works hard. It heats water fast and brews coffee quickly. Over time, coffee oils and hard water minerals build up inside it. These substances affect how your coffee tastes. They also impact the machine's performance.

Coffee oils leave a residue. This residue makes coffee taste bitter or stale. Minerals from water, like calcium, form scale. This scale slows down water flow. It can clog internal parts. You might notice your coffee tastes flat. The machine might also brew slower than usual. This is a sign it needs cleaning.

Mold can also grow in damp areas of a coffee maker. This happens if you do not dry parts well. Mold affects health and coffee taste. Regular cleaning prevents these issues. It ensures your coffee stays pure and flavorful. A clean machine brews better coffee.

Keeping your machine clean extends its life. Buildup makes the machine work harder. This causes wear and tear. Proper cleaning removes stress from internal components. It helps your Bunn Speed Brew last many years. I always tell my friends to keep their machines clean.

## Essential Cleaning Supplies for Your Bunn Coffee Maker

You do not need many special items to clean your Bunn Speed Brew. Most supplies are already in your kitchen. Gathering them first makes the cleaning process smooth. Simple tools work best for this task. I always check my cleaning cabinet before I start.

White vinegar is your main cleaning agent. It is great for cutting through coffee oils. It also dissolves mineral deposits. Look for plain white vinegar, not apple cider or balsamic. You will also need mild dish soap. This soap helps clean removable parts.

Soft cloths or sponges are important. They will wipe down surfaces. They clean without scratching your machine. Avoid abrasive scrubbers. A small brush or pipe cleaner helps. These items clean the spray head holes. Small brushes can reach tight spots.

Always avoid harsh chemical cleaners. These products can damage your machine. They also leave harmful residues. These residues can affect your coffee's taste and safety. Stick to natural solutions like vinegar and soap. For an alternative cleaning method, you can explore using baking soda. Learn more in our article about [how to clean a coffee maker with baking soda](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-coffee-maker-with-baking-soda).

You may also want a measuring cup. This helps you get the right amount of vinegar. A large sink or basin is good for rinsing parts. Having these items ready saves time. It makes cleaning your Bunn coffee maker easy.

## Daily and Weekly Care for Your Bunn Speed Brew

Consistent care keeps your Bunn Speed Brew in top shape. Daily and weekly cleaning prevents major buildup. This routine is simple and takes little time. It stops problems before they start. I follow these steps every day.

### After Each Brew

You just made your coffee. Now, take a moment to clean. First, remove the used coffee grounds. Discard them properly. Then, rinse the brew funnel under warm water. Make sure no coffee residue remains.

Wash the glass carafe. Use warm water and a little dish soap. Rinse it well. Dry it completely before putting it back. Wipe down the exterior of your Bunn coffee maker. A damp cloth removes splashes and dust. This keeps your machine looking good.

### Weekly Tasks

Once a week, do a slightly deeper clean. Take out the brew funnel and the carafe. Wash them thoroughly with mild dish soap and warm water. Pay attention to any coffee stains. You can use a soft brush if needed. For specific tips on cleaning your coffee pot, refer to our guide on [how to clean a Bunn coffee pot](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bunn-coffee-pot).

Wipe down the warming plate. Spilled coffee can burn onto this surface. Use a damp cloth to remove any stains. If stains are stubborn, a paste of baking soda and water can help. Gently scrub, then wipe clean. Check the area around the water reservoir lid. Clean any dust or residue there. Regular cleaning keeps your machine ready for your next brew. This process is similar for most drip machines. You can find more general tips in our article about [how to clean a drip coffee maker](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-drip-coffee-maker).

## Deep Cleaning Your Bunn Speed Brew Coffee Maker

Deep cleaning is essential for your Bunn Speed Brew. This process removes hidden coffee oils and early mineral deposits. I recommend doing this once a month. It helps your coffee taste fresh and clean. This is more involved than daily rinsing.

First, make sure your coffee maker is cool. Empty the water reservoir completely. Remove the brew funnel and the carafe. Set them aside for now. You will clean these separately later.

Now, prepare your cleaning solution. Fill the carafe with one part white vinegar and two parts water. For example, if your carafe holds 10 cups, use about 3 cups of vinegar and 7 cups of water. Pour this mixture into the machine's water reservoir.

Place the empty carafe on the warming plate. Lift the brew funnel lid. Make sure no paper filter or coffee grounds are present. Close the lid. Now, start a brew cycle. Let the machine run the entire cycle. The vinegar solution will clean the internal tubes.

Once the cycle finishes, empty the carafe. Repeat this process with plain, clean water. Do this at least two full cycles. This rinses out all the vinegar. The machine should smell clean, not like vinegar. A clean machine delivers the best coffee flavor.

### Cleaning the Spray Head

The spray head is crucial. It disperses hot water over coffee grounds. Mineral buildup can clog its tiny holes. This affects brewing performance. My machine often runs better after cleaning this part.

First, turn off and unplug your Bunn Speed Brew. Locate the spray head. It is usually above where the brew funnel sits. Most Bunn spray heads twist or pull off easily. Refer to your manual if you have trouble.

Once removed, inspect the spray head. You will see small holes. Use a small brush or a paperclip to clear any clogs. Gently poke through each hole. Rinse the spray head under running water. Make sure water flows freely through all holes.

If the spray head is very dirty, soak it. Place it in a small bowl of vinegar. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes. This helps loosen stubborn buildup. After soaking, scrub it gently. Rinse it again thoroughly. Reattach the clean spray head to your Bunn. Ensure it snaps or twists securely into place. This step significantly improves brewing. If you use a reusable coffee filter, remember to clean it thoroughly too. Our guide on [how to clean a coffee filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-coffee-filter) provides detailed instructions.

## Descaling Your Bunn Speed Brew with Vinegar

Descaling removes stubborn mineral buildup. This buildup is called scale. It comes from hard water. Scale can block heating elements and water lines. It is different from coffee oil cleaning. Descaling is vital for machine health. I descale my machine quarterly or every three months. If you live in an area with very hard water, you might need to do it more often.

First, turn off and unplug your Bunn Speed Brew coffee maker. Ensure the machine is cool. Empty the water reservoir completely. You want to start fresh with no leftover water. Remove the brew funnel and carafe.

Now, create your descaling solution. For Bunn machines, white vinegar works well. Fill the carafe with undiluted white vinegar. Do not add water for this step. Pour the pure vinegar into the machine's water reservoir. Place the empty carafe on the warming plate.

Start a brew cycle. Allow the entire cycle to run. The hot vinegar will flow through the internal system. It dissolves mineral deposits. You might see some flakes in the carafe. This is normal. It is the scale breaking down.

After the first cycle, turn off the machine. Let the vinegar sit in the internal tank for 30 minutes to an hour. This soak helps break down tough scale. Do not leave the vinegar in for too long, as it can damage seals over many hours.

After soaking, turn the machine back on. Run another full cycle of the remaining vinegar. Once this finishes, empty the carafe. Now, you must rinse the machine thoroughly. Fill the reservoir with plain, clean water. Run at least three full cycles of plain water. This flushes out all the vinegar and loosened scale. Your machine should no longer smell like vinegar. It is now ready to brew fresh coffee.

## Addressing Stubborn Issues: Mold and Coffee Stains

Sometimes, regular cleaning is not enough. Your Bunn Speed Brew might develop mold or stubborn coffee stains. These issues need extra attention. It is important to address them quickly. I faced these issues myself once.

### Dealing with Mold

Mold thrives in damp, dark environments. Coffee makers can be a perfect home for it. You might see black or green spots. These spots indicate mold growth. It usually appears in the water reservoir or brew funnel. Mold is harmful and affects coffee taste.

To clean mold, unplug the machine. Empty all water. If mold is in the water reservoir, fill it with a mixture of one part white vinegar and one part water. Let this sit for 30 minutes. For severe mold, you can use a very diluted bleach solution. Use one teaspoon of bleach per gallon of water. Pour this into the reservoir.

Run the solution through a full brew cycle. Be sure no coffee grounds are in the brew funnel. After the cycle, empty the carafe. Then, run at least five full cycles with plain, clean water. This step is critical to remove all bleach residue. I cannot stress enough the importance of rinsing well. Always ensure proper ventilation when using bleach.

For mold on removable parts like the brew funnel, scrub them. Use a brush and a solution of hot water and dish soap. If mold persists, soak them in the vinegar or diluted bleach solution. Rinse thoroughly before reassembling. For more detailed steps on mold removal from coffee makers, you can refer to our specific guide on [how to clean mold out of a coffee maker](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-out-of-coffee-maker).

### Removing Coffee Stains

External coffee stains are common. They happen from spills or drips. These stains can make your Bunn Speed Brew look dirty. Glass carafes are also prone to stains. Regular wiping prevents most of them.

For external stains on the machine body, use a damp cloth. A little mild dish soap on the cloth works wonders. Gently wipe the stained area. Avoid harsh scrubbers. They can scratch the plastic or metal finish.

For stubborn stains on the carafe, baking soda is effective. Make a paste with baking soda and a little water. Apply the paste to the stained area inside the carafe. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Then, scrub with a soft brush or sponge. The abrasive nature of baking soda helps lift the stains. Rinse the carafe completely afterward.

You can also use a mixture of salt and ice in the carafe. Swirl it around vigorously. The ice and salt act as a gentle abrasive. This helps remove stubborn rings. Wash and rinse the carafe thoroughly after any method. Keeping surfaces clean enhances the look of your machine.

## Maintaining Optimal Performance: Tips for Your Bunn Speed Brew

Proper maintenance goes beyond just cleaning. It involves habits that keep your Bunn Speed Brew coffee maker running efficiently. These tips help ensure long life and great coffee flavor. I have learned these through years of coffee brewing.

### Use Filtered Water

The quality of your water directly impacts your coffee maker. Hard water contains minerals. These minerals cause scale buildup. Using filtered water reduces this problem. It lessens the frequency of descaling. Filtered water also improves coffee taste. It removes chlorine and other impurities. I always fill my Bunn with filtered water.

### Avoid Abrasive Cleaners

Never use harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbing pads. These products can damage your machine. They scratch surfaces and degrade internal components. Stick to mild soap, white vinegar, and soft cloths. Damage to parts can cause leaks or machine failure. Keep your cleaning gentle.

### Regularly Check Seals and Hoses

Inspect your Bunn Speed Brew periodically. Look for signs of wear on seals and hoses. These parts can crack over time. A damaged seal can lead to leaks. Hoses can also get stiff or brittle. Early detection of problems prevents bigger issues. If you notice any damage, consult Bunn's support.

### Store Machine Properly

If you plan not to use your coffee maker for a while, store it right. First, clean it thoroughly. Make sure it is completely dry inside and out. Water left in the tank can lead to mold. Store it in a cool, dry place. Protect it from dust and extreme temperatures. Proper storage keeps your machine ready for its next use.

### Do Not Let Water Sit Too Long

Bunn Speed Brew machines have a hot water tank. This tank keeps water hot for instant brewing. While convenient, water should not sit indefinitely. If you go away for several days, drain the tank. This prevents water from becoming stale. It also reduces the chance of mold or mineral buildup. Just unplug the machine and let it cool. Then, drain the internal tank by running brew cycles until empty.
