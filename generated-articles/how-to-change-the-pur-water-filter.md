## Change Your PUR Water Filter with Ease

A refreshing glass of water makes a good day even better. But is your water truly clean? Over time, your PUR water filter works hard to remove impurities. A worn-out filter stops doing its job. This means you might drink water with unwanted substances. Knowing how to change the PUR water filter ensures you always get pure, great-tasting water.

This guide helps you replace your PUR water filter quickly. We cover why filter changes matter and how often you should do it. I will explain the simple steps for changing various PUR filter types. You will also learn about filter indicators and what to do if you face a small problem. Let's make sure your water stays clean and safe.

### Takeaway

*   Replace your PUR filter regularly for clean, safe water.
*   Follow specific steps for different PUR models.
*   Monitor filter life indicators to know when to change.

Changing your PUR water filter involves simple steps. First, remove the old filter from its housing. Then, prepare the new filter by soaking or rinsing it, depending on the model. Finally, insert the new filter firmly into place until it clicks or twists securely. Flush a few liters of water through the system to activate the new filter.

## Why Your PUR Filter Needs Regular Changes

Your PUR water filter serves a vital purpose. It captures harmful contaminants from your tap water. These include chlorine, lead, mercury, and certain pesticides. The filter media inside the cartridge traps these substances. As water flows through, the filter cleans it.

However, filters have a limited capacity. They cannot hold impurities forever. Over time, the filter media becomes saturated. It fills up with all the things it has removed from your water. When this happens, the filter stops working well. It can no longer effectively clean your water. In some cases, a very old filter might even release trapped contaminants back into your water. This defeats the purpose of having a filter. Regular changes keep your water clean and safe.

## How Often to Change Your PUR Water Filter

Knowing when to change your PUR water filter is important. The exact timing depends on your specific PUR model and how much water you use. Most PUR pitcher and dispenser filters last about two months. They filter roughly 40 gallons of water. Faucet mount filters often last longer. These typically need changing every three months. They filter around 100 gallons.

Your PUR system often has an electronic indicator. This light tells you when it is time for a new filter. A green light means the filter is working. A yellow light means it is time to think about changing it soon. A red light means you need to change the filter now. Even without an indicator, pay attention to water taste and flow. If your water tastes off or flows slowly, it is probably time for a new filter.

## Types of PUR Filters and Their Replacement Methods

PUR offers various water filtration systems. Each system uses a specific filter type. The replacement process varies slightly for each. Understanding your specific PUR product helps you change its filter correctly.

### Changing PUR Pitcher and Dispenser Filters

PUR pitchers and dispensers are popular choices for filtered water. Their filters are easy to replace. I have done this many times in my own kitchen.

*   **Prepare the new filter:** First, take your new PUR filter out of its packaging. Hold it under cold tap water. Rinse it for about 15 seconds. This helps remove any loose carbon dust.
*   **Remove the old filter:** Take the lid off your PUR pitcher or dispenser. Carefully pull the old filter straight up from its housing. It should slide out easily.
*   **Insert the new filter:** Line up the new filter with the opening in the pitcher's reservoir. Push it down firmly. You will feel or hear it click into place. Make sure it sits snugly.
*   **Prime the filter:** Fill the reservoir with cold tap water. Let the water filter through completely. Discard the first two full pitchers of filtered water. This primes the filter and removes any remaining carbon dust. Your filtered water is now ready to drink.

### Replacing PUR Faucet Mount Filters

PUR faucet mount filters attach directly to your kitchen tap. They provide filtered water on demand. Changing these filters is also straightforward.

*   **Remove the old filter:** Locate the filter housing on your faucet mount. There is usually a release button or a twist mechanism. Press the button or twist the cap to detach the old filter cartridge. Pull it away from the unit.
*   **Prepare the new filter:** Unwrap your new PUR faucet filter. Rinse it under cold water for about 15 seconds. This prepares the filter for use.
*   **Install the new filter:** Line up the new filter with the faucet mount unit. Push it into place firmly. You will hear a click or feel it lock securely. Some models require a twist to lock.
*   **Flush the system:** Turn on the cold water. Let the water run through the filter for five minutes. This flushes out air and carbon particles. Your filtered water is now ready to use for drinking or cooking.

## Step-by-Step Guide for PUR Basic Faucet Filter Replacement

Changing your PUR Basic faucet filter is a quick task. I find this one of the simplest home maintenance jobs. Follow these steps for a smooth replacement.

1.  **Turn off the water:** First, make sure your faucet is off. This prevents water from spraying when you remove the old filter.
2.  **Locate the filter housing:** The filter cartridge sits in the main body of the PUR faucet mount.
3.  **Remove the old filter:** On most PUR Basic models, you will see a small lever or button on the side of the filter unit. Push this button in. Gently pull the filter cartridge straight down and out. It should detach easily.
4.  **Prepare the new filter:** Unwrap your new PUR Basic filter. Hold it under cold running water for 15 seconds. This helps activate the filter media.
5.  **Insert the new filter:** Line up the new filter with the opening in the faucet mount. Push it firmly upwards until you hear a click. This click confirms it is securely in place.
6.  **Reset the filter indicator:** If your model has an electronic filter life indicator, reset it. Usually, you press and hold a button on the unit for a few seconds. The light should turn green.
7.  **Flush the filter:** Turn on the cold water. Let it run through the filter for five minutes. This purges air from the system. It also flushes out any harmless carbon dust. Your PUR Basic filter is now ready for use.

## Resetting Your PUR Filter Indicator Light

After you change the PUR water filter, you must reset the indicator light. This light tracks filter life. Resetting it ensures accurate future alerts.

For most PUR pitcher and dispenser models, the reset button is on the lid. Look for a small black button near the indicator light. Press and hold this button for five seconds. The light will typically flash green and then stay green. This means the filter counter has reset.

For PUR faucet mount systems, the reset button is usually on the main unit. It is often a small, circular button. Press and hold this button for about five seconds. The light will change from red or yellow to green. This tells you the system recognizes the new filter. Always reset the indicator after a filter change. This helps you keep track of when your next filter change is due.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting After Changing Your PUR Filter

Sometimes, you might encounter a small problem after changing your PUR water filter. Do not worry. Most issues have simple solutions. We can fix them together. For more detailed solutions, consult our [PUR water filter troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/pur-water-filter-troubleshooting) guide.

*   **Slow Water Flow:** This is a common issue. It usually means the filter needs more priming. Turn off the water. Remove the filter. Re-rinse it under cold water for a full minute. Reinsert the filter firmly. Then, run water through it for ten minutes instead of five. This helps remove air bubbles.
*   **Water Tastes Odd:** A new filter might release harmless carbon dust. This can give water a slightly different taste initially. Flush more water through the filter. Discard several more liters. The taste should improve after a few uses. If the taste persists, double-check that you installed the filter correctly.
*   **Indicator Light Not Resetting:** Make sure you press and hold the reset button long enough. Some models need a firm, continuous press. If it still does not reset, try removing and reinserting the filter, then attempt the reset again. The contacts might need to be fully engaged.
*   **Leaking from Faucet Mount:** If your faucet mount leaks after a filter change, the new filter might not be seated properly. Turn off the water. Remove the filter. Check the rubber gasket on the filter for any damage. Reinsert the filter, ensuring it clicks or twists securely into place. Make sure no debris blocks the seal.

Remember, most PUR filters are designed for easy replacement. They are not meant to be cleaned. Attempting to clean them can damage the filter media. This can make the filter ineffective. Filters like PUR are meant for one-time use and replacement. They differ from some other types of filters that can be cleaned. You can find general information about [how to clean water filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-water-filter) for comparison, but remember, this does not apply to PUR filters.

## Maximizing the Life of Your New PUR Filter

You want your new PUR filter to last as long as possible. Good practices can help.

*   **Use Cold Water:** Always use cold water when filtering. Hot water can damage the filter media. It also speeds up the degradation of the filter components. Running hot water through the filter will reduce its lifespan significantly.
*   **Avoid Excessive Use:** While filters are for regular use, be mindful of unusually high water usage. For instance, do not use filtered water for tasks like filling a large bathtub. Save filtered water for drinking, cooking, and making ice.
*   **Proper Storage:** If you buy filters in bulk, store them in a cool, dry place. Keep them in their original sealed packaging. This protects them from dust and damage until you need them. Do not store filters in direct sunlight or extreme temperatures.
*   **Regular Cleaning of the System:** While you do not clean the filter itself, clean the pitcher or dispenser regularly. Wash the pitcher or dispenser with warm, soapy water. Rinse it thoroughly. This prevents buildup in the unit. A clean housing helps the new filter work best. This does not extend the filter life, but it ensures a clean system overall.

## Benefits of Using Clean, Filtered Water

Using clean, filtered water offers many benefits. It is not just about taste. It also impacts your health and well-being.

*   **Improved Taste and Odor:** Tap water can have a chlorine taste or other unpleasant odors. Filters remove these. This makes water much more enjoyable to drink. You will find yourself drinking more water throughout the day.
*   **Removal of Contaminants:** Filters reduce lead, mercury, pesticides, and industrial pollutants. These substances can be harmful if consumed over time. Filtering provides a safer drinking option. It gives me peace of mind knowing my family drinks cleaner water.
*   **Healthier Hydration:** When water tastes good and is free from impurities, you are more likely to drink enough. Good hydration helps with energy levels. It supports healthy skin. It also helps with organ function.
*   **Cost Savings:** Buying bottled water can be expensive. A PUR filter provides clean water at a fraction of the cost. It also reduces plastic waste from single-use bottles. This is good for your wallet and the environment.
