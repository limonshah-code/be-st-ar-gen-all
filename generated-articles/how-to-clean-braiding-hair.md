## How To Clean Braiding Hair: Keep Your Styles Fresh

Braiding hair, whether it is synthetic or human, forms the foundation of many beautiful protective styles. These styles include box braids, knotless braids, twists, and faux locs. You invest time and money into getting these looks. Therefore, you want them to last. Knowing how to clean braiding hair properly is essential for this. It keeps your braids fresh, extends their life, and maintains good scalp health. Ignoring cleanliness can lead to odors, buildup, and even scalp issues. This guide provides clear steps to clean braiding hair effectively, addressing different hair types and situations. We will cover pre-installation preparation, deep cleaning after removal, and maintaining braids while they are installed.

### Takeaway

*   **Prep New Hair:** Always pre-wash new braiding hair, especially synthetic types, to remove factory coatings and alkaline bases.
*   **Identify Hair Type:** Use different cleaning methods for synthetic and human braiding hair for best results.
*   **Clean While Installed:** Lightly clean braids and scalp when they are in place to manage odor and buildup.
*   **Deep Clean After Removal:** Perform a thorough wash on removed braiding hair to reuse it or to keep it sanitary.
*   **Dry Completely:** Ensure all braiding hair dries fully to prevent mildew and unpleasant smells.

### Clear Answer

To clean braiding hair, first determine if it is synthetic or human. For new synthetic hair, soak it in an apple cider vinegar rinse. For deep cleaning removed hair, detangle, wash with diluted shampoo, condition, and air dry completely. When cleaning installed braids, use a diluted cleanser on the scalp and pat the hair dry.

### Why Clean Braiding Hair? The Essentials of Hygiene and Longevity

Braiding hair, just like your natural hair, collects dirt, sweat, and product buildup. This accumulation happens whether the hair is in a style or waiting to be installed. Dirt and oil can cause your braids to look dull. They can also feel sticky. More importantly, this buildup can lead to scalp irritation. Your scalp needs to breathe. It also needs to be clean to stay healthy. A dirty scalp can itch. It can develop flaking. In some cases, it can even lead to bacterial or fungal issues.

Cleaning braiding hair is a key step for hygiene. It removes sweat from workouts. It takes away environmental dust and pollutants. It also lifts any residue from styling products you use. For hair that is still in its packaging, especially synthetic kinds, cleaning is also very important. New synthetic braiding hair often comes with an alkaline coating. This coating helps with packaging and prevents tangling. However, it can cause itching and irritation on your scalp. Pre-washing this hair removes these chemicals. It makes the hair safer and more comfortable to wear. This simple step prevents many common scalp problems.

Proper cleaning also makes your braids last longer. Dirt and grime can break down the hair fibers over time. This makes the braids look frizzy or old faster. By keeping them clean, you maintain the hair's integrity. Clean braids hold their shape better. They also look fresh for a longer period. This means you do not have to redo your protective style as often. You save time and money. Investing a little effort in cleaning braiding hair pays off. It gives you healthier hair and a more enduring style. Regular cleaning is a cornerstone of good hair care. It ensures your braids always look their best and your scalp stays happy.

### Understanding Your Braiding Hair Type: Synthetic vs. Human Hair

Before you begin cleaning any braiding hair, you must know its type. Braiding hair comes in two main categories: synthetic and human. Each type has unique characteristics. These characteristics affect how you should clean the hair. Using the wrong method can damage the hair. It can also make it unusable. Knowing the difference saves you time and effort. It also protects your investment.

Synthetic braiding hair is made from various plastic fibers. These fibers often include Kanekalon or Toyokalon. This type of hair is typically more affordable. It holds styles very well. However, synthetic hair is not porous like human hair. It does not absorb water and products in the same way. When wet, synthetic hair can become very heavy. It can also tangle easily. It is also more sensitive to heat. High heat can melt or damage synthetic fibers. Because of its plastic nature, synthetic hair can sometimes have a chemical smell. It might also have a coating from manufacturing. This coating needs removal before installation. Cleaning synthetic hair requires gentle handling. You should use mild products. Avoid hot water.

Human braiding hair is made from real human hair. It behaves much like the hair on your head. This type of hair is more expensive than synthetic options. It offers a more natural look and feel. Human hair can be washed, conditioned, and styled with heat. It is porous, so it absorbs products. It also tends to swell slightly when wet. Human hair can also collect product buildup and natural oils. It can also absorb environmental odors. Cleaning human hair is similar to washing your own hair. You can use standard shampoos and conditioners. You can be a bit more vigorous with washing. Always follow the product instructions. Understanding these differences is the first step. It helps you choose the correct cleaning process. This ensures your braiding hair stays in top condition.

### Pre-Installation Prep: Cleaning New Braiding Hair

You just bought new braiding hair. It feels exciting to plan your next style. However, do not put that hair directly onto your scalp. Pre-washing new braiding hair, especially synthetic hair, is a critical step. It helps prevent scalp irritation. Manufacturers often treat synthetic hair with an alkaline solution. This solution helps prevent mildew and makes the hair easier to package. However, this alkaline base can cause intense itching, flaking, and discomfort for many people. It can feel like an allergic reaction. Even human braiding hair can benefit from a pre-wash. It removes any processing chemicals or dust. Taking the time to prepare your hair will lead to a more comfortable and healthier wearing experience.

Here is a simple process for pre-washing new braiding hair:

*   **Gather Your Materials:** You will need a basin or large bowl, warm water, a gentle shampoo or dish soap, and **[How To Clean Hair With Apple Cider Vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hair-with-apple-cider-vinegar)**. Apple cider vinegar is excellent for removing alkaline coatings. You will also need a clean towel and a drying rack or clothesline.
*   **Prepare the Soak:** Fill your basin with warm water. Add about 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar for every gallon of water. You can also add a few drops of mild shampoo. The vinegar helps to neutralize the alkaline coating. It also breaks down other residues.
*   **Submerge the Hair:** Gently place the braiding hair into the solution. Ensure it is fully submerged. Let it soak for 15-30 minutes. If the water becomes discolored, this is normal. It means the coating is coming off. You can gently swish the hair around. Do not scrub it roughly.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** After soaking, remove the hair. Rinse it under cool running water. Rinse until the water runs clear. Make sure all soap and vinegar residue are gone. Residual product can cause itching.
*   **Condition (Optional for Synthetic, Recommended for Human):** For human braiding hair, apply a light conditioner. Rinse it out thoroughly. For synthetic hair, conditioning is usually not necessary. Some people use a very light fabric softener rinse for synthetic hair. This can reduce tangles and add softness. Rinse that out completely too.
*   **Dry Completely:** Squeeze out excess water gently. Do not wring the hair. Hang the hair to air dry. Use a clothes hanger or a towel rack. Make sure there is good air circulation. Allow the hair to dry completely before installation. This can take several hours or overnight. Ensure it is bone dry to prevent mildew.

This pre-wash makes a huge difference. It prepares the hair perfectly for your protective style. It ensures comfort from day one.

### Deep Cleaning Braiding Hair (After Removal)

You have worn your beautiful braids for weeks. Now, it is time to take them down. Do not throw away that braiding hair just yet. If you plan to reuse it, or even if you just want to dispose of it hygienically, deep cleaning is essential. Removed braiding hair holds a lot of history. It has scalp oils, product buildup, and environmental dirt. It can even harbor smells. A proper deep clean restores the hair. It makes it fresh and ready for storage or another use. This process focuses on thorough cleaning without causing damage.

Here is a detailed approach for deep cleaning braiding hair after removal:

*   **Detangle Gently:** Before wetting, try to detangle the hair. Use your fingers or a wide-tooth comb. Start from the ends and work your way up. This prevents tangles from tightening when wet. For a brush or comb, remember to regularly **[How To Clean Hair Combs](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hair-combs)** or **[How To Clean Plastic Hair Brushes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-plastic-hair-brushes)**. This is crucial for smooth detangling of your braids.
*   **Prepare the Wash Basin:** Fill a basin or sink with lukewarm water. Hot water can damage synthetic hair. It can also cause human hair to frizz. Add a small amount of clarifying shampoo. Use a shampoo designed to remove buildup. Alternatively, use a gentle dish soap for synthetic hair. Dish soap is very effective at cutting through grease and product residue.
*   **Wash the Hair:** Immerse sections of the braiding hair into the soapy water. Swish it gently. Do not scrub or agitate too much. This can cause tangling. Focus on squeezing the soap through the hair. You should see dirt and product residue coming off. Repeat with fresh soapy water if the first wash is very dirty. This step helps remove dirt, oils, and product buildup effectively.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** Remove the hair from the basin. Rinse it under cool running water. Ensure all shampoo or soap is gone. Rinse until the water runs clear. Any leftover product can make the hair feel sticky. It can also cause dullness.
*   **Condition (Especially for Human Hair):** For human braiding hair, apply a generous amount of moisturizing conditioner. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes. This helps restore moisture and softness. For synthetic hair, a light leave-in conditioner spray can help. You can also use a fabric softener diluted in water. Be sure to rinse this out too. This helps with softness and detangling.
*   **Final Rinse and Squeeze:** Rinse the conditioner out completely. Gently squeeze excess water from the hair. Do not twist or wring it.
*   **Air Dry:** Lay the hair flat on a clean towel. You can also hang it. Ensure it has good air circulation. Allow it to air dry completely. This might take 24-48 hours depending on the hair's thickness and humidity. Complete drying prevents mildew and odors. You can use a towel to gently blot moisture from the hair before hanging. This speeds up the drying process. Once dry, store it properly for future use.

### Cleaning Braiding Hair While Installed: Maintenance Tips

Keeping your braids clean while they are installed is different from pre-washing or deep cleaning removed hair. You cannot fully submerge your entire head in a basin. The goal here is to maintain scalp hygiene. You also want to refresh the braiding hair. This prevents itching, odors, and buildup. Regular maintenance extends the life of your protective style. It keeps your scalp healthy. It also ensures your braids look neat and presentable.

Here are ways to clean your braiding hair and scalp when it is installed:

*   **Targeted Scalp Cleaning:**
    *   **Diluted Shampoo Spray:** Mix a small amount of clarifying or anti-itch shampoo with water in a spray bottle. Section your braids. Spray the mixture directly onto your scalp. Gently massage your scalp with your fingertips. Do not use your nails. This lifts dirt and product buildup.
    *   **Cotton Swab Method:** For specific itchy spots, dip a cotton swab in witch hazel or diluted apple cider vinegar. Dab it onto the irritated area. This provides immediate relief. It also cleans the area.
    *   **Rinse:** Use a shower head with moderate pressure to rinse your scalp. Tilt your head back to avoid getting water into your face. Ensure all shampoo is rinsed out. You can also use a cup to pour water directly onto your scalp. If washing your hair sitting in a chair is more comfortable for you, this method works well to direct the water flow only to your scalp and braids without soaking your entire back.
*   **Refreshing the Braiding Hair:**
    *   **Light Wash:** After rinsing your scalp, you can lightly wash the braiding hair itself. Dilute a small amount of conditioner with water in a spray bottle. Spray it along the length of your braids. Gently squeeze the solution through the braids. This refreshes the hair. It also helps with any frizz. For general hair buildup, learning **[How To Clean Buildup On Hair Brush](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-buildup-on-hair-brush)** gives you an idea on how product residue accumulates on hair. This concept applies to braiding hair too.
    *   **Apple Cider Vinegar Rinse:** For odor or extra cleanliness, dilute **[How To Clean Hair With Apple Cider Vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hair-with-apple-cider-vinegar)**. Use 1 part ACV to 3 parts water. Spray it over your braids and scalp. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes. Then rinse thoroughly. This helps neutralize odors and balance scalp pH.
*   **Drying is Crucial:** This is the most important step for installed braids.
    *   **Towel Blotting:** Gently squeeze excess water from your braids with a clean towel. Pat the braids dry. Do not rub them vigorously.
    *   **Air Dry or Low Heat:** Allow your braids to air dry completely. This can take several hours. If you need to speed up drying, use a blow dryer on a cool or low-heat setting. Direct the airflow to your scalp first. Ensure your scalp is completely dry to prevent mildew. Mildew can cause unpleasant odors. It can also lead to fungal infections. Never go to bed with wet braids. This traps moisture and promotes mildew growth.
*   **Moisturize:** Once your braids are dry, apply a light hair oil or braid spray to your scalp. This keeps your scalp moisturized. It also prevents dryness and itching. A light oil on the braids can add shine.

By following these maintenance tips, you can enjoy your protective style for longer. You will also keep your scalp healthy and fresh.

### Odor Removal and Refreshing Braiding Hair

Sometimes, braiding hair can develop an unpleasant odor. This can happen whether it is new, installed, or removed. Odors come from various sources. These include factory chemicals, sweat, smoke, environmental pollutants, or product buildup. A smelly braid is not comfortable. It also undermines the clean look you want. Removing odors is a key part of refreshing your braiding hair. It makes the hair feel and smell clean again.

Here are effective strategies for tackling odors in braiding hair:

*   **For New Synthetic Hair (Factory Smell):**
    *   **Apple Cider Vinegar Soak:** This is the most effective method for new synthetic hair. Fill a basin with lukewarm water. Add about 1/2 cup of **[How To Clean Hair With Apple Cider Vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hair-with-apple-cider-vinegar)** for every gallon of water. Submerge the braiding hair and let it soak for 30 minutes to an hour. The acid in the vinegar neutralizes the alkaline coating and its associated smell. Rinse the hair thoroughly with cool water.
    *   **Baking Soda Paste (for stubborn areas):** Make a paste with baking soda and water. Apply it to specific sections of the hair. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Then rinse very well. Baking soda is a natural deodorizer. Learning **[How To Clean Hair Brushes Baking Soda](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hair-brushes-baking-soda)** shows baking soda's effectiveness as a cleaning agent for hair tools and applies to hair itself.
*   **For Installed Braids (Sweat/Environmental Odors):**
    *   **Diluted Isopropyl Alcohol Spray:** Mix 1 part isopropyl alcohol with 2 parts water in a spray bottle. Lightly mist your braids and scalp. The alcohol evaporates quickly. It helps to sanitize and remove surface odors. Avoid over-saturating.
    *   **Dry Shampoo/Braid Spray:** Use a dry shampoo or a specialized braid spray. These products absorb oils and refresh the scent of your hair. Spray lightly and distribute evenly.
    *   **Fabric Softener Spray (Synthetic Only):** Dilute liquid fabric softener with water (1 part softener to 3-4 parts water). Lightly mist over synthetic braids. This can add a fresh scent and reduce static. Always test on a small, hidden section first.
*   **For Removed Braiding Hair (General Odor):**
    *   **Deep Clean with Clarifying Shampoo:** Follow the deep cleaning steps mentioned earlier. Use a clarifying shampoo. This will remove all product buildup, oils, and trapped odors.
    *   **Baking Soda Soak:** After washing, you can give the removed hair another soak. Use a baking soda solution. Add 1/2 cup of baking soda to a basin of water. Soak the hair for 30 minutes. Rinse thoroughly afterward.
    *   **Essential Oils (Optional):** After cleaning and drying, you can add a few drops of a pleasant-smelling essential oil. Mix it with a carrier oil like jojoba or almond oil. Lightly apply it to the hair. Lavender or peppermint oils are good choices.

Always ensure the braiding hair is completely dry after any odor removal treatment. Dampness can lead to new, worse odors and mildew. Proper drying is as important as the cleaning agent itself. These methods help your braiding hair smell fresh and clean.

### Drying and Storing Braiding Hair for Longevity

Cleaning braiding hair is only half the battle. Proper drying and storage are equally important. Incorrect drying can lead to mildew. This creates a terrible smell. It also causes damage. Poor storage can result in tangles. It can also cause kinks or damage the hair's texture. You want your clean braiding hair to remain fresh. You also want it ready for its next use. Following these steps ensures your efforts in cleaning pay off. It also protects your investment.

Here are the best practices for drying and storing braiding hair:

*   **Drying Braiding Hair:**
    *   **Gentle Squeeze:** After rinsing, gently squeeze out as much excess water as possible. Do not twist or wring the hair. This can stretch or damage the fibers. It can also cause tangling.
    *   **Towel Blot:** Lay the braiding hair flat on a clean, absorbent towel. Gently roll the hair in the towel. Press down to blot out more moisture. You can also pat the hair dry. This removes a significant amount of water.
    *   **Air Dry is Best:** The safest and most recommended method is air drying.
        *   **Hang:** Hang the braiding hair. Use a clothes hanger or a dedicated drying rack. Make sure there is good air circulation. You can use clips to secure the hair to the hanger.
        *   **Lay Flat:** Alternatively, lay the hair flat on a clean, dry surface. Use a mesh drying rack. Flip the hair periodically. This ensures even drying.
    *   **Avoid Direct Heat (Especially for Synthetic):** Do not use high heat from a blow dryer on synthetic hair. High heat can melt, frizz, or deform synthetic fibers. If you must use a blow dryer, use the cool or low-heat setting. Keep the dryer moving.
    *   **Ensure Complete Dryness:** This is crucial. Braiding hair must be bone dry before storage. Any lingering moisture can lead to mildew, mold, and a musty smell. This can also damage the hair. Drying can take 24-48 hours. This depends on humidity and hair thickness.
*   **Storing Braiding Hair:**
    *   **Detangle Before Storage:** Once completely dry, gently detangle the hair. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers. Start from the ends and work your way up. This prevents knots when you take the hair out next time.
    *   **Organize by Type/Color:** If you have different types or colors of hair, store them separately. This makes it easier to find what you need later.
    *   **Use Original Packaging or Ziplock Bags:** The best way to store braiding hair is in its original packaging. This often has labels for hair type and length. If you do not have the original packaging, use large, sealable plastic bags (Ziplock bags). These protect the hair from dust and moisture. They also keep it organized.
    *   **Store Flat or Hung:**
        *   **Flat:** Lay hair flat in a bag. Store it in a drawer or box. This works well for shorter lengths.
        *   **Hung:** For longer hair, you can hang it. Loop it over a hanger. Place a plastic bag over the hung hair. This keeps it from tangling. It also preserves its natural drape.
    *   **Cool, Dry Place:** Store the hair in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight or extreme temperature changes. Sunlight can fade hair color. Extreme temperatures can affect synthetic fibers.
    *   **Label Bags:** Label your storage bags. Include the hair type, color, length, and date cleaned. This helps you keep track of your inventory. It also makes future projects easier.

By carefully drying and storing your braiding hair, you extend its lifespan. You also ensure it is always ready for your next creative hairstyle.
