## Keep Your New Balance Suede Shoes Looking New

New Balance suede shoes offer both comfort and style. Their soft, luxurious texture adds a premium feel to any outfit. However, suede is a delicate material. It easily attracts dirt, dust, and stains. Proper care is essential to keep your suede New Balance footwear in top condition. Neglecting suede can lead to permanent damage and dullness.

Cleaning suede shoes requires specific tools and methods. You cannot just throw them in the washing machine like other materials. Special techniques help remove dirt without harming the delicate fibers. This guide explains how to clean New Balance suede shoes effectively. We will cover preparation, cleaning tools, specific steps for dirt and stains, and vital aftercare tips. Follow these instructions to protect your investment and extend the life of your favorite New Balance sneakers. You will keep your shoes looking fresh and new for a long time.

### Takeaway

*   Gather the right tools: a suede brush, eraser, and cleaner.
*   Always dry brush suede shoes first to remove loose dirt.
*   Treat stains gently with a suede eraser or specialized cleaner.
*   Apply a protective spray after cleaning to prevent future damage.

### Answer to the Main Query

To clean New Balance suede shoes, gently brush off loose dirt with a suede brush. Use a suede eraser for scuffs and small marks. For tougher stains, apply a specialized suede cleaner sparingly with a clean cloth, then brush the nap. Always allow the shoes to air dry completely.

## Understanding Suede Material and Its Cleaning Needs

Suede is a unique leather type. It comes from the underside of animal hides. This gives it a soft, napped finish. The fibers are delicate and absorb liquids quickly. This makes suede prone to staining. Regular leather has a smooth, outer surface. Suede has an open, fuzzy texture. This texture traps dirt and dust easily.

You must handle suede with care. Harsh chemicals and excessive water can damage it. Water can cause stains and stiffen the material. It can also change the color. Traditional shoe cleaning methods often do not work for suede. For example, you should never put suede shoes in a washing machine. This can ruin their shape and texture permanently. Special suede brushes and cleaners protect the fibers. They lift dirt without saturating the material. Knowing these properties helps you clean your New Balance suede shoes correctly. Proper understanding ensures your shoes last longer and look better.

## Essential Tools for Cleaning Suede New Balance Shoes

Having the right tools makes a big difference. Using improper items can harm your suede shoes. Gather these specific supplies before you begin cleaning. Each tool serves a distinct purpose.

*   **Suede Brush:** This brush has soft bristles, sometimes with rubber nubs or brass wire. It lifts dirt and restores the nap. Always brush in one direction.
*   **Suede Eraser:** This looks like a pencil eraser. It removes scuffs, marks, and dry stains. You rub it gently over the affected area.
*   **Suede Cleaner (Specialized):** Choose a cleaner specifically for suede and nubuck. These formulas are gentle. They break down dirt without damaging the material. Avoid harsh detergents.
*   **Clean Cloths:** Microfiber cloths work best. They are soft and absorbent. You will need a few for different steps.
*   **Bowl of Water:** A small bowl of clean water is useful for rinsing cloths or diluting cleaners.
*   **Shoe Trees or Paper:** Use these to help maintain the shoe's shape. Stuff them inside before cleaning. This prevents creasing during the process.
*   **Protective Spray:** A suede protector creates a barrier. It repels water and stains. Apply it after cleaning.
*   **Crep Protect Wipes or Similar (Optional):** These wipes are great for quick spot cleaning when you are on the go. They are gentle and effective for minor marks.

Using these specialized tools ensures gentle yet effective cleaning for your New Balance suede. Do not substitute them with general cleaning supplies. General cleaners can cause irreversible damage to the delicate suede fibers.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Suede New Balance Footwear

Cleaning suede requires a gentle, methodical approach. Follow these steps carefully to achieve the best results without damaging your New Balance shoes. This process tackles general dirt and minor scuffs.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Shoes for Cleaning

Preparation is key for any cleaning job. First, remove the shoelaces. This lets you access all areas of the shoe. It also prevents laces from getting dirty or tangled during cleaning. Next, stuff your shoes with shoe trees or crumpled newspaper. This helps them keep their shape during cleaning and drying. It also provides a firm surface for brushing and scrubbing. Do not use colored newspaper as the ink might transfer.

Then, give your shoes a good dry brushing. Use your suede brush. Gently brush the entire suede surface in one direction. This removes loose dirt, dust, and debris. This initial dry brush prevents you from rubbing dirt deeper into the suede during later steps. It also helps lift the nap, preparing it for deeper cleaning. Take your time with this step. It lays the groundwork for effective stain removal.

### Step 2: Removing Dirt and Scuffs with a Suede Brush and Eraser

After dry brushing, focus on specific marks. For scuffs and minor dirt, grab your suede eraser. Gently rub the eraser back and forth over the affected areas. Think of it like erasing pencil marks from paper. The eraser friction lifts dirt particles. It also helps to restore the nap. Do not press too hard. Excessive force can damage the suede fibers.

Once you have erased the marks, use the suede brush again. Brush the treated areas. This removes any eraser residue. It also lifts the nap once more. Brush in a consistent direction to create a uniform look. Repeat this process until scuffs and dry dirt are gone. This method is effective for common, everyday wear and tear. It keeps your New Balance shoes looking tidy.

### Step 3: Tackling Stubborn Stains with Suede Cleaner

Some stains need more than just a brush and eraser. For tougher marks like oil, grease, or mud, use a specialized suede cleaner. Always test the cleaner on an inconspicuous area first. This ensures it does not cause discoloration. Apply a small amount of cleaner to a clean cloth. Do not apply it directly to the shoe.

Gently blot the stain with the dampened cloth. Work from the outside of the stain inwards. This prevents the stain from spreading. Do not rub vigorously. Rubbing can push the stain deeper. Continue blotting until the stain begins to lift. You might need to reapply cleaner to a fresh part of the cloth. After the stain is gone, lightly brush the area with your suede brush. This helps restore the nap and blends the cleaned spot. Ensure the area is not overly saturated. Remember, less is more when using liquid on suede.

For comprehensive cleaning, consider the inside of your shoes too. While suede is delicate on the outside, the inside can accumulate sweat and odor. Learn [how to clean the inside of shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes) for a fully refreshed pair.

### Step 4: Drying Your Suede New Balance Shoes Properly

Proper drying is crucial for suede. Never use direct heat to dry your shoes. This includes hairdryers, radiators, or direct sunlight. High heat can shrink, crack, or stiffen the suede. It can also cause discoloration. Always allow your shoes to air dry naturally.

Place your cleaned New Balance suede shoes in a cool, well-ventilated area. Avoid damp or humid environments. Make sure they are not near any heat sources. Keep the shoe trees or crumpled newspaper inside. They help absorb moisture from the inside. This also maintains the shoe's shape as it dries. Drying can take several hours, or even overnight. Be patient. Suede must be completely dry before you wear or store it. Rushing the drying process can ruin your efforts.

## Aftercare and Protection for Your Suede New Balance Shoes

Cleaning is only part of maintaining your suede New Balance shoes. Proper aftercare and protection extend their life. These steps help prevent future damage and keep your shoes looking great.

### Applying Suede Protector Spray

A good quality suede protector spray is your best defense. This spray creates an invisible barrier. It repels water and prevents stains from soaking into the suede fibers. Before applying, ensure your shoes are completely clean and dry. Shake the spray can well. Hold it about 6-8 inches away from the shoe. Apply an even, light coat over the entire suede surface. Do not saturate the shoes.

Let the first coat dry for about 15-20 minutes. Then, apply a second light coat. Allow the shoes to dry completely for several hours, or even overnight. Always follow the specific instructions on the protector spray can. Reapply the protector every few months, or after every major cleaning. This regular application maintains the protective barrier. It is an easy step that significantly reduces future cleaning efforts. This protection is vital for the longevity of your delicate suede footwear.

### Regular Maintenance and Storage Tips

Consistent care prevents major cleaning emergencies. Brush your New Balance suede shoes regularly with a suede brush. Do this after each wear if possible. This removes surface dust and maintains the nap. It stops dirt from building up. If you notice a fresh scuff, use your suede eraser immediately. Addressing small issues quickly prevents them from becoming bigger problems.

Store your suede shoes in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight. Sunlight can fade suede color over time. Use shoe trees inside them when not wearing them. Shoe trees help maintain the shoe's original shape. They also absorb moisture from the lining. If you do not have shoe trees, stuff them with acid-free tissue paper. Never store suede shoes in plastic bags. Plastic traps moisture. This can lead to mold or mildew growth. Proper storage keeps your shoes fresh and ready to wear. Remember, prevention is better than extensive cleaning.

### What to Avoid When Cleaning Suede

Suede is delicate. Certain cleaning methods can cause irreversible damage. Avoid these practices at all costs to protect your New Balance suede shoes.

First, **never put suede shoes in the washing machine.** The harsh agitation, hot water, and detergents will destroy the suede. It will shrink, stiffen, and lose its soft texture. The color may bleed or fade. While some shoes can be washed, suede is not one of them. For instance, you would clean tennis shoes differently. Consider methods like [how to clean white mesh tennis shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-mesh-tennis-shoes) for other types of footwear, but never for suede.

Second, **do not use harsh chemicals.** Bleach, ammonia, or strong household cleaners are too aggressive for suede. They can strip the color, dry out the material, or leave permanent stains. Stick to products specifically formulated for suede and nubuck.

Third, **avoid excessive water.** While some suede cleaners are liquid-based, they are designed to dry quickly. Saturating suede with water can cause water spots and stiffening. It can also flatten the nap. If your shoes get wet in the rain, let them air dry naturally. Do not try to speed up drying with heat.

Fourth, **do not scrub aggressively.** Suede fibers are delicate. Vigorous scrubbing can damage the nap and leave permanent marks. Use gentle, light strokes when brushing or erasing. Patience is key. Follow these avoidance tips to ensure your suede shoes stay beautiful.

## Common Suede Stains and How to Treat Them

Different stains require specific treatment methods. Knowing how to approach common suede issues helps you act quickly and effectively. Always treat stains as soon as possible.

### Water Stains

Water is a common enemy of suede. If your New Balance suede shoes get caught in the rain, water spots can appear. These marks look darker than the surrounding suede. To treat water stains, lightly dampen the entire affected area with a spray bottle of clean water. Do not soak the shoe. Just make the area evenly moist. Then, gently blot the excess water with a clean cloth. Use a suede brush to lightly brush the area while it is still damp. This helps lift the nap. Stuff the shoes with paper and let them air dry completely. The goal is to make the water stain blend in by wetting the whole section.

### Oil and Grease Stains

Oil and grease stains are tricky on suede. Act fast if you get oil on your shoes. First, blot the stain with a clean, dry cloth. This removes excess oil. Do not rub the stain. Next, sprinkle a generous amount of cornstarch or talcum powder directly onto the stain. These powders absorb oil. Let the powder sit on the stain for several hours, or preferably overnight. The longer it sits, the more oil it absorbs. After waiting, gently brush away the powder with your suede brush. If the stain persists, repeat the process. For stubborn oil, a specialized suede degreaser might be needed. Always test the degreaser in an hidden area first.

### Mud and Dirt Stains

Mud and dirt are common on shoes. For suede, let the mud dry completely. Do not try to wipe wet mud. Wiping wet mud will spread the stain and push it deeper into the fibers. Once the mud is completely dry, gently scrape off the large clumps with a dull knife or spoon. Be careful not to scratch the suede. Then, use your suede brush to brush away the remaining dry dirt. Brush in one direction. For any lingering marks, use a suede eraser to gently rub them out. Finish by brushing the nap. If the stain still remains, a specialized suede cleaner might be necessary. This method works well for most New Balance models.

## When to Seek Professional Suede Cleaning

Sometimes, DIY cleaning is not enough. Certain situations call for professional help. Knowing when to take your New Balance suede shoes to an expert can save them from irreversible damage.

Consider professional cleaning for **deep-set stains**. If you have tried home methods for oil, ink, or dye stains and they persist, a professional cleaner has stronger tools and chemicals. They know how to treat severe discoloration. They can often remove marks that seem impossible to lift.

Another reason is **extensive damage**. If your suede shoes have significant water damage, widespread discoloration, or have lost their texture due to improper cleaning attempts, a professional can often restore them. They have techniques for re-napping and re-dying suede. This can bring your beloved New Balance shoes back to life.

Professionals also handle **delicate or expensive suede**. If your New Balance suede shoes are a limited edition or very costly, you might not want to risk cleaning them yourself. A professional ensures proper care and specialized treatment. They possess the expertise to work with delicate materials without causing further harm. Investing in professional cleaning can prolong the life and appearance of your valuable suede footwear. It is a smart choice for serious issues.

## FAQs About Cleaning New Balance Suede Shoes

Stick to specialized suede cleaners for safety.

### How often should I clean my New Balance suede shoes?

The frequency of cleaning depends on how often you wear your shoes and the conditions they face. For light wear, a quick dry brush after each outing is often enough.

### What if my suede shoes get wet in the rain?

Once dry, brush them with a suede brush to restore the nap.

### Can I use a regular shoe brush on suede?

### How do I prevent water spots on suede?

To prevent water spots, the best method is to apply a high-quality suede protector spray. This spray creates a water-resistant barrier on the surface of the suede. Reapply the protector periodically, especially after cleaning or if the shoes get wet. Avoid wearing your suede shoes in heavy rain or snow.

### Is it possible to dye suede shoes to cover stains?
