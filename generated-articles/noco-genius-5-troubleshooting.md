A solid red error light often means a reverse polarity connection. This happens if you connect the red clamp to the negative terminal and the black clamp to the positive. Your Noco Genius 5 has protection against this. It will not charge in this state.

*   **Solution:** Disconnect the clamps immediately. Reconnect them correctly. Red clamp to positive (+), black clamp to negative (-). The light should clear. If it persists, check for other issues.

### Red Error Light (Flashing)

A flashing red error light usually points to a low voltage battery. The battery might be too discharged for the Genius 5 to detect it. Batteries below a certain voltage (e.g., 2V for 12V batteries) can trigger this.

*   **Solution:** The Genius 5 has a "Force Mode" or "Repair Mode" for deeply discharged batteries. Press and hold the Mode button for 3-5 seconds to enter Force Mode. This overrides low voltage detection. It allows charging of very low batteries. Be careful when using Force Mode. Only use it if you know the battery is safe. It is also important to consider if the battery has a short circuit. If you use a [Noco Genius Gen 3 troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/noco-genius-gen-3-troubleshooting) guide, you might find similar deep discharge recovery options available.

### Green/Orange Flashing Lights

These often indicate a charge progress or analysis phase. It is not an error but a state. The charger is analyzing the battery or bulk charging. Allow time for the process to continue.

*   **Solution:** Patience is key here. If this state persists for a very long time without changing, the battery might be damaged. Or it could be too large for the Genius 5 to charge efficiently.

### No Lights or No Response

If your Noco Genius 5 shows no lights, it might not be receiving power. Or it could be a complete internal failure.

*   **Solution:** Check the AC power outlet. Try plugging another device into the outlet to confirm it works. Inspect the AC cord for damage. Ensure the plug is fully inserted. If still no response, the unit might need professional service. This is a crucial part of Noco Genius 5 troubleshooting. It ensures you address the most basic power supply issues first.

Understanding these visual cues helps you react quickly. Correctly interpreting the lights guides your next troubleshooting steps. For other NOCO devices, like the jump starters, different lights might indicate issues, so understanding the specific model's indicators is always important, as outlined in a [Noco Boost Plus GB40 troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/noco-boost-plus-gb40-troubleshooting) guide.

## Noco Genius 5 Not Charging: Power and Connectivity Issues

One of the most common Noco Genius 5 troubleshooting scenarios is when the charger does not seem to charge the battery. This problem often stems from power supply or connection issues. The Genius 5 needs stable AC power. It also needs a solid connection to the battery. If any of these are weak, charging will not begin or will be interrupted.

### AC Power Supply Problems

Your Noco Genius 5 relies on a good power source. A faulty outlet or extension cord can stop it from working. I always start by checking the power point.
