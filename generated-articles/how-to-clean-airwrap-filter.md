## How To Clean Your Airwrap Filter for Peak Performance

Is your Dyson Airwrap not performing its best? Perhaps it suddenly stops, or the airflow feels weaker. A common cause for these issues is a dirty filter. Learning how to clean Airwrap filter properly is simple, but very important.

A clean filter allows your styling tool to work efficiently. It prevents dust and hair from harming the motor. This article explains why cleaning your Airwrap filter matters. It also gives you a clear, step-by-step guide to do it. You will learn what tools you need and how often to clean. We also cover common problems and tips for long-term care. Keep your Airwrap styling like new with regular filter maintenance.

### Takeaway

*   Regularly clean your Airwrap filter to keep airflow strong.
*   Use the filter cleaning brush provided by the manufacturer.
*   Never rinse the Airwrap filter with water; always dry clean.
*   A clean filter extends your Airwrap's life and maintains styling power.

To effectively clean your Airwrap filter, disconnect the device from power, remove the filter cage, and use the provided cleaning brush to clear trapped hair and dust. Gently brush the mesh until it is clear of debris, then replace the filter cage securely. This simple process prevents motor strain and maintains optimal airflow for peak performance.

## Why Cleaning Your Airwrap Filter Matters So Much

A clean Airwrap filter is crucial for your styling tool's health. Think of the filter as the lungs of your Airwrap. It pulls air in to create powerful airflow. This airflow styles your hair. Over time, hair, dust, and product residue build up on this filter. This buildup blocks air from entering the device.

When the filter is blocked, your Airwrap's motor works harder. It tries to pull enough air through the clogged mesh. This extra effort can cause the motor to overheat. Overheating shortens the life of your device. It also reduces the motor's efficiency. You might notice less powerful airflow or a weaker styling effect. Your curls may not hold as well. Your hair might not dry as quickly. This happens because the air circulation is poor.

Furthermore, a dirty filter can impact hygiene. Hair and dust collect on the filter. These particles can harbor germs or odors. A clean filter ensures clean air blows onto your hair. This makes your styling experience more pleasant and sanitary. Cleaning your Airwrap filter protects your investment. It ensures consistent, high-quality styling results every time you use it. This simple task keeps your Airwrap running smoothly and effectively for years. It protects the sensitive components inside the device from harmful debris. Ignoring this step risks permanent damage.

## When to Clean Your Airwrap Filter for Best Results

Knowing when to clean your Airwrap filter is as important as knowing how. The frequency of cleaning depends on how often you use your device. It also depends on your hair type and styling products. If you use your Airwrap daily, you may need to clean the filter more often. For light users, a monthly clean might be enough. Pay attention to how your Airwrap performs. This often tells you when a cleaning is due.

Your Airwrap has indicator lights that signal a dirty filter. Look for a white LED light flashing. This light is usually located on the handle. When it flashes, it means the airflow is restricted. This is your cue to clean the filter right away. Another sign is reduced airflow. If your Airwrap feels less powerful, or takes longer to dry or style hair, the filter likely needs attention. You might also hear a change in the motor sound. A strained or higher-pitched sound suggests the motor is working harder than it should.

Consider your styling habits. If you use a lot of hairspray, dry shampoo, or other styling products, residue can build up on the filter. These products can make dust and hair stick more easily. This speeds up the clogging process. Even if you don't use it often, dust settles. So, a regular check-up is always a good idea. I personally like to give my filter a quick brush every week or two. It prevents big buildups. This small habit keeps my Airwrap in top condition. Ignoring these signs can lead to motor damage. It can even cause your Airwrap to shut off completely. Regular cleaning prevents these issues.

## Gathering Your Essential Cleaning Tools

Cleaning your Airwrap filter does not require many special tools. In fact, the manufacturer includes the most important item with your device. This is the filter cleaning brush. It looks like a small, cylindrical brush designed to fit perfectly around the filter cage. If you cannot find your original brush, you can often buy a replacement. Some generic brushes designed for small appliance filters may also work.

Here is a simple list of what you will need:

*   **The Filter Cleaning Brush:** This is the primary tool. It has stiff bristles that grab dust and hair. Make sure it is clean before you start.
*   **A Soft, Dry Cloth:** You will use this to wipe down the exterior of the filter cage. It helps remove any surface dust.
*   **A Well-Lit Area:** Good lighting helps you see all the debris on the filter. You do not want to miss any spots.
*   **A Trash Can:** Keep one nearby for easy disposal of the removed dust and hair.

It is important to remember what *not* to use. Never use water to clean the main Airwrap filter. The filter is an electrical component. Water can damage the motor and electronics. Do not use harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners either. These can harm the filter material. Stick to the dry brushing method. This keeps your Airwrap safe and functional. Having these few items ready makes the cleaning process quick and easy. It ensures you clean the filter effectively.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Airwrap Filter

Cleaning your Airwrap filter is a straightforward process. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a thorough and safe clean. My own experience has shown that taking these few minutes makes a huge difference in performance.

### 1. Disconnect from Power

Before you do anything, unplug your Dyson Airwrap from the wall outlet. Safety first. This prevents accidental power-on. It protects you from electric shock. Make sure the device is completely off and cool to the touch.

### 2. Locate and Remove the Filter Cage

The filter is located at the very bottom of the Airwrap handle. It has a removable cage that covers the filter mesh. To remove it, twist the filter cage counter-clockwise. You will hear a click or feel it unlock. Then, pull the cage down and away from the handle. It should slide off easily. Be gentle as you remove it.

### 3. Clear Debris from the Filter Mesh

You will see a fine mesh filter inside the handle once the cage is off. This is where hair and dust collect. Use the provided filter cleaning brush. Slide the brush over the filter mesh. Twist and move the brush up and down. This motion helps dislodge trapped hair and dust. You will see debris coming off the filter. Continue brushing until the mesh looks clear. You might need to tap the brush gently against a trash can to remove buildup from the bristles. Do not push the brush bristles into the mesh too hard. Just use a gentle, sweeping motion.

### 4. Clean the Filter Cage

The removable filter cage itself can also collect dust and hair. Use your filter cleaning brush to clean inside and outside the cage. Brush away any trapped debris. You can also use a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the cage. Make sure it is free of dust before reattaching. Again, avoid using water on the filter cage itself, as it might introduce moisture to the internal components later.

### 5. Reassemble the Filter

Once both the filter mesh and the cage are clean, it's time to put it back together. Slide the clean filter cage back onto the bottom of the Airwrap handle. Align the small arrows or markings on the cage and the handle. Then, twist the cage clockwise until it clicks into place. Make sure it is secure. A loose filter cage can affect performance or fall off during use.

### 6. Test Your Airwrap

Plug your Airwrap back into the power outlet. Turn it on. You should notice an immediate improvement in airflow. The motor should sound smoother. Any flashing indicator lights should now be off. If the light persists or performance is still poor, the filter might need another brush. Or there could be a deeper issue. For general Dyson care, you might find it helpful to look into [how to clean Dyson Air filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dyson-air-filter) or even [how to clean Dyson vacuum filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dyson-vacuum-filter) as these share similar filter cleaning principles with other Dyson devices.

## Troubleshooting Common Filter Issues

Even after cleaning, you might encounter issues with your Airwrap. Sometimes, a simple brush isn't enough. It is good to know what else to check. I have faced some of these myself and found solutions.

### Persistent Flashing Light

If the white LED light continues to flash after cleaning, it means the airflow is still restricted. This might happen for a few reasons. First, you might not have removed all the debris. Re-do the cleaning steps. Pay extra attention to brushing thoroughly. Sometimes, fine dust can remain deep in the mesh. Take your time with the brush. Try turning the brush as you clean to reach all angles of the filter.

### Reduced Airflow Remains

If the airflow does not improve, check the filter cage's reattachment. Make sure it is securely twisted into place. A loose cage can allow air to bypass the filter, which might confuse the sensor. Also, confirm you used the correct cleaning brush. A brush that is too soft or too large won't be effective. Sometimes, the filter itself might be worn out. If the mesh looks damaged or frayed, it might need replacement.

### Strange Noises

A dirty filter often makes the motor work harder, causing new noises. If cleaning does not fix a screeching or whining sound, the issue might be deeper. It could be motor strain or a different internal problem. In such cases, contact Dyson support. Do not try to open the main body of the Airwrap yourself. This can void your warranty.

### Other Debris Blockages

While the filter is the main culprit, sometimes debris can get past it. This is rare but possible. If you clean the filter thoroughly and still have problems, consider if there is anything else blocking air. This can include hair stuck in the attachments themselves. Learn [how to clean Dyson Airwrap attachments](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dyson-airwrap-attachments) for a complete cleaning routine. A fully cleaned device performs best. For serious problems, Dyson offers repair services. They have specialized tools to diagnose and fix internal issues. Regular cleaning helps avoid these bigger problems.

## Maintaining Your Airwrap's Filter Health for Longevity

Regular maintenance of your Airwrap filter goes beyond just cleaning it when it flashes. Proactive steps help extend the life of your device. They ensure you always get the best styling results. I have found these simple habits make a real difference in how long my Airwrap lasts.

### Implement a Routine Cleaning Schedule

Do not wait for the warning light. Create a cleaning schedule based on your usage. If you use your Airwrap daily, a quick brush-off every week is wise. If you use it a few times a week, clean it bi-weekly or monthly. Mark it on your calendar. This prevents significant debris buildup. Consistent, light cleaning is better than infrequent, heavy cleaning. It keeps the filter from becoming heavily clogged.

### Brush Off After Each Use (Quick Sweep)

After each styling session, take a minute to lightly brush the outside of the filter cage. This helps remove loose hairs and dust before they get pulled into the filter. You do not need to remove the cage for this quick sweep. Just a few passes with the brush can prevent immediate buildup. This is a very simple habit to adopt.

### Keep Your Styling Area Clean

Dust and hair in your styling area will inevitably get pulled into your Airwrap. Try to keep your counter and floors clean. Regularly wipe down surfaces. Sweep or vacuum up loose hair. This reduces the amount of debris available to clog your filter. A clean environment means a cleaner Airwrap.

### Avoid Using Styling Products Directly Near the Filter

Some styling products can leave sticky residue. If you spray hairspray or dry shampoo near the Airwrap's filter intake, the residue can make dust stick more effectively. Try to apply products before styling. Or, apply them away from the Airwrap's base. This minimizes product buildup on the filter mesh.

### Store Your Airwrap Properly

When not in use, store your Airwrap in a clean, dust-free place. The original case is excellent for this. If you do not use the case, keep it in a drawer or a cabinet. Avoid leaving it out where dust and pet hair can easily accumulate on the filter. Proper storage protects the filter and the entire device. These small steps ensure your Airwrap stays in top condition. They also save you time and money on repairs or replacements. It is about protecting your investment.

## Extending Your Airwrap's Lifespan Beyond the Filter

While filter cleaning is vital, other aspects of care also contribute to your Airwrap's longevity. A holistic approach ensures your device functions perfectly for years. I treat my Airwrap with care beyond just the filter, and it has paid off.

### Clean Your Airwrap Attachments Regularly

Your Airwrap comes with various styling attachments. These include curling barrels and brushes. Hair product residue, oils, and general grime can build up on them. This buildup affects styling performance. It can also transfer to your hair. Clean your attachments after several uses. You can often wipe them with a damp cloth and mild soap. Let them dry completely before reattaching. Keeping them clean ensures consistent heat and airflow through the styling parts. You can find detailed guides on [how to clean Dyson Airwrap attachments](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dyson-airwrap-attachments) for specific advice.

### Store Attachments Properly

Just like the main unit, attachments benefit from proper storage. Use the storage case that came with your Airwrap. This protects them from dust and damage. It also prevents them from getting scratched or bent. Loose attachments can get damaged, affecting their fit and performance.

### Handle with Care

The Dyson Airwrap is a premium device. It is designed well but still needs careful handling. Avoid dropping it. Dropping can damage internal components or crack the casing. Always pick it up by the handle, not by the cord or an attachment. When unplugging, pull the plug, not the cord. Stress on the cord near the device can damage internal wires over time.

### Avoid Overuse in One Session

While the Airwrap is powerful, even advanced motors can get hot. Give your device short breaks if you are styling for an extended period. This allows the motor to cool down. It prevents unnecessary strain. If you are doing a full head of hair, divide it into sections and pause for a minute or two between sections. This small break can prevent overheating.

### Keep Cords Untangled and Undamaged

The power cord is crucial for your Airwrap's function. Ensure it does not get tangled or kinked. Store it neatly. A damaged cord can be a safety hazard. It can also cause intermittent power issues. Check the cord regularly for any signs of wear. If you notice any damage, do not use the device. Get it inspected by a professional. By following these extra steps, you protect your entire Airwrap system. You ensure it remains a reliable tool for your hair styling needs.
