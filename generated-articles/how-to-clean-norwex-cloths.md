## How To Clean Norwex Cloths

Norwex cloths are special cleaning tools. They clean surfaces with just water. Many people use them to reduce chemical use in their homes. To keep these cloths working well, you must clean them correctly. Improper care can ruin their unique fibers. It can also make them less effective at picking up dirt and grime. I will explain the best ways to care for your Norwex cloths. This guide will cover daily rinsing, machine washing, deep cleaning, and proper drying methods. By following these steps, your Norwex cloths will stay fresh and ready for many cleaning tasks. You will also extend their life and maintain their high performance.

### Takeaway

To ensure your Norwex cloths remain effective and last long, remember these key points:
*   Rinse cloths immediately after use to remove loose dirt.
*   Wash Norwex cloths separately or with lint-free items.
*   Always use cold or warm water, never hot, for washing.
*   Choose a free and clear detergent; avoid fabric softeners and bleach.
*   Air dry or machine dry on low heat to protect the fibers.
*   Deep clean occasionally to remove built-up residue and odors.

Norwex cloths need specific care. To clean Norwex cloths, rinse them well after each use. Machine wash them with a free and clear detergent in cold or warm water. Avoid fabric softener, bleach, and high heat drying. This helps maintain their special microfiber and BacLock properties.

### Understand Your Norwex Cloths: The Basics of Microfiber Care

Norwex cloths are not ordinary rags. They use special microfiber technology. Each cloth has millions of tiny fibers. These fibers grab and hold dirt, dust, and grime. They do this very well, even without harsh chemicals. Many Norwex cloths also include BacLock. BacLock is a silver agent embedded in the cloth. It helps to self-purify the cloth. This means it slows the growth of odor-causing bacteria within the cloth. This makes the cloths stay fresh longer.

Traditional cleaning products can harm Norwex cloths. Fabric softener is a big no-no. It coats the microfiber bristles. This stops the cloth from picking up dirt. Bleach can also damage the fibers. It can break them down and reduce their effectiveness. Harsh chemicals reduce the cloth's lifespan. They can also affect the BacLock feature. Understanding these basic principles helps you care for your cloths properly. My goal is to keep your cloths working at their best.

Proper care starts with understanding the material. Microfiber needs specific treatment to perform its best. The tiny fibers must remain open to trap particles. If they get clogged, the cloth becomes less effective. This is why avoiding certain products is so important. When you use your Norwex cloth, you are relying on these small fibers. Keeping them clean and open ensures they do their job well.

Think of your Norwex cloth like a high-performance tool. You would not use the wrong fuel in a special car. The same idea applies here. Giving your Norwex cloth the right care means it will keep cleaning for years. It saves you money and helps the environment. This basic knowledge sets the stage for all cleaning methods.

### Daily Care: Rinsing and Drying Norwex Cloths

Proper daily care extends the life of your Norwex cloths. After each use, you should rinse your cloth thoroughly. This step is very important. It removes loose dirt, dust, and debris that the cloth picked up. Holding the cloth under running water works well. Squeeze the cloth repeatedly while rinsing. This forces out trapped particles. You will see the water change color as dirt leaves the cloth.

I always rinse my cloths right after cleaning. This prevents dirt from drying into the fibers. It keeps the cloth cleaner for its next use. It also helps to prevent odors from developing. A good rinse makes machine washing less often necessary. It also means you use less water and energy over time.

After rinsing, you must dry the cloth properly. Air drying is the best method for Norwex cloths. Hang the cloth to dry in a well-ventilated area. Make sure it has plenty of airflow. This allows the BacLock feature to work. The silver agent needs air exposure to inhibit bacterial growth. It also helps the cloth dry fast.

Avoid wadding up the cloth. Do not leave it in a damp pile. This can cause mold or mildew to grow. It will also make the cloth smell bad. You can hang it on a hook. You can also drape it over a towel rack. Some people use a special drying rack. I find that simply hanging it over the side of my laundry basket works well. This quick daily care makes a big difference. It keeps your cloths fresh and ready. Drying items thoroughly after they get wet is crucial for many cleaning tools. For instance, knowing [how to clean water shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-water-shoes) also highlights the importance of proper drying to prevent issues.

Storing your Norwex cloths correctly matters too. Once dry, store them unfolded. Keep them in a clean, dry place. This prevents them from absorbing smells. It also keeps them from becoming dusty. Proper daily care ensures your cloths stay effective and last longer.

### Machine Washing Norwex Cloths for Best Results

Machine washing your Norwex cloths is easy if you follow specific steps. First, prepare your cloths. Shake off any loose debris. Rinse very dirty cloths under running water before putting them in the machine. This removes large particles. It also prevents them from transferring to other items in the wash. I sometimes do a quick hand rinse if a cloth is extra soiled.

Next, load your washing machine. Wash Norwex cloths separately from other laundry. If you must wash them with other items, choose lint-free fabrics. Towels or cotton items can shed lint. This lint can get stuck in the Norwex microfiber. This makes the cloths less effective. It also makes them look messy. I find a dedicated Norwex load works best.

Choose the right wash cycle. Use cold or warm water. Never use hot water. Hot water can damage the microfiber. It can cause the fibers to break down. This reduces the cloth's absorbency and cleaning power. A gentle cycle is usually enough. For a thorough clean, a regular cycle on a cold setting is good.

Detergent choice is very important. Use a free and clear liquid detergent. Look for one with no dyes or perfumes. Norwex sells its own Ultra Power Plus Laundry Detergent. This detergent works well for Norwex cloths. Avoid powdered detergents. They can leave residue in the fibers. Absolutely do not use fabric softener. It coats the fibers. This makes them unable to pick up dirt. Avoid bleach at all costs. Bleach harms the BacLock silver in the cloth. It also degrades the microfiber itself. Using the correct detergent protects your investment.

Proper washing ensures the cloths remain highly absorbent. It also helps them keep their powerful cleaning action. When done correctly, machine washing helps to restore your cloths. They will feel soft and ready to tackle any cleaning job. Remember, the goal is to keep the fibers open and active.

### Deep Cleaning Norwex Cloths: Restoring Absorbency and Freshness

Sometimes, daily rinsing and machine washing are not enough. Your Norwex cloths might lose their absorbency. They might develop a lingering odor. This happens due to product buildup or trapped grime. When your cloth feels less effective, it is time for a deep clean. This process restores the cloth's performance. It also makes it feel fresh again.

One popular deep cleaning method is boiling. First, fill a large pot with water. Bring the water to a rolling boil. Carefully add your Norwex cloths. Let them boil for 10-15 minutes. The hot water helps to release trapped dirt. It also helps to open up the microfiber fibers. You might see a layer of residue float to the surface. This is the buildup leaving the cloth. After boiling, carefully remove the cloths. Let them cool. Then, rinse them thoroughly under cold water. Finally, machine wash them as usual. This method truly revives the cloths.

Another effective deep cleaning method is soaking. You can use white vinegar for this. Vinegar is a natural cleaner. It helps to break down mineral deposits and odors. Mix one part white vinegar with three parts warm water in a basin. Submerge your Norwex cloths in the solution. Let them soak for several hours, or even overnight. The vinegar works to lift away stubborn residue. It also neutralizes odors. After soaking, rinse the cloths very well. Then, machine wash them. Vinegar is a versatile cleaning agent. It is great for removing grime, just like when you need to [clean a shower with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shower-with-vinegar). Its acidic nature helps dissolve soap scum and hard water stains effectively. Similarly, when you want to make glass sparkling, knowing [how to clean glass with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-glass-with-vinegar) proves its power.

For very stubborn odors or slight mildew, vinegar is also a strong solution. If I notice a persistent smell, I often turn to a vinegar soak. This helps to eliminate the source of the odor. It also helps restore the cloth's natural freshness. Remember to rinse thoroughly after any deep cleaning. This removes all traces of the cleaning agent. Deep cleaning brings your cloths back to life. It ensures they continue to perform their best. This helps you get the most value from your Norwex investment.

### Tackling Tough Stains and Odors on Norwex Cloths

Even with proper care, your Norwex cloths might sometimes get tough stains or persistent odors. These issues need extra attention. Stains from grease, food, or other substances can cling to the microfiber. Odors can develop from bacteria or improper drying. Addressing these problems quickly helps keep your cloths in top shape.

For stains, avoid using harsh stain removers. These can damage the microfiber. Instead, try a pre-treatment with a gentle laundry soap. Apply a small amount of liquid detergent directly to the stain. Gently rub it in with your fingers. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes. Then, machine wash the cloth as usual. You can also try making a paste with the Norwex Ultra Power Plus Laundry Detergent and a little water. Apply the paste to the stain and let it work. This method often lifts tough stains without harming the cloth.

Persistent odors often come from bacteria or buildup. The BacLock feature helps, but it does not eliminate all bacteria, especially if the cloth is not properly dried. A deep clean with vinegar is very effective for odors. As I mentioned before, soaking your cloth in a vinegar and water solution can neutralize smells. After soaking, rinse the cloth well and machine wash it. This process removes the odor-causing agents. If the cloth smells like mildew, this step is especially important. Mold and mildew can be stubborn. Knowing [how to clean mold with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-with-vinegar) can be very helpful for various household issues, including those on fabrics. Similarly, if you encounter mold in damp areas, understanding [how to clean mold in shower](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-in-shower) shares principles of using strong cleaning agents to combat such issues.

Sometimes, odors are from cleaning certain strong-smelling substances. For example, cleaning up a fish spill might leave a lingering scent. In such cases, repeating the deep cleaning process might be necessary. You can also try adding a small amount of baking soda to your wash cycle. Baking soda is a natural deodorizer. It helps to absorb and neutralize odors. Just sprinkle about a quarter cup into your washing machine drum with your cloths.

The key is to act quickly when you notice a stain or odor. Do not let it set in. Regular deep cleaning also helps prevent these issues. By taking these steps, your Norwex cloths will stay fresh and pleasant to use. This ensures they continue to be a healthy cleaning solution for your home.

### Drying Your Norwex Cloths: Air Drying vs. Machine Drying

Proper drying is crucial for your Norwex cloths. It protects the microfiber and ensures the BacLock feature works well. The best method is air drying. Air drying helps the BacLock self-purify the cloth. It also keeps the fibers intact. Hang your Norwex cloths to air dry. Choose a spot with good air circulation. A drying rack, a clothesline, or even a hook on the back of a door works fine. Make sure the cloth is spread out. Avoid wadding it up. This allows air to flow around all sides. It helps the cloth dry quickly and thoroughly. I always air dry my cloths whenever possible. This simple step extends their life greatly.

If you must machine dry, use the lowest heat setting. High heat is the enemy of microfiber. It can melt or damage the tiny fibers. This makes the cloth lose its ability to pick up dirt. It also reduces its absorbency. Use the "air fluff" or "no heat" setting if your dryer has one. This is the safest option. If you do not have these settings, use the lowest heat possible. Remove the cloths as soon as they are dry. Do not over-dry them.

Never use dryer sheets with Norwex cloths. Dryer sheets contain chemicals and softeners. These can coat the microfiber. This clogs the fibers. It makes the cloth less effective at cleaning. The coating is difficult to remove. It can also reduce the cloth's absorbency. Avoid washing Norwex cloths with items that produce a lot of lint. Lint from cotton towels can stick to the Norwex microfiber. This also clogs the fibers and makes the cloth less efficient. Wash them separately or with other lint-free items.

Proper drying maintains the integrity of the fibers. It ensures your cloths remain soft and highly absorbent. It also helps prevent odors. When a cloth stays damp, it creates a breeding ground for bacteria. This can lead to unpleasant smells. A well-dried cloth performs better and lasts longer. Taking care in the drying process pays off. It keeps your valuable Norwex cloths ready for your next cleaning task.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Norwex Cloths

Cleaning Norwex cloths is simple, but certain mistakes can damage them. Avoiding these common errors ensures your cloths last for many years. It also keeps them performing their best. I have learned these lessons over time. Sharing them helps you avoid costly errors.

First, never use bleach. Bleach is very harsh. It breaks down the delicate microfiber. It also degrades the BacLock silver in the cloth. This reduces the cloth's ability to self-purify. Bleach will ruin your Norwex cloth quickly. Stick to gentle, bleach-free detergents.

Second, avoid fabric softener at all costs. This is perhaps the most common mistake. Fabric softener leaves a waxy coating on the microfiber. This coating clogs the tiny fibers. It makes the cloth unable to absorb water or pick up dirt effectively. Once a cloth is coated with fabric softener, it is very hard to restore. It loses its special cleaning power.

Third, do not use high heat when washing or drying. Hot water and high dryer heat can melt the microfiber. This fuses the tiny fibers together. The cloth becomes less effective. It loses its softness and absorbency. Always use cold or warm water for washing. Air dry or use the lowest heat setting on your dryer. This protects the fiber structure.

Fourth, do not wash Norwex cloths with linty items. Cotton towels, fleece blankets, or certain clothing items shed lint. This lint sticks to the microfiber. It clogs the cloth's pores. This makes the cloth less efficient at cleaning. Wash Norwex cloths separately or with other lint-free materials. This keeps their fibers clear and open.

Fifth, avoid using harsh cleaning chemicals on the cloths. While Norwex cloths are designed to clean with just water, some people might be tempted to use sprays or disinfectants on them. These chemicals can degrade the fibers over time. They can also leave residues that hinder performance. If you need a disinfectant, use it directly on the surface, then wipe with a clean, damp Norwex cloth.

By avoiding these common mistakes, you protect your investment. Your Norwex cloths will remain effective and durable. Proper care means they continue to provide a powerful, chemical-free cleaning solution for your home. This helps you maintain a clean living space with less effort and fewer products.

### FAQ Section

#### Q1: Can I use regular laundry detergent on Norwex?

It is best to use a free and clear liquid laundry detergent. Avoid detergents with dyes, perfumes, or harsh chemicals. Norwex has its own specific detergent, Ultra Power Plus, which works well. Regular detergents, especially powders, can leave residues that clog the microfiber. This reduces the cloth's effectiveness over time.

#### Q2: Why does my Norwex cloth smell?

A Norwex cloth usually smells due to trapped dirt, grease, or improper drying. The BacLock feature helps, but it does not eliminate all odor-causing bacteria if the cloth stays damp.

Yes, you can machine dry Norwex cloths. However, you must use the lowest heat setting or the "air fluff" (no heat) option. High heat can damage the microfiber and reduce the cloth's effectiveness. Air drying is always the preferred method as it is gentlest on the fibers and supports the BacLock feature.

#### Q5: What is the BacLock feature?

BacLock is an exclusive Norwex feature. It is a micro-silver agent embedded in the cloth's fibers. This silver agent helps to self-purify the cloth. It inhibits the growth of odor-causing bacteria, mold, and mildew within the cloth. This keeps the cloth fresher for longer between washes.

#### Q6: How long do Norwex cloths last with proper care?
