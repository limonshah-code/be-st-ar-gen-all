Sometimes, your dog leans on you simply to get your attention. Dogs are intelligent creatures. They learn quickly what gets a response from their owners. If leaning usually results in petting, talking, or cuddling, your dog will repeat the behavior. It is a learned behavior.

Your dog might lean and then look back at you. This is a clear signal. He wants you to notice him. He might be bored or lonely. He might want to play. This leaning is his polite way of asking for interaction. He seeks your eye contact and touch.
