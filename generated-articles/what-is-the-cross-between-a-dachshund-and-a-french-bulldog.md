### What Is The Cross Between A Dachshund And A French Bulldog?

The cross between a Dachshund and a French Bulldog is a hybrid or designer dog. It does not have a formal breed name recognized by major kennel clubs. People commonly refer to this mix as a Doxie Frenchie or a French Bullweenie. It combines genetic traits from both the long-bodied Dachshund and the compact French Bulldog.

## Understanding the Dachshund French Bulldog Mix

Designer dogs are intentionally bred mixes of two purebred dog breeds. The goal is often to combine desired traits from both parents. For the Dachshund French Bulldog mix, breeders aim for a unique companion. This combination brings together the distinctive looks of the Dachshund with the charming personality of the French Bulldog.

This cross is not a purebred dog. It does not follow strict breed standards like its parent breeds. Each puppy in a litter can inherit different traits. This means no two Dachshund French Bulldog mixes will look exactly alike. They will have a blend of characteristics from both the Dachshund and the French Bulldog.

### The Parent Breeds: Dachshund and French Bulldog

Understanding the parent breeds helps us predict the mix's traits. Both Dachshunds and French Bulldogs have distinct histories and characteristics. Knowing them gives us insight into the hybrid's potential.

#### The Dachshund

Dachshunds are famous for their long bodies and short legs. They originated in Germany. Their name means "badger dog," reflecting their original purpose. They hunted badgers and other burrowing animals. Dachshunds come in three coat types: smooth, longhaired, and wirehaired. They also have different sizes: standard and miniature.

Dachshunds are known for being brave, tenacious, and intelligent. They can also be quite stubborn and independent. They have a strong prey drive. My own experience with Dachshunds shows me they are very loyal companions. They form strong bonds with their families.

#### The French Bulldog

French Bulldogs are small, muscular dogs. They are famous for their "bat ears" and compact bodies. Frenchies originated in England. They were miniature Bulldogs. Lace workers took them to France, where they became very popular. They are primarily companion dogs.

French Bulldogs are affectionate, playful, and charming. They are known for being good-natured and loving. They adapt well to apartment living. However, their brachycephalic (flat) faces can lead to breathing problems. I have seen French Bulldogs struggling in hot weather. They are wonderful family pets, but they need careful monitoring in certain conditions.

## Physical Characteristics: What Does a Doxie Frenchie Look Like?

The physical appearance of a Dachshund French Bulldog mix can vary greatly. This is because they inherit a mix of genes from two distinct breeds. Predicting their exact look is challenging, even within the same litter. You might see more Dachshund traits in one puppy and more French Bulldog traits in another.

Breeders aim for a dog that combines the best of both worlds. However, genetics are complex. The result is always unique. I find it exciting to see how these puppies turn out. They often surprise you with their blend of features.

### Size and Weight of the Hybrid

The Doxie Frenchie is a small to medium-sized dog. Its size depends on the size of the Dachshund parent (standard or miniature). A miniature Dachshund parent will result in a smaller mix. A standard Dachshund parent will produce a larger mix.

Most Dachshund French Bulldog mixes weigh between 15 to 30 pounds. Their height typically ranges from 8 to 12 inches at the shoulder. This makes them a comfortable size for most living situations. They are small enough for apartments but sturdy enough for active families.

### Body Shape and Structure

The body shape of a Dachshund French Bulldog cross is one of its most variable features. They might inherit the long, low body of a Dachshund. Or, they could have the more compact, sturdy build of a French Bulldog. Some mixes show a blend, appearing somewhat longer than a Frenchie but not as elongated as a Dachshund.

Their legs also vary in length. They can be short like a Dachshund's or slightly longer, more like a Frenchie's. Their overall structure influences their movement and potential health predispositions. A shorter back might reduce the risk of IVDD, common in Dachshunds. A more compact body might retain some French Bulldog characteristics.

### Coat Type and Color

The coat of a Doxie Frenchie is usually short and smooth. This is because both parent breeds typically have short coats. However, if a longhaired or wirehaired Dachshund is a parent, the mix could have a longer or wirier coat. This is less common, but possible.

The color possibilities are wide. French Bulldogs come in fawn, brindle, cream, and pied. Dachshunds come in black, tan, red, chocolate, and various patterns like dapple or piebald. This means a Dachshund French Bulldog mix can display any combination of these colors and patterns. You might see a black and tan dog with brindle markings. Or, a solid fawn dog with Dachshund-like ears.

### Head, Ears, and Tail

The head shape usually leans towards one parent or the other. Some mixes have the more rounded head of a French Bulldog. Others show the more elongated muzzle of a Dachshund. Their ears are a fun surprise. They can be upright "bat ears" from the Frenchie. Or, they might be floppy like a Dachshund's. Some even have one of each.

Their tail can also vary. French Bulldogs have a naturally short, corkscrew, or straight tail. Dachshunds have a longer, tapering tail. A Doxie Frenchie might have a short stubby tail. Or, they could have a longer tail that wags happily. My own observations show these variations make each dog truly unique.

## Temperament and Personality of the Frenchie Doxie

The temperament of a Frenchie Doxie is a fascinating blend of its parent breeds. Both Dachshunds and French Bulldogs have distinct personalities. The mix can inherit any combination of these traits. Generally, you can expect a dog that is affectionate, playful, and full of character.

These dogs are usually very loyal to their families. They enjoy being close to their people. I often see them trying to be lap dogs, even if they are a bit too big for it. Their personality makes them wonderful companions for many households. However, they also possess a stubborn streak. This trait comes from both parents.

### Personality Blend: Affectionate, Playful, and Sometimes Stubborn

The Frenchie Doxie often shows the best of both worlds. They have the loving and charming nature of the French Bulldog. They also have the spirited and curious demeanor of the Dachshund. They enjoy playtime and love to entertain their owners. This mix can be quite comical with their antics.

Their affectionate side means they thrive on human companionship. They do not like being left alone for long periods. They can develop separation anxiety if they feel neglected. The stubbornness can appear during training. They know what they want and sometimes resist commands. Patience and consistency are important for these dogs.

### Socialization Importance

Early and consistent socialization is crucial for a Frenchie Doxie. Expose them to different people, places, sounds, and other dogs from a young age. This helps them grow into well-adjusted adults. A poorly socialized Doxie Frenchie might become shy or fearful. They might also develop aggressive tendencies.

My advice is to enroll them in puppy classes. Arrange playdates with friendly, vaccinated dogs. Take them to dog-friendly parks and stores. Positive experiences during their formative months shape their behavior. This helps them become confident and friendly companions.

### Compatibility with Families, Children, and Other Pets

The Dachshund French Bulldog mix generally does well with families. They can be good with children, especially if raised with them. However, supervise interactions with very young children. Their small size makes them vulnerable to accidental rough play. Children must learn to interact gently with dogs.

They can coexist with other pets. This is especially true if introduced properly and early. Their prey drive from the Dachshund side might make them chase smaller animals. This includes cats or hamsters. A slow and controlled introduction is always best. Ensure all pets feel safe and comfortable in their presence.

### Energy Levels and Exercise Needs

The energy level of a Frenchie Doxie is moderate. They are not as high-energy as some working breeds. They are not complete couch potatoes either. They enjoy daily walks and playtime. These activities help them stay physically fit and mentally stimulated.

About 30-60 minutes of daily exercise is usually sufficient. This can include walks, fetch in the yard, or indoor games. Avoid strenuous activities, especially in hot weather. French Bulldogs can struggle with heat due to their brachycephalic nature. This trait can pass to the mix. Monitor their breathing during exercise.

### Intelligence and Trainability

Dachshund French Bulldog mixes are intelligent dogs. They can learn commands and tricks quickly. However, their intelligence is often paired with a stubborn streak. This can make training a bit challenging. They might try to outsmart you or simply refuse to cooperate.

Consistency is key when training a Doxie Frenchie. Use positive reinforcement methods. Reward good behavior with treats, praise, and toys. Avoid harsh corrections. These can make them shut down or become fearful. Short, fun training sessions work best. Keep them engaged and motivated.

### Barking Tendencies

Both parent breeds can be vocal. Dachshunds are known for their loud barks. They use them to alert their owners to anything unusual. French Bulldogs can also be quite vocal, using barks, yips, and grunts to communicate. Therefore, a Dachshund French Bulldog mix can inherit these barking tendencies.

Early training can help manage excessive barking. Teach them a "quiet" command. Identify the triggers for their barking. Address those triggers directly. Providing plenty of mental and physical stimulation can also reduce boredom barking. My experience teaches me that a tired dog is often a quiet dog.

## Health Considerations for the Dachshund French Bulldog Hybrid

Like all dog breeds, the Dachshund French Bulldog hybrid can inherit health conditions from its parent breeds. Both Dachshunds and French Bulldogs have specific predispositions. A mixed-breed dog might be less prone to certain purebred diseases due to "hybrid vigor." However, they can still inherit any condition common to either parent.

It is important for potential owners to understand these risks. Responsible breeding practices reduce the chances of inheriting serious conditions. Always ask breeders for health clearances of the parent dogs. Regular veterinary check-ups are also crucial for early detection and management of health issues.

### Inherited Health Issues from Dachshunds

Dachshunds are well-known for their unique spinal structure. This makes them prone to certain conditions.

*   **Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD):** This is a very common and serious condition in Dachshunds. Their long backs can lead to disc herniation or rupture. This causes pain, nerve damage, and sometimes paralysis. If your Doxie Frenchie inherits a longer back, they may be at risk. Preventative measures include maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding jumping.
*   **Patellar Luxation:** This condition involves the kneecap slipping out of place. It can cause lameness and pain. It is more common in smaller breeds.
*   **Eye Conditions:** Dachshunds can be prone to progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and glaucoma. Regular eye exams can help.

### Inherited Health Issues from French Bulldogs

French Bulldogs face specific health challenges due to their brachycephalic (flat-faced) nature.

*   **Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS):** This is a set of conditions that affect breathing. It includes narrowed nostrils, an elongated soft palate, and everted laryngeal saccules. French Bulldogs often snore, snort, and have difficulty breathing, especially in heat or during exercise. A Doxie Frenchie can inherit these respiratory challenges. It is vital to recognize the signs. Learn [how do I know if my French Bulldog has a breathing problem](https://beacleaner.com/how-do-i-know-if-my-french-bulldog-has-a-breathing-problem).
*   **Hip Dysplasia:** This is a genetic condition where the hip joint does not form properly. It leads to arthritis and pain. While more common in larger breeds, it can affect French Bulldogs.
*   **Allergies:** French Bulldogs are prone to skin allergies, food sensitivities, and environmental allergies. These can cause itching, skin infections, and digestive issues.
*   **Cherry Eye:** This condition affects the third eyelid gland. It protrudes and looks like a red mass in the corner of the eye. It is unsightly and can cause discomfort. There are treatments available. Understand [how do you get rid of cherry eye on French Bulldogs](https://beacleaner.com/how-do-you-get-rid-of-cherry-eye-on-french-bulldogs).

### Hybrid Vigor and Overall Health

Hybrid vigor suggests that mixed-breed dogs may have fewer inherited health issues than purebreds. This is because they have a more diverse gene pool. They are less likely to inherit two copies of a recessive gene for a specific disease. However, this is not a guarantee. A Dachshund French Bulldog mix can still inherit health problems from either parent.

Responsible breeders carefully screen parent dogs for genetic conditions. This reduces the risk for puppies. Potential owners must also provide excellent veterinary care throughout the dog's life. Regular check-ups, a healthy diet, and appropriate exercise are vital. These steps help ensure a long and healthy life for your Doxie Frenchie.

## Training and Socializing Your Dachshund French Bulldog Mix

Training and socialization are critical for any dog. They are especially important for a Dachshund French Bulldog mix. These dogs inherit intelligence but also a stubborn streak from both parents. Early and consistent efforts ensure a well-behaved and happy companion. I always tell new puppy owners to start training on day one.

Positive reinforcement methods work best with this mix. They respond well to rewards and praise. Harsh corrections can make them fearful or resistant. Keep training sessions short, fun, and engaging. This helps maintain their attention and enthusiasm.

### Early Training is Key

Start training your Doxie Frenchie puppy as soon as you bring them home. This includes house training, leash training, and basic obedience commands. Puppies are like sponges; they absorb information quickly at a young age. Establishing good habits early prevents bigger problems later.

Focus on foundational commands. "Sit," "stay," "come," and "leave it" are essential. Practice these commands in different environments. This helps your dog generalize their learning. Consistency from all family members is crucial for success. Everyone should use the same commands and reward system.

### Positive Reinforcement Methods

Positive reinforcement builds a strong bond between you and your dog. It makes training a positive experience for both of you. Use treats, verbal praise, and favorite toys as rewards. When your dog performs a desired action, immediately give them a reward. This reinforces the behavior.

Avoid punishment or yelling. These methods can create fear and anxiety. They do not teach your dog what you want them to do. Instead, they can damage your relationship. A positive approach makes training enjoyable and effective for your Doxie Frenchie.

### House Training and Obedience Commands

House training requires patience and consistency. Establish a regular potty schedule. Take your puppy outside frequently, especially after waking up and eating. Reward them immediately when they eliminate outside. Crate training can be a valuable tool for house training. It provides a safe den for your dog.

Obedience commands like "sit" and "stay" are foundational. They help manage your dog's behavior in various situations. Practice these commands daily. Gradually increase the duration and distractions. Make training a part of your daily routine.

### Leash Training Your Frenchie Doxie

Leash training is vital for safety and enjoyment. Start early with a comfortable collar or harness. Introduce the leash gradually. Let your puppy wear it for short periods inside the house. Reward them for calm behavior. Then, start short walks in a quiet area.

French Bulldogs can sometimes be strong pullers, and this trait might pass to your mix. Teach your Doxie Frenchie to walk politely on a leash without pulling. Use treats to lure them into the correct position. Stop walking if they pull, and only continue when the leash is slack. If your French Bulldog tends to pull, you can learn [how do I stop my French Bulldog from pulling on lead](https://beacleaner.com/how-do-i-stop-my-french-bulldog-from-pulling-on-lead). This information can be useful for your mixed breed too.

### Socialization with People, Other Dogs, and Environments

Socialization goes beyond just meeting other dogs. It means exposing your Doxie Frenchie to many different experiences. Introduce them to various people of all ages and appearances. Let them hear different sounds, like traffic or vacuums. Take them to new places, such as parks, pet stores, or friends' houses.

Positive socialization during puppyhood helps prevent fear and aggression. It builds confidence. A well-socialized dog is more adaptable and less stressed in new situations. This makes them a joy to live with.

### Dealing with Stubbornness

Both Dachshunds and French Bulldogs have a reputation for being stubborn. Your Doxie Frenchie might inherit this trait. They may resist commands if they do not see the point. They might test your boundaries. This requires extra patience and creativity from you.

Keep training sessions short and fun. End on a positive note. Use high-value treats to motivate them. Make training feel like a game. Consistency is paramount. Do not give in to their stubbornness. If you stay firm but kind, they will eventually learn that you mean what you say.

## Grooming and Care for the Dachshund French Bulldog Cross

Proper grooming and care are essential for the health and well-being of your Dachshund French Bulldog mix. While their needs are generally moderate, understanding them helps keep your dog happy and healthy. Their specific care needs will depend on which parent's traits they predominantly inherit.

I always emphasize that consistent routine care prevents many common issues. This includes everything from coat maintenance to dental hygiene. Being proactive in your pet's care ensures a long and comfortable life together.

### Coat Care: Brushing and Bathing

The Doxie Frenchie usually has a short, smooth coat. This makes grooming relatively easy. They are moderate shedding dogs. Regular brushing helps manage loose hair and keeps their coat healthy and shiny. Brush them a few times a week with a rubber curry brush or a soft bristle brush. This distributes natural oils and removes dirt.

Bathing should be done as needed, typically every 4-6 weeks or when they get dirty. Use a mild dog shampoo to avoid irritating their skin. Over-bathing can strip natural oils, leading to dry skin. Always rinse thoroughly to prevent skin issues.

### Ear Care

Ear care is very important for this mix, especially if they have floppy ears like a Dachshund or deep folds like a French Bulldog. Both ear types can trap moisture and debris. This creates a breeding ground for infections. Check their ears weekly for redness, odor, or discharge.

Clean their ears gently with a vet-approved ear cleaner. Avoid using cotton swabs deep in the ear canal. You can learn [how to clean Dachshund ears](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dachshund-ears). This general ear cleaning method applies to your mix as well. Regular cleaning helps prevent painful ear infections.

### Dental Hygiene

Dental health is often overlooked but is crucial for dogs. Small breeds, including Dachshunds and French Bulldogs, are prone to dental disease. Brushing your Doxie Frenchie's teeth several times a week, or even daily, is ideal. Use a dog-specific toothbrush and toothpaste.

Regular dental check-ups with your veterinarian are also important. They can perform professional cleanings when necessary. Good dental hygiene prevents bad breath, gum disease, and tooth loss. It also impacts overall health.

### Nail Trimming

Regular nail trimming is necessary. Long nails can cause discomfort and pain. They can also lead to foot problems or make walking difficult. Trim your dog's nails every 3-4 weeks. Use dog nail clippers. Be careful not to cut into the quick, which is the sensitive part of the nail.

If you are unsure how to trim nails, ask your veterinarian or a professional groomer for a demonstration. Early exposure to nail trimming helps puppies get used to the process. Make it a positive experience with treats.

### Feeding: Diet and Weight Management

A balanced diet is vital for your Dachshund French Bulldog mix. Feed them high-quality dog food appropriate for their age, size, and activity level. Consult your veterinarian for specific dietary recommendations. Small breed formulas are often suitable.

Weight management is extremely important. Both parent breeds can be prone to obesity. Obesity puts extra strain on their joints and spine. It also worsens breathing issues in Frenchie-like mixes. Measure food portions carefully. Limit treats. Provide regular
