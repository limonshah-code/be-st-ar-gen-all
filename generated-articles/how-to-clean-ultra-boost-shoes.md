Cleaning Ultra Boost shoes involves specific steps. You need gentle solutions and soft tools. Focus on the Primeknit upper and the Boost midsole separately. Use a mild soap, warm water, and a soft brush. For tough stains, use a dedicated sneaker cleaner. Always air dry your shoes away from direct heat.

## Understanding Ultra Boost Materials

Ultra Boost shoes use unique materials. These materials give the shoe its comfort and performance. Knowing what your shoes are made of helps you clean them right. The main parts are the Primeknit upper and the Boost midsole.

Primeknit is a woven fabric. It is soft and flexible. This material forms the top part of the shoe. It gives a sock-like fit. Primeknit can trap dirt and stains easily. It needs gentle cleaning. Harsh scrubbing can damage the weave.

The Boost midsole is different. It is made of small TPU pellets. These pellets are expanded and fused together. This creates a soft, responsive foam. The Boost material is often white. It can yellow or get dirty quickly. It is also quite porous. This means it absorbs dirt.

The outsole uses Continental rubber. This rubber provides good grip. It is durable. You can clean it like most shoe soles. The inside lining and laces also need attention. Each part needs its own care. Cleaning different parts correctly keeps your whole shoe looking great.

## Essential Tools and Cleaning Solutions

Having the right tools makes cleaning your Ultra Boost shoes easy. You do not need many items. Simple household supplies often work well. Specialized sneaker cleaning kits are also available.

First, you need a few soft brushes. A soft-bristle brush works for the Primeknit upper. An old toothbrush is perfect for small crevices. You might also want a medium-stiff brush for the outsole. This helps remove stubborn dirt from the bottom.

Next, choose your cleaning solution. Mild dish soap mixed with warm water is a good option. Use a small amount of soap. You can also use a dedicated sneaker cleaner. These cleaners are safe for all shoe materials. They are designed to lift dirt without damage. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach. Bleach can ruin colors and materials.

You will also need some clean cloths. Microfiber towels work best. They are absorbent and soft. A bowl of warm water is essential for rinsing. Finally, gather some paper towels or a drying rack. These help with the drying process. Having everything ready saves time. It also makes the cleaning process smoother.

## Hand Washing Your Ultra Boost Shoes

Hand washing is the safest way to clean your Ultra Boost shoes. It gives you control over the process. You can focus on specific dirty areas. This method is gentle on the Primeknit and Boost materials.

First, remove the laces and insoles. Wash them separately. You can put them in a mesh laundry bag. Then place them in the washing machine. Or, you can hand wash them with mild soap and water. Set them aside to dry.

Next, remove loose dirt from the shoes. Use a dry, soft brush. Brush off any mud or debris. This stops dirt from spreading during washing. Now, prepare your cleaning solution. Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water in a bowl. Do not use too much soap.

Dip your soft-bristle brush into the soapy water. Gently scrub the Primeknit upper. Use light, circular motions. Work on small sections at a time. Do not saturate the fabric. Wipe away excess foam with a clean, damp cloth. Repeat until the upper is clean.

Now, clean the Boost midsole. This part often gets very dirty. Dip a soft brush or an old toothbrush into the solution. Gently scrub the Boost material. For tough marks, try a magic eraser. Lightly rub the eraser on the dirty areas. Be careful not to press too hard. Wipe off residue with a damp cloth. You can also clean the rubber outsole with a stiffer brush. Once clean, pat the shoes dry with a clean towel.

## Machine Washing Your Ultra Boost Shoes

Machine washing Ultra Boost shoes is possible. It can save time. However, it carries some risks. Always follow specific steps to protect your shoes. I only machine wash my shoes when they are very dirty.

First, prepare your shoes. Remove the laces and insoles. You should always wash these separately. Put them into a mesh laundry bag. This stops them from getting tangled or lost. Use this same bag for your shoes.

Next, pre-treat any major stains. Apply a small amount of mild cleaner directly to the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes. You can also gently scrub the spot with a soft brush. This helps loosen the dirt.

Place your Ultra Boost shoes inside a mesh laundry bag. Put a few old towels into the washing machine. This cushions the shoes during the wash cycle. It prevents them from banging around. This protects both your shoes and your washing machine.

Choose the right settings on your machine. Use a cold water cycle. Select a delicate or gentle wash setting. Use a small amount of mild liquid detergent. Avoid harsh powders or bleach. Never use hot water. Hot water can damage the glue and fabrics. Once the cycle finishes, take your shoes out immediately. Do not put them in the dryer. Machine washing can be effective. Just remember to be gentle.

## Tackling Stubborn Stains and Yellowing Boost

Sometimes, regular cleaning is not enough for tough stains. Ultra Boost shoes, especially white ones, can show dirt easily. Yellowing on the Boost midsole is also a common problem. You can fix these issues with targeted methods.

For stubborn stains on the Primeknit, try a stronger spot cleaner. Apply a small amount directly to the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then, gently scrub with a soft brush. Work the cleaner into the fabric. Wipe clean with a damp cloth. Repeat if needed. Do not rub too hard. This can damage the Primeknit weave. If you have light-colored shoes, you might also find helpful tips in our guide on [how to clean white shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes). For general tough stains, you can also reference our article on [how to clean stained shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stained-shoes).

Yellowing on the Boost midsole needs special attention. This yellowing happens over time from sun exposure and oxidation. You can use a dedicated de-yellowing solution. Apply the solution evenly to the yellowed Boost. Make sure to cover the entire affected area. Often, these solutions require UV light activation. Wrap the shoes in clear plastic wrap. Place them in direct sunlight for several hours. The UV rays help activate the solution. This process brings back the white color.

Alternatively, some people use a paste of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide. Mix equal parts to form a thick paste. Apply this paste to the yellowed Boost. Let it sit for a few hours. Then, rinse it off with water. Be careful not to get the peroxide on the Primeknit. Always test any new product in an inconspicuous area first. This prevents accidental damage.

## Drying Your Ultra Boost Shoes Properly

Drying your Ultra Boost shoes correctly is just as important as cleaning them. Improper drying can cause damage. It can also lead to bad odors or mildew. Patience is key here.

Never put your Ultra Boost shoes in a clothes dryer. High heat can melt the glue. It can shrink the Primeknit material. It can also warp the Boost midsole. This will ruin your shoes. Avoid direct sunlight too. Intense sun can yellow the Boost material. It can also fade the Primeknit color.

The best way to dry your shoes is air drying. After cleaning, blot them with a clean towel. This removes excess water. Then, stuff the shoes with paper towels or a dry cloth. This helps absorb moisture from the inside. It also helps the shoes keep their shape. Change the paper towels every few hours if they become damp.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area. A cool, dry room is ideal. You can put them near an open window. Avoid humid places like bathrooms. Allow plenty of time for them to dry completely. This can take 24 to 48 hours. Make sure they are totally dry before wearing them again. Wearing damp shoes can cause blisters. It also promotes bacteria growth. This leads to smelly shoes. Proper drying prevents these problems.

## Maintaining Your Ultra Boost Shoes

Keeping your Ultra Boost shoes clean is an ongoing task. Regular maintenance extends their life. It also keeps them looking great. A little care after each wear goes a long way.

First, try to wipe down your shoes after each use. A damp cloth can remove fresh dirt and dust. This stops grime from building up. Pay special attention to the Boost midsole. It picks up dirt easily. This quick wipe-down prevents stains from setting.

Consider using protective sprays. Many companies make water and stain repellent sprays for shoes. Apply these sprays to your clean, dry Ultra Boosts. They create a barrier. This barrier helps repel liquids and dirt. Reapply the spray every few weeks or months. Follow the product instructions.

Store your shoes properly. Keep them in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight. Shoe trees can help maintain their shape. This is especially true for the Primeknit upper. Do not store them in cramped or damp spaces. This can lead to odors or mold growth. If you ever find your shoes getting smelly, check out our guide on [how to clean smelly shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes).

Rotate your shoes. Do not wear the same pair every day. Give your shoes a chance to air out between wears. This helps them dry completely. It also reduces wear and tear. Regular, small cleaning efforts make a big difference. This routine keeps your Ultra Boosts looking new for longer.

## Common Ultra Boost Cleaning Mistakes to Avoid

Cleaning your Ultra Boost shoes is easy if you know what to avoid. Making common mistakes can damage your shoes. It can also shorten their lifespan. I have learned these lessons over time.

First, never use harsh chemicals. Bleach, strong detergents, or abrasive cleaners can ruin the Primeknit. They can also degrade the Boost material. These chemicals strip colors and weaken fabrics. Always opt for mild soap or dedicated sneaker cleaners.

Second, avoid using stiff brushes on the Primeknit. A stiff brush can fray the fabric. It can pull threads. Always use a soft-bristle brush for the upper. Save stiffer brushes for the rubber outsole only.

Third, do not put your shoes in the dryer. High heat is the enemy of Ultra Boosts. It causes glue to melt. It can shrink the knit material. It also deforms the delicate Boost foam. Air drying is the only safe method.

Fourth, do not soak your shoes completely. While some water is fine, saturating the shoes can be bad. It makes drying harder. It can also loosen adhesives inside the shoe. Focus on spot cleaning. If you must machine wash, use a delicate cycle and a laundry bag.

Finally, do not forget to clean the insoles and laces. Many people clean the outside but ignore the inside. Dirty insoles cause bad odors. They can also transfer dirt back to your clean socks. Always remove and wash them separately. Avoiding these mistakes helps keep your Ultra Boosts in top condition.
