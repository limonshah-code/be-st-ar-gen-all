## Simple Steps to Clean Your Resound Hearing Aids

Maintaining your Resound hearing aids well helps them work their best. It also makes them last longer. I understand you want clear sound every day. This happens when your hearing aids stay clean. Dirty hearing aids can cause many problems. These include poor sound quality or even damage. We will explore simple, effective ways for you to clean Resound hearing aids. This guide covers daily care, deeper weekly cleaning, and specific component upkeep. We also discuss common issues and tips to extend your device's life. Following these steps helps you hear well and keeps your devices in good shape.

### Takeaway

*   Clean your Resound hearing aids every day. Use a soft cloth and a brush.

To clean Resound hearing aids, you must use a dry, soft cloth and a small brush daily to remove earwax and debris. For deeper cleaning, replace wax guards and domes as needed, following the specific instructions for your hearing aid model. Avoid water and cleaning solutions not made for hearing aids.

## Why Cleaning Resound Hearing Aids Matters

Cleaning your Resound hearing aids is very important. It keeps them working well. Dirty hearing aids often do not sound clear. This happens because earwax and dirt can block the sound path. When I clean my devices, I notice a big difference in how I hear. Regular cleaning helps prevent these issues.

It also helps your hearing aids last longer. Dirt and moisture can damage the small parts inside. This damage can cost a lot to fix. A consistent cleaning routine protects your investment. It helps you get the most from your devices. You can learn more about how general cleaning improves device longevity at [how to clean everything](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-everything).

Clean hearing aids also mean healthier ears for you. Earwax and moisture can build up on the device. This can lead to ear infections or skin irritation. Keeping the devices clean reduces these risks. It makes wearing them more comfortable for you. I find peace of mind knowing my ears stay healthy.

Not cleaning your hearing aids can lead to common problems. Sound may become muffled or weak. The device might make whistling noises. It could even stop working completely. These issues often come from simple dirt buildup. A few minutes of cleaning can prevent these frustrations.

Think of your hearing aids as small, important tools. They need regular care to do their job. Just like you clean your glasses for clear vision, you clean your hearing aids for clear sound. A clean device gives you a better hearing experience. It helps you connect with the world around you.

## Essential Tools for Cleaning Resound Hearing Aids

Having the right tools makes cleaning your Resound hearing aids easy. You do not need many items. The proper tools help you clean effectively without causing damage. I always keep my cleaning kit handy. This ensures I can clean my hearing aids any time.

Most Resound hearing aids come with a basic cleaning kit. This kit often includes a small brush and a wax pick or loop tool. The brush helps remove surface debris. The wax pick cleans out stubborn wax from small openings. These two tools are your main helpers.

You will also need a soft, dry cloth. A microfiber cloth works best. It does not leave lint behind. This cloth is perfect for wiping down the entire device. It helps remove oils and moisture from the surface. I use a clean cloth every time.

Some Resound models may use specific wax guards or domes. These are small, disposable parts. You might need a tool to remove them. Your audiologist can show you which ones you need. You can often buy these from your clinic or online.

Never use water directly on your hearing aids. Do not use alcohol, harsh cleaners, or solvents. These can damage the electronics inside. Only use cleaning sprays made for hearing aids if your audiologist suggests it. For general cleaning principles that emphasize gentle methods, you can review tips on [how to clean glass](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-glass).

It is also good to have a hearing aid drying kit or dehumidifier. This removes moisture that builds up during wear. Moisture can cause problems over time. A dryer helps keep the internal parts safe. This protects your device from damage.

## Daily Cleaning Routine for Resound Hearing Aids

A daily cleaning routine keeps your Resound hearing aids in top shape. This routine takes only a few minutes. Doing it every day prevents major wax buildup. I always clean my hearing aids before I go to bed. This gives them time to air out.

First, wipe down the entire hearing aid with a soft, dry cloth. This removes fingerprints, oils, and surface dirt. Make sure the cloth is lint-free. Gently wipe all parts of the casing. This step is simple but very important.

Next, use the small brush provided with your hearing aid. Brush away any visible earwax or debris. Focus on the microphone ports and the sound outlet. These are the small holes where sound goes in and out. Wax can easily block them. Brush downwards so debris falls off the device.

If your Resound hearing aid has an ear mold or dome, clean that part too. For domes, gently wipe them with the dry cloth. For ear molds, brush away any wax from the opening. Some Resound models, like behind-the-ear (BTE) devices, have tubes and molds. Ensure the tube is clear. You can find similar daily cleaning practices for other brands at [how to clean Widex hearing aids](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-widex-hearing-aids).

Check the battery compartment door. Ensure it is free of dirt. If you use disposable batteries, open the door to let air circulate overnight. This helps moisture escape. Remove the battery if you store the device for a longer period.

After cleaning, place your hearing aids in a drying kit or dehumidifier. This helps remove any moisture that collected during the day. Moisture is a big enemy of hearing aids. It can cause corrosion and damage over time. This daily step protects your device.

## Weekly Deep Cleaning for Resound Hearing Aids

Beyond daily care, a weekly deep clean for your Resound hearing aids is vital. This takes a bit more time but ensures long-term performance. I set aside a specific time each week for this task. It helps me remember to do it thoroughly.

Start by performing your usual daily cleaning steps. Wipe the device, and brush off visible debris. This prepares the hearing aid for a more detailed inspection. Cleanliness for even small and intricate devices is key. Consider how you might approach cleaning fine details, as detailed in guides like [how to clean fan](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-fan).

**Focus on the Earwax Guard:**
Many Resound hearing aids have a wax guard. This tiny filter stops earwax from getting into the receiver.
*   **Check the wax guard:** Look closely at the small opening where sound comes out. If you see wax clogging it, it is time to change the wax guard.
*   **Remove the old wax guard:** Resound wax guards often come on a stick tool. One end removes the old guard, the other inserts a new one. Follow your specific model's instructions.
*   **Insert a new wax guard:** Push the new guard firmly into place. Make sure it sits flush. This simple step can fix many sound problems.

**Clean or Replace Domes:**
Domes are the small, silicone tips that fit over the receiver. They come in different sizes and styles.
*   **Inspect the dome:** Look for tears, discoloration, or heavy wax buildup.
*   **Clean the dome:** If it is only lightly soiled, you can remove it and wipe it with a dry cloth. You can also gently brush it.
*   **Replace the dome:** If the dome is stiff, discolored, or damaged, replace it. Domes are inexpensive and come in packs.

**Cleaning Ear Molds and Tubing (for BTE models):**
If you have a Behind-The-Ear (BTE) Resound hearing aid, you have a custom ear mold and tubing.
*   **Separate the ear mold:** Gently disconnect the ear mold from the hearing aid hook.
*   **Wash the ear mold:** You can wash the ear mold and tubing in warm, soapy water. Use a mild soap. Rinse them well under running water. Ensure no soap residue remains. This is like cleaning larger items, such as following general cleaning practices in your [sink](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-sink).
*   **Dry completely:** Shake out excess water. Use a hearing aid air blower to push water out of the tubing. Let the mold and tubing air dry completely overnight on a clean cloth. They must be bone-dry before reattaching them to the hearing aid. Moisture can damage the electronic part.

This weekly deep cleaning prevents big problems. It keeps your sound clear and strong. It also helps your Resound hearing aids last for many years.

## Addressing Specific Resound Hearing Aid Components

Each part of your Resound hearing aid plays a role in sound quality. Knowing how to care for specific components helps maintain their function. I pay close attention to these small parts during my cleaning routine. Neglecting them can lead to poor performance.

### Wax Guards

Wax guards are small, white filters located at the end of the sound outlet. They prevent earwax from entering the receiver. Earwax is a common cause of muffled sound.
*   **Frequency:** Change your wax guard every few weeks, or sooner if sound becomes unclear. I always check mine if my hearing aid sounds quiet.
*   **Procedure:** Resound usually provides a tool for changing wax guards. This tool has two ends: one for removing the old guard and one for inserting a new one.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Hold the hearing aid firmly.
    2.  Insert the empty end of the tool into the old wax guard.
    3.  Pull straight out to remove the old guard.
    4.  Flip the tool. Insert the new wax guard end into the hearing aid's sound outlet.
    5.  Push gently until the new guard is secure.
    6.  Remove the tool.

### Domes

Domes are soft, silicone tips covering the receiver. They sit inside your ear canal. They come in various shapes and sizes (e.g., open, closed, power).
*   **Frequency:** Domes should be replaced every 1-3 months, or sooner if they are damaged or discolored.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Gently pull off the old dome from the receiver. It should slide off easily.
    2.  Check the receiver tip for any wax buildup. Brush it clean if needed.
    3.  Push a new, clean dome onto the receiver tip. Make sure it is fully seated and secure.

### Tubes (for BTE models)

For Behind-The-Ear (BTE) Resound hearing aids, the tubing connects the hearing aid to the ear mold.
*   **Frequency:** Inspect tubes daily. Replace them every 3-6 months, or if they become stiff, discolored, or cracked.
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Detach the ear mold and tube from the hearing aid.
    2.  If the tube is discolored or stiff, it is time to replace it. Your audiologist can provide new tubing.
    3.  To clean an existing tube, run a thin wire or a specialized cleaning tool through it. This removes any moisture or debris. You can also blow air through it. For more detailed insights on cleaning small, intricate items, you can refer to [how to clean ring](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-ring).
    4.  Ensure the tube is completely dry before reattaching it.

### Battery Contacts and Charger Ports

For battery-powered hearing aids, clean the battery contacts. For rechargeable ones, clean the charging ports.
*   **Frequency:** Check them weekly or if your device has power issues.
*   **Procedure:** Use a dry cotton swab or a soft, dry brush. Gently wipe away any dust or debris. Do not use anything wet. Keeping these areas clean ensures good power connection.

Proper care for these components keeps your Resound hearing aids working efficiently. It helps you avoid unexpected issues.

## Troubleshooting Common Cleaning Issues with Resound Aids

Even with regular cleaning, you might face some issues with your Resound hearing aids. Knowing how to troubleshoot these problems can save you a trip to the audiologist. I have learned to solve many minor issues myself through simple checks.

### Muffled or Weak Sound

This is the most common problem. Often, it means something is blocking the sound.
*   **Check the wax guard:** This is the first place to look. A clogged wax guard can severely reduce sound. Replace it immediately if it looks dirty. I always carry spare wax guards for this reason.
*   **Inspect the dome or ear mold:** Look for visible earwax inside the dome or in the ear mold opening. Brush it out. If the dome is torn or very dirty, replace it.
*   **Check the tubing (BTE models):** If your Resound hearing aid has tubing, check for condensation or wax buildup inside it. Use an air blower to clear moisture. If the tube is kinked or stiff, it might need replacing.

### Device Not Turning On or Intermittent Power

This problem is usually related to power.
*   **Batteries:** If you use disposable batteries, check that they are inserted correctly. Make sure they are not dead. Try a new battery. Make sure the battery contacts are clean and free of corrosion.
*   **Rechargeable:** Ensure the hearing aid is sitting properly in its charger. Clean the charging contacts on both the hearing aid and the charger. Dust can prevent a good connection.
*   **Moisture:** Excessive moisture can interfere with electronic components. Place your hearing aid in a drying kit for several hours, or even overnight. This often resolves moisture-related power issues.

### Whistling or Feedback

Feedback is a high-pitched whistling sound. It means sound is leaking out and re-entering the microphone.
*   **Improper fit:** The most common cause is a poor fit in your ear. Reinsert the hearing aid firmly. Make sure the dome or ear mold forms a good seal.
*   **Earwax in your ear:** If your ear canal is full of wax, it can block the sound from going into your ear. This pushes sound out of the ear, causing feedback. Clean your ears or see a doctor for earwax removal.
*   **Damaged dome or tubing:** Check your dome for tears or cracks. A damaged dome cannot create a proper seal. Check the tubing for cracks or stiffness. These need replacement.

### When to Contact Your Audiologist

Some problems need professional help.
*   If you have tried all the cleaning and troubleshooting steps and the problem remains, contact your audiologist.
*   If your hearing aid is physically damaged (e.g., stepped on, dropped in water).
*   If you hear strange static or buzzing noises that do not go away.
*   If the device simply stops working without obvious cause.

Your audiologist has special tools and expertise. They can diagnose complex issues or perform repairs. Regular professional check-ups are also part of good hearing aid care.

## Tips for Extending the Life of Your Resound Hearing Aids

Proper care helps your Resound hearing aids last longer. These small steps protect your investment. I always follow these guidelines to get the most from my devices. They are delicate electronic instruments.

### Keep Them Dry

Moisture is the biggest enemy of hearing aids. Sweat, humidity, and rain can damage the internal components.
*   **Use a drying kit:** Place your hearing aids in a drying kit or dehumidifier every night. These kits remove moisture effectively. Some chargers for rechargeable Resound aids also have a drying function.
*   **Avoid water:** Never wear your hearing aids in the shower, while swimming, or in heavy rain. Remove them before using hairspray, perfume, or other aerosols. These products can clog microphone ports.
*   **Wipe after sweating:** If you exercise or sweat heavily, wipe your hearing aids with a dry cloth immediately after removing them. This helps remove surface moisture. Protecting devices from moisture is similar to how you care for larger items like a [mattress](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mattress) to prevent mildew.

### Store Them Properly

Where you store your hearing aids matters.
*   **Safe place:** Store them in their case or a designated safe place when not in use. This protects them from accidental drops or being lost.
*   **Cool, dry place:** Avoid storing them in bathrooms, on windowsills, or near heat sources like radiators. High humidity and extreme temperatures can cause damage.
*   **Out of reach:** Keep them away from pets and young children. Pets can chew on them, and children might play with or damage them.

### Handle Them Gently

Hearing aids contain small, delicate electronics.
*   **Avoid dropping:** Always handle your hearing aids over a soft surface like a towel or a bed. This cushions any accidental drops.
*   **Clean gently:** Use only the provided tools. Do not use sharp objects or excessive force when cleaning. This can scratch or break parts.
*   **Insert and remove carefully:** Follow the proper insertion and removal techniques your audiologist showed you. Pulling roughly can damage the tubing or wires.

### Professional Check-ups

Regular visits to your audiologist are crucial.
*   **Scheduled appointments:** Your audiologist can perform professional cleanings. They have specialized tools to remove deep-seated wax or debris.
*   **Performance checks:** They can check the hearing aids' performance and make adjustments. They can also identify potential issues before they become major problems.
*   **Ear health:** They can also check your ear health. Sometimes, hearing problems come from your ear, not the device.

By following these simple tips, you can extend the life of your Resound hearing aids. You ensure they keep providing clear sound for many years. This care pays off with reliable performance every day.
