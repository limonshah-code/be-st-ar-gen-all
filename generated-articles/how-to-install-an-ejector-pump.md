*   **Connect Discharge Pipe to Pump:** Connect the discharge pipe from the pump's outlet. Use appropriate fittings and pipe cement.
*   **Install Check Valve:** Install a full-flow check valve immediately above the pump's discharge outlet. This prevents pumped water from flowing back into the basin. Ensure the flow arrow on the check valve points upwards, away from the pump.
*   **Install Isolation Valve:** Install a gate valve or ball valve above the check valve. This allows you to shut off the flow for maintenance without emptying the entire discharge line.
*   **Route Discharge Pipe:** Run the discharge pipe vertically from the basin to the main sewer line. Ensure it connects to the sewer line using a Wye fitting for proper flow. Slope horizontal runs slightly towards the main line.

### 4. Connecting the Vent Pipe

The vent pipe equalizes pressure and vents gases from the basin.

*   **Connect Vent Pipe:** Route a vent pipe from the top of the basin (using a sealed grommet) and connect it to your home's existing vent stack.
*   **Maintain Slope:** Ensure the vent pipe has a slight slope back towards the basin to allow any condensation to drain.

### 5. Electrical Wiring

This step requires strict adherence to safety and local codes.

*   **Connect Pump Wiring:** Route the pump's power cord and the float switch cord through the designated opening in the basin lid. Use a cord seal to maintain a watertight seal.
*   **Connect to Power Source:** Connect the pump's wiring to your dedicated GFCI-protected electrical circuit. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and local electrical codes. If you are not comfortable, hire a licensed electrician.
*   **Secure Wires:** Coil excess wiring inside the basin so it does not interfere with the float switch.

### 6. Sealing the Basin Lid

A properly sealed basin lid prevents odors and gas leaks.

*   **Apply Sealant:** Apply a continuous bead of silicone caulk or gasket sealant around the rim of the basin where the lid sits.
*   **Secure the Lid:** Place the lid securely on the basin and fasten it down. Many lids have bolt-down clamps. Ensure a tight, airtight seal.
