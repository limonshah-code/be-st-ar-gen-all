Sparkler exits are a favorite for evening weddings. They provide a magical glow as you walk through a tunnel of light. Guests hold long sparklers, creating a shimmering path. The photos from a sparkler exit are truly breathtaking.

To ensure safety, buy long sparklers (20-36 inches). Appoint a few responsible people to hand them out. Provide buckets of water or sand for easy disposal. Tell guests to keep sparklers away from clothes and hair. This simple setup makes for a truly grand send off.

Tossing confetti or flower petals adds a burst of color and joy to your exit. This tradition symbolizes good wishes and blessings for the couple. It is a vibrant and cheerful way to say goodbye. The falling petals or confetti look wonderful in photos.

### Rice Toss: A Classic Symbol

Throwing rice is one of the oldest wedding traditions. It symbolizes fertility and prosperity for the newlyweds. Many cultures still use this method for a classic send off. The tiny grains create a light, showering effect.

Check with your venue before planning a rice toss. Some places ban rice due to bird safety concerns or cleanup issues. As an alternative, consider birdseed or dried lavender. These options offer a similar look with less impact. This method ensures your exit is both traditional and considerate.
