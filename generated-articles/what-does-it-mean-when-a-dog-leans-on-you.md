## Attention-Seeking Behavior: A Dog's Request for Interaction

A dog might lean on you simply because they want your attention. They have learned that leaning often gets a positive reaction from you. Maybe you pet them, talk to them, or even get up to play. They use leaning as a gentle nudge to say, "Hey, I'm here! Look at me!"

This type of lean is often a precursor to other attention-getting behaviors. Your dog might lean, then look up at you with puppy dog eyes. They might then shift their weight, waiting for you to respond. This is a subtle way of asking for something. Perhaps they want to go for a walk, or need to eat, or just want some cuddles.
