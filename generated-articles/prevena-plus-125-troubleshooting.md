#### How to Respond to Alarms

Responding to a Prevena Plus 125 alarm correctly is important. Do not panic. Follow a set procedure. This ensures patient safety and effective therapy. Your actions make a difference.

First, press the silence button on the device. This stops the beeping. It gives you time to assess the situation without noise. The alarm message remains on the screen.

Next, read the message on the screen. This message tells you the exact problem. For instance, if it says "Low Vacuum," you know to look for leaks. If it says "Canister Full," you know what to change.

Then, follow the device's suggested actions. The device often gives a simple instruction. For many device troubleshooting scenarios, consulting the user manual provides specific guidance. This applies to your Prevena Plus 125 device as well. Just as you might troubleshoot a [Keurig K-Supreme Plus troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/keurig-k-supreme-plus-troubleshooting) issue or tackle a problem with your [Tempra Plus water heater troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/tempra-plus-water-heater-troubleshooting), the Prevena system offers clear pathways to resolution when problems arise.

If the alarm persists after your actions, re-evaluate. You might have missed something small. If the problem is complex or unresolved, contact your healthcare provider. They can provide further help or replace the device. Always prioritize patient comfort and wound integrity.

### Addressing Dressing Seal Leaks and Loss of Therapy

A good seal is vital for Prevena Plus 125 therapy. The device works by creating negative pressure. This pressure pulls fluid from the wound. If air leaks into the system, the device cannot maintain pressure. This stops the therapy from working. A leak is a common cause of "low vacuum" alarms.

Loss of therapy means the wound does not receive the intended negative pressure. This can slow down healing. It can also risk wound complications. You must find and fix any leaks fast. A proper seal keeps the therapy effective.

#### Identifying a Leak

Finding a leak in your Prevena Plus 125 dressing takes careful observation. The device will sound a "low vacuum" alarm. This is your first sign. The display screen confirms the alarm. You must visually inspect the dressing.

Look for areas where the dressing lifts from the skin. Pay attention to the edges. Sometimes, skin folds or hair can prevent a good seal. Also, check around the tube attachment site. This area is common for leaks.

You might hear a hissing sound. This sound means air escapes. Gently press down on the dressing over the wound area. If the alarm stops, you have found the leak location. Use your hands to feel for cool air coming from under the dressing. This also indicates an air leak.

#### Re-establishing the Seal

Once you identify the leak, you must re-establish the seal. This is often a simple fix. You can usually do this without removing the entire dressing. This saves time and resources.

Use additional dressing strips or sterile tape. Apply these strips firmly over the leaking area. Make sure they overlap with the existing dressing. Press down gently but firmly. The goal is to create a complete seal again.

If the leak is large or the dressing is too loose, you may need to apply a new dressing. Always follow your healthcare provider's instructions for dressing changes. Ensure the skin is clean and dry before applying. A good seal ensures the Prevena Plus 125 delivers proper therapy.

### Managing Battery and Power Issues

The Prevena Plus 125 runs on battery power. It also uses an AC adapter for charging. Battery issues can interrupt therapy. A device without power cannot provide wound care. Understanding how to manage the battery is crucial. This ensures continuous operation.

Always monitor the battery indicator on the device screen. It shows the current charge level. If the battery gets low, the device will alert you. Pay attention to these alerts. They give you time to connect the charger.

#### Charging the Device

Charging your Prevena Plus 125 device is straightforward. Use only the power adapter provided with the system. Using other adapters can damage the device. It might also void the warranty.

Connect the power adapter to the charging port on the device. Then, plug the adapter into a wall outlet. Make sure the outlet works. The charging indicator light on the device will turn on. This shows it is charging.

The device can run while it charges. This means therapy continues without interruption. Keep the device plugged in whenever possible, especially overnight. This keeps the battery full. Always ensure the charging cable is not a tripping hazard. This ensures safety for everyone around the device.

#### Battery Life and Replacement

Prevena Plus 125 battery life varies. It depends on usage and settings. A fully charged battery typically lasts for several hours. High therapy settings may drain the battery faster. Check the user manual for exact battery life expectations.

Over time, all rechargeable batteries lose their ability to hold a charge. If your battery drains quickly, it might need replacement. Do not try to replace the battery yourself. Prevena Plus 125 batteries are internal.

Contact your healthcare provider or the device manufacturer. They can arrange for battery testing or device replacement. Proper battery care extends the life of the device. Following proper charging protocols also helps. Always handle medical devices carefully. This includes ensuring power for your device. For general device power management, consider how similar principles apply to other electronics, such as managing power for a [Noco Boost Plus GB40 troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/noco-boost-plus-gb40-troubleshooting) scenario, where power is key.

### Resolving Canister and Tubing Problems

The canister collects wound fluid. The tubing connects the dressing to the canister and the device. These parts are vital for fluid management. Problems with either can stop therapy. You need to ensure they work correctly.

A full or blocked canister stops fluid collection. Kinked or clogged tubing stops fluid flow. Both issues trigger alarms. They prevent the negative pressure from reaching the wound. Regular checks of these components are good practice.

#### Canister Full or Blocked

The Prevena Plus 125 device detects a full canister. It sounds an alarm. The screen will show a "Canister Full" message. When this happens, therapy stops. You must change the canister immediately.

To change the canister, first, disconnect the tubing from the old canister. You might need to clamp the tubing. Then, unlatch the old canister from the device. Dispose of the old canister as medical waste. Always follow local guidelines for biohazard disposal.

Install a new, empty canister. Make sure it clicks into place securely. Connect the tubing to the new canister. Ensure all connections are tight. This restarts the therapy. If the alarm persists, the canister might be blocked by thick fluid. A new canister often fixes this.

#### Tubing Kinks and Occlusions

Tubing problems can stop therapy flow. Kinks in the tubing are common. They happen when the tube bends sharply. The tube can also get pinched under the patient or bedding. An occlusion means something blocks the tube internally. This could be dried fluid or debris.

Check the entire length of the tubing. Look for any visible kinks or pinches. Straighten any bends you find. Ensure the tubing runs freely without restriction. Sometimes, simply repositioning the patient helps.

If you suspect an internal blockage, gently milk the tubing. Start near the dressing and move towards the canister. This might dislodge a small clog. If the tubing remains blocked, or if an alarm persists, consult your healthcare provider. They might suggest replacing the tubing or dressing. Ensuring clear tubing is as important for medical devices as understanding how to troubleshoot general mechanical systems like a [Liftmaster Security Plus 20 troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/liftmaster-security-plus-20-troubleshooting) issue, where clear pathways are critical for operation.

### Device Malfunctions and System Errors

Sometimes, the Prevena Plus 125 device shows a malfunction or system error. These are more serious problems. They mean the device itself has an issue. Unlike a low battery or full canister, these problems are often internal. You cannot fix them with simple user actions.

When a device malfunction alarm sounds, the screen shows an error code. This code tells technicians about the specific problem. It might indicate a sensor failure or a pump issue. Do not attempt to repair the device yourself. This can cause more damage. It can also void the warranty.

#### Common Error Codes

The Prevena Plus 125 has a range of error codes. Each code points to a specific internal problem. For example, an "E-01" code might mean a pump failure. An "E-02" could signal a pressure sensor error. These codes are not for the end user to diagnose. They are for trained service personnel.

When you see an error code, write it down. This information is very helpful for technical support. It helps them understand the issue faster. Do not try to reset the device multiple times if the error persists. Repeated attempts can sometimes worsen the problem.

Your main action is to record the code. Then, prepare to contact support. They will guide you on the next steps. They might ask you to perform a simple reset. More likely, they will arrange for a device exchange.

#### When to Contact Support

You should contact support immediately for device malfunctions or persistent system errors. This includes any error code that you cannot clear. Also contact support if the device does not turn on. If the device repeatedly loses suction without a clear cause, call them.

Contact your healthcare provider first. They often have protocols for device issues. They may instruct you to call the manufacturer directly. The Prevena Plus 125 is made by KCI, an Acelity company. Their support team handles technical issues.
