## How To Clean Maytag Washing Machine

My Maytag washing machine helps me keep my clothes fresh and clean. But sometimes, it needs a clean itself. Over time, residue, detergent, and fabric softener can build up inside the washer. This causes unpleasant odors and can even affect how well your clothes get cleaned. Learning how to clean your Maytag washing machine helps maintain its performance and extends its life.

This guide provides clear instructions for cleaning both Maytag front-load and top-load models. I will walk you through the essential supplies you need and specific steps for each part of your machine. We will cover common issues like mold, mildew, and "scrud." You will also find tips for daily maintenance to keep your washer smelling fresh and working efficiently. Let's make your Maytag sparkle!

### Takeaway

*   Regularly clean your Maytag washing machine to prevent odors and residue.
*   Use vinegar or bleach in a self-clean cycle.
*   Clean specific components like the gasket, dispenser, and filter.
*   Follow machine-specific instructions for front-loaders and top-loaders.
*   Practice simple daily habits to keep your washer fresh.

**To clean a Maytag washing machine, run a self-clean cycle monthly using a washing machine cleaner, vinegar, or bleach. Wipe down interior surfaces and door seals regularly. Address dispensers, filters, and other removable parts to remove soap scum and residue, ensuring the machine stays fresh and functional.**

### Why Cleaning Your Maytag Washer Matters

You might think a washing machine cleans itself because it uses soap and water. This is not true. Over time, dirt from clothes, hard water minerals, detergent, and fabric softener residues build up inside your Maytag washer. This mixture creates a film that can harbor bacteria and mold. These unseen deposits lead to a musty smell that transfers to your laundry. My clothes started smelling less than fresh, and I knew it was time for a deep clean.

Regular cleaning helps your Maytag washing machine work better. When residue builds up, it can clog hoses and affect the machine's efficiency. The water may not drain properly, or clothes might not rinse completely. This means your machine uses more energy and water to do the same job. By cleaning your Maytag, you ensure clothes come out truly clean and smelling great. It also helps extend the lifespan of your appliance. A well-maintained machine simply lasts longer, saving you money on repairs or replacements. It is a simple step that yields big rewards for your laundry routine.

Failing to clean your Maytag washer can also void your warranty in some cases. Manufacturers expect users to perform basic maintenance. They often include cleaning instructions in the ownerâ€™s manual. Ignoring these steps allows mold and mildew to grow, especially in damp areas like the door gasket of a front-loader. These issues cause bad odors and potential health concerns. Investing a small amount of time into cleaning prevents these larger, more difficult problems. Think of it as a small chore that protects a large investment.

Beyond odors, residue can appear as "scrud," a gray, greasy buildup. This scrud can stick to your clothes, leaving stains after a wash. I have seen this happen, and it is frustrating to find clean clothes covered in machine residue. This problem is especially common if you use too much detergent or fabric softener. Proper cleaning removes this scrud, keeping your clothes spotless. A clean Maytag washing machine makes laundry day a much more pleasant experience.

### Essential Supplies for Cleaning Your Maytag

Before you start cleaning your Maytag washing machine, gather all the necessary supplies. Having everything ready makes the process smooth and efficient. You probably have most of these items already in your home. I keep a dedicated cleaning kit for my appliances to make sure I am always prepared.

First, you will need a good cleaning agent. White vinegar is an excellent natural option. It breaks down mineral deposits and kills mold and bacteria. You can also use baking soda, which is good for absorbing odors and providing a gentle abrasive scrub. For tougher jobs, or if your machine has a severe mold problem, you might consider using bleach. However, never mix bleach and vinegar, as this creates harmful fumes. Some Maytag models also recommend specific washing machine cleaning tablets or powders. Always check your Maytag owner's manual for specific product recommendations or warnings.

You will also need various tools for physical cleaning. Microfiber cloths are great for wiping down surfaces because they absorb well and do not leave lint. An old toothbrush or a small cleaning brush is perfect for scrubbing tight spaces like detergent dispensers or gasket folds. For front-loaders, you might want a spray bottle to mix water and vinegar for spraying the gasket. A bucket or small bowl can be useful for removing and soaking removable parts. Finally, make sure you have gloves to protect your hands, especially if you are using bleach.

Here is a simple list of supplies you should have on hand:

*   **White Vinegar:** Essential for breaking down residue and odors.
*   **Baking Soda:** Good for absorbing smells and light scrubbing.
*   **Bleach:** For sanitization and tough mold (use with caution, never with vinegar).
*   **Washing Machine Cleaner:** Maytag-recommended tablets or powders.
*   **Microfiber Cloths:** For wiping surfaces.
*   **Old Toothbrush or Small Brush:** For scrubbing tight spots.
*   **Spray Bottle:** For mixing and applying solutions.
*   **Gloves:** To protect your hands.
*   **Bucket or Bowl:** For soaking small parts.

Having these items ready ensures you can thoroughly clean your Maytag machine from top to bottom. Preparing these items means you avoid stopping midway through the cleaning process to search for a tool. This preparation saves time and makes cleaning less of a chore.

### How to Clean a Maytag Front-Load Washing Machine

Front-load Maytag washing machines are popular for their efficiency and gentle care of clothes. However, their design, especially the door gasket, can trap moisture and cause mold or mildew. This section outlines the specific steps to [clean your Maytag front-load washer effectively](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-drum). I clean my front-loader once a month to keep it fresh and odor-free.

#### Cleaning the Gasket (Door Seal)

The rubber gasket around the door is a common spot for mold and grime. Always start here. Pull back the folds of the rubber seal. You will likely find a collection of lint, hair, and slimy residue. I use a spray bottle filled with equal parts white vinegar and water. Spray the entire gasket area thoroughly. Let it sit for a few minutes to loosen the grime.

Next, take a clean microfiber cloth and wipe away all the visible dirt and mold. For stubborn spots, use an old toothbrush dipped in the vinegar solution or a bleach solution (1/4 cup bleach to 1 gallon water) to scrub. Make sure to get into all the crevices. After scrubbing, wipe the area dry with a fresh cloth. Leaving the gasket wet encourages mold to grow back quickly. For more detailed instructions on this area, check out how to [clean the rubber gasket in your washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-rubber-gasket-in-washing-machine).

#### Cleaning the Detergent Dispenser

The detergent and fabric softener dispenser can get clogged with sticky residue. This affects how these products dispense into your wash. My dispenser always seems to get gunked up. If your dispenser is removable, pull it out. Soak it in a sink filled with hot water and dish soap for about 30 minutes. Use a small brush or an old toothbrush to scrub away any remaining residue. Rinse it thoroughly and let it air dry before putting it back.

If your dispenser is not removable, use a spray bottle with white vinegar to spray inside the compartments. Use a small brush or cotton swabs to clean out the individual openings and tubes. Wipe down the entire area with a damp cloth. Make sure all the sticky gunk is gone so your detergents dispense properly. This helps prevent odors and ensures your clothes get the right amount of cleaning agents.

#### Running a Tub Clean Cycle

Most Maytag front-loaders have a "Tub Clean," "Clean Washer," or "Sanitize" cycle. This cycle uses hot water to clean the inside of the drum. Add your cleaning agent directly to the detergent dispenser or the main wash tub. I prefer using two cups of white vinegar for a natural approach. If using a cleaner designed for washing machines, follow its instructions. Some people use 1/2 cup of bleach for sanitization, but avoid using it with vinegar.

Start the Tub Clean cycle. Let the machine complete the cycle without any laundry inside. This cycle gets hot and helps loosen and flush away internal buildup. After the cycle finishes, wipe down the inside of the drum with a clean cloth to remove any remaining residue. Leaving the door ajar after each use helps prevent moisture buildup and keeps the drum fresh. This step is crucial for overall hygiene.

#### Checking the Drain Pump Filter

Many Maytag front-loaders have a drain pump filter, usually located at the bottom front of the machine. This filter catches lint, coins, and other small items before they can clog the drain pump. It needs regular cleaning. Consult your Maytag manual for the exact location and removal instructions. I was surprised by how much lint I found the first time I cleaned mine.

Place a shallow pan or towel underneath the filter access door to catch any water. Twist the filter counter-clockwise to remove it. You will find trapped debris and possibly some stagnant water. Clean the filter under running water with a brush. Check the filter housing for anything trapped inside and remove it. Once clean, replace the filter by twisting it clockwise until secure. Cleaning this filter improves drainage and prevents foul odors. Neglecting it can lead to drain issues and machine error codes.

### Cleaning Your Maytag Top-Load Washing Machine

Maytag top-load washers, especially those with an agitator, are known for their durability and cleaning power. While they do not have the same gasket issues as front-loaders, they can still suffer from detergent buildup, odors, and "scrud." I have cleaned many top-loaders, and the process is straightforward once you know the key areas. This section focuses on how to [clean a Maytag top-load washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-maytag-top-load-washer).

#### Running a Self-Clean Cycle

Just like front-loaders, most modern Maytag top-load washing machines have a "Clean Washer" or "Affresh" cycle. If your machine lacks this cycle, you can run a regular hot water wash cycle on the largest load setting. I typically use two cups of white vinegar for this step. Pour the vinegar directly into the drum. Alternatively, you can use a washing machine cleaner tablet, placing it in the drum according to the product instructions.

Start the hot water cycle. Let the machine fill completely. Once filled and agitated for a few minutes, pause the cycle (if your machine allows it). Let the vinegar solution soak in the tub for about 30 minutes to an hour. This soak time helps break down stubborn grime and mineral deposits. After the soak, resume the cycle and let it complete. This deep cleaning helps flush out internal residues and kill odor-causing bacteria. I always follow this with a quick wipe of the tub. For more general guidance on top-loader cleaning, see our guide on [how to clean a washing machine top-loader](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-top-loader).

#### Cleaning the Detergent Dispenser

Top-load washers have various types of dispensers. Some have removable trays, while others have built-in compartments. Regardless of the type, these areas can accumulate sticky detergent and fabric softener residue. This buildup can impede proper dispensing and contribute to odors. If your dispenser tray is removable, take it out and soak it in warm, soapy water. Use a small brush or old toothbrush to scrub away the gunk. Rinse it thoroughly and dry it before returning it to the machine.

For non-removable dispensers, a spray bottle filled with white vinegar works wonders. Spray inside the compartments. Use a toothbrush or cotton swabs to clean out any visible residue. Wipe the area clean with a damp cloth. It is surprising how much gunk can hide in these small spaces. Keeping the dispenser clean ensures your detergent reaches your clothes properly, improving wash results. This also helps in preventing clogs in the softener lines. If you need more specific help, our article on [how to clean the softener dispenser in a washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-softener-dispenser-in-washing-machine) offers additional advice.

#### Addressing the Agitator Area

Many Maytag top-loaders feature a central agitator that helps move clothes through the wash cycle. Over time, residue can build up around the base of the agitator and underneath it. While the agitator itself is usually not removable for cleaning, you can still address the area around it. After running the self-clean cycle, use a microfiber cloth to wipe down the agitator thoroughly. Pay attention to any grooves or ridges where gunk might accumulate.

If you notice excessive buildup or mold around the agitator, you can create a paste of baking soda and a little water. Apply this paste to the affected areas and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Then, scrub with a brush and wipe clean. This helps remove stubborn grime. For more insights on this specific component, read our guide on [how to clean an agitator in a washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-agitator-in-washing-machine). Ensuring the agitator area is clean helps prevent redeposition of dirt onto clothes and maintains the machine's efficiency.

### Tackling Stubborn Issues: Mold, Mildew, and Scrud

Sometimes, a regular cleaning cycle is not enough. Stubborn issues like mold, mildew, and "scrud" can plague your Maytag washing machine. These problems not only cause bad smells but can also leave marks on your freshly washed clothes. I have dealt with these issues myself, and with the right approach, they are fixable.

#### Eliminating Mold and Mildew

Mold and mildew thrive in damp, dark environments. The rubber gasket in front-loaders is a prime spot for this growth. You will see black spots or feel slimy residue. To tackle severe mold, you might need a stronger solution than just vinegar. I recommend using bleach carefully. Mix 1/2 cup of liquid chlorine bleach with 1 gallon of water. Dip a cloth in this solution and thoroughly wipe down all affected areas, especially inside the gasket folds. For truly bad mold, let the bleach solution sit on the spots for 10-15 minutes before wiping. Always wear gloves and ensure good ventilation.

After cleaning with bleach, run a hot water cycle (without clothes) to rinse away any bleach residue. This helps flush out dead mold spores from the machine's internal parts. For general mold prevention, leaving the washer door ajar after each use is key. This allows air to circulate and the interior to dry. For more comprehensive information on eliminating mold, refer to our detailed article on [how to clean mold from a washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-washing machine). This proactive step prevents significant future headaches.

#### Removing Scrud Buildup

"Scrud" is that gray, greasy, waxy residue that sometimes appears in washing machines. It comes from a combination of fabric softener, detergent, and body oils, especially in machines using cold water or too much detergent. Scrud is tough to remove with just a regular wash. I once had a client whose clothes kept coming out with gray streaks, and scrud was the culprit.

To remove scrud from your Maytag, you need hot water and a strong cleaning agent. I recommend running an empty, extra-hot water cycle with either a specialized washing machine cleaner designed to remove scrud or a generous amount of white vinegar (2-4 cups). Some people have success with a cup of dishwasher detergent (not dish soap) in the drum, as it is formulated to cut through grease. Pause the cycle after it fills and agitates, letting the solution soak for a few hours or even overnight if the scrud is severe.

After the soak, let the cycle complete. You may need to run a second rinse cycle or even another empty hot wash to ensure all the scrud and cleaning agent are flushed out. You might also need to manually wipe down the tub interior after the cycle, as some loosened scrud can stick to the sides. For a deeper dive into this issue, our guide on [how to clean scrud from a washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-scrud-from-washing-machine) provides more specific strategies. Preventing scrud involves using less detergent, avoiding too much fabric softener, and running hot water washes occasionally.

### Maintaining Your Maytag Washer: Best Practices

Cleaning your Maytag washing machine regularly is good, but consistent maintenance practices are even better. These habits help prevent the buildup of odors, mold, and residue. I have adopted these practices over the years, and they make a big difference in keeping my Maytag running smoothly and smelling fresh. They save me time and effort in the long run.

#### Use the Right Detergent and Amount

Using the correct type and amount of detergent is crucial. High-efficiency (HE) Maytag washers require HE detergents, which produce fewer suds. Too many suds create residue that clings to the machine's interior. My clothes felt stiff until I realized I was using too much detergent. Always read your detergent's label and use only the recommended amount, or even slightly less if you have soft water. More detergent does not mean cleaner clothes; it often means more residue. Overdosing detergent is a common cause of internal buildup and odors.

Liquid fabric softener is another major contributor to residue and scrud. Consider using dryer sheets instead, or dilute liquid fabric softener with water before adding it to the dispenser. If you use pods or pacs, place them directly in the drum, not the dispenser. This prevents them from dissolving improperly in the dispenser area. Being mindful of your cleaning agents goes a long way in preventing future cleaning headaches. You can also explore options like [cleaning your washing machine with baking soda and vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-with-baking-soda-and-vinegar) for a gentle, effective alternative.

#### Air Out Your Washer

Moisture trapped inside the washing machine is the primary cause of mold and mildew growth. After every load, I make it a habit to leave the door or lid ajar for a few hours. This allows air to circulate inside the drum and helps it dry completely. For front-loaders, also pull back the door gasket slightly to allow it to dry. This simple step prevents musty odors from forming. It is especially important in humid environments.

If you have young children or pets, ensure the door is securely latched or blocked if left ajar, for safety reasons. You can also wipe down the drum and gasket with a dry cloth after each use. This extra step removes any residual moisture. Consistent air circulation makes a significant impact on maintaining a fresh-smelling Maytag. I wish I had started doing this sooner, it makes a huge difference.

#### Clean Removable Parts Regularly

Beyond the main tub, several parts of your Maytag washing machine are removable and should be cleaned often. This includes the detergent dispenser drawer (if removable) and the drain pump filter (on front-loaders). On some top-loaders, the fabric softener dispenser cup might also be removable. I clean these parts once a month during my routine deep clean.

Removing these parts allows you to scrub away accumulated gunk that a self-clean cycle cannot reach. Soaking them in warm, soapy water or a vinegar solution works well. Use a small brush to get into crevices. Cleaning these components prevents blockages and ensures your machine operates efficiently. It also eliminates hidden sources of odor. A clean washer means truly clean laundry.

### When to Call a Professional

While regular cleaning and maintenance can resolve most common Maytag washing machine issues, there are times when you need professional help. Knowing when to call a technician can save you frustration and prevent further damage to your appliance. I learned this the hard way with a dryer issue that needed expert attention.

If your Maytag washing machine has persistent foul odors even after thorough cleaning, it might indicate a deeper problem. This could be a clog in the drain pump that you cannot access or a mold infestation in areas beyond your reach. Sometimes, mold can grow in the internal hoses or the drain pump housing. A professional appliance technician has specialized tools and knowledge to diagnose and resolve these hidden issues. They can perform a deeper clean or replace affected parts.

You should also contact a professional if you notice mechanical problems after cleaning. This includes unusual noises, leaks, error codes that do not clear, or if the machine is not draining or spinning properly. While cleaning can sometimes fix minor drainage issues related to a clogged filter, persistent problems usually point to a component failure. Trying to fix complex mechanical issues yourself can void your warranty or cause more damage. It is always better to trust a certified Maytag service technician for such repairs. They ensure the machine is fixed correctly and safely.
