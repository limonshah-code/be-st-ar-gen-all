Your Infinity Game Table requires basic attention for long-term enjoyment. Solving problems often involves simple steps. Begin by checking power connections. Then, restart the device. Update the software regularly. These actions fix many common issues.

### 1. Understanding Common Infinity Game Table Issues

Your Infinity Game Table is a fun device. It offers many digital board games and puzzles. Yet, like any tech, it can have problems. Knowing the common issues helps you fix them faster. I have seen many users get stuck on simple glitches.

The most frequent problems fall into a few groups. Power problems are common. The table might not turn on, or it might shut off without warning. Screen issues also happen. The touchscreen might not respond, or the display might show weird colors. Game-related problems are another big area. Games might freeze, load slowly, or crash often. Connectivity issues, like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, can also stop you from playing online or using accessories.

These problems often have easy fixes. Sometimes, a quick restart is all you need. Other times, you may need to check cables or update software. Do not rush to think your table is broken. Most issues are minor. We will explore each type of problem. We will give you steps to fix them. You can get back to gaming quickly.

My own experience shows that a calm approach works best. When my table acts up, I start with the basics. I check the power. I restart it. Then I look deeper. This way, I avoid bigger headaches.

### 2. Power and Connectivity Problems

Power issues are a major pain. If your Infinity Game Table will not turn on, start here. First, check the power cord. Make sure it is plugged firmly into the table and the wall outlet. Sometimes, the cord can come loose. Try a different power outlet if you can. This checks if the outlet itself has power. I once spent an hour trying to fix a device, only to find the power strip was off.

If the table still does not turn on, check the power adapter. Look for any damage to the cord or adapter box. A damaged adapter cannot deliver power. If you have another compatible adapter, try using it. This helps rule out the adapter as the problem. Remember, these tables need steady power.

Wi-Fi problems also stop fun. The table needs a strong Wi-Fi signal to download games and play online. First, restart your Wi-Fi router. Unplug it for 30 seconds, then plug it back in. This often clears network glitches. Then, go to your table’s settings. Check if Wi-Fi is on. Make sure you connect to the right network. Enter your password carefully.

If Wi-Fi still acts up, move the table closer to your router. Walls and other devices can block signals. Try disconnecting other devices from your Wi-Fi temporarily. This gives the table more bandwidth. Bluetooth connectivity issues are similar. Make sure Bluetooth is on in settings. Check that the accessory you want to connect is in pairing mode. My own table sometimes struggles with Bluetooth headphones if too many other devices are active. If you are having issues with other home devices, checking out general troubleshooting tips like those for a [Moultrie Game Camera Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/moultrie-game-camera-troubleshooting) or a [Carrier Infinity Thermostat Troubleshooting Manual](https://beacleaner.com/carrier-infinity-thermostat-troubleshooting-manual) can provide helpful context on systematic problem-solving.

### 3. Touchscreen and Display Troubles

An unresponsive touchscreen stops all gameplay. If your screen does not respond to touch, try these steps. First, clean the screen surface. Dust, fingerprints, or spills can block touch input. Use a soft, lint-free cloth. Do not use harsh chemicals. A slightly damp cloth with water is best for [cleaning a glass table top](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-glass-table-top), and this applies to the Infinity Game Table screen too. Make sure the screen is dry before you try using it again.

If cleaning does not help, restart the table. This often resets the touchscreen sensors. Hold down the power button until the table shuts off. Wait a few seconds, then turn it back on. Many times, this simple step fixes frozen touchscreens. I have found this works for most digital devices.

Display problems also ruin the fun. You might see a black screen, distorted colors, or flickering. First, check all cables if your model has external display ports. Make sure they are secure. If the screen is completely black but you hear sound, the display might be off or faulty. Try adjusting the brightness settings if you can. Sometimes, the brightness gets turned down too low by accident.

A factory reset might be needed if display issues continue. This should be a last resort for screen problems. A factory reset wipes all data and settings. Back up any important game saves if possible. I always try all other steps before resetting my devices. If your screen still acts up, the hardware might be faulty. Then, you may need to contact support. You can apply similar logic used for other devices like those in [U by Moen Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/u-by-moen-troubleshooting) for diagnosing general display issues.

### 4. Game Loading and Performance Glitches

When games will not load or run slowly, it is frustrating. Your Infinity Game Table should offer smooth gameplay. If a game freezes or crashes often, start by restarting the table. This clears the table's memory and can fix temporary glitches. I often find this simple step solves many game-related issues.

Next, check your internet connection. Many games need a stable connection to download updates or access online features. If your Wi-Fi is weak, games might struggle to load. Try moving closer to your router or restarting your router, as discussed earlier. A slow internet speed can make game downloads take forever.

Sometimes, the game itself might have a problem. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the problematic game. Go to the table's game library or app store. Find the game. Choose the option to uninstall. Then, download and install it again. This process can fix corrupted game files. Make sure you have enough storage space on your table. If the storage is full, games cannot install or run properly. Delete old games you no longer play.

Performance issues, like slow frame rates or lag, often relate to software. Ensure your table's system software is up to date. Updates often include performance improvements and bug fixes. We will talk more about updates in the next section. Overheating can also cause performance drops. Make sure the table has good airflow around it. Do not block vents. I make sure my table is in an open area to prevent it from getting too hot.

If you are dealing with other types of device performance problems, looking at resources like [Whirlpool 2-in-1 Washer Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/whirlpool-2-in-1-washer-troubleshooting) can sometimes offer different perspectives on general hardware and software interactions.

### 5. Software Updates and System Maintenance

Keeping your Infinity Game Table software updated is very important. Updates bring new features, improve performance, and fix bugs. Ignoring updates can lead to more problems over time. Your table might run slower or have more glitches. I always install updates as soon as they are available. It saves me trouble later.

To check for updates, go to your table’s system settings. Look for an "About" or "System Update" section. The table will then check for new software. If an update is ready, follow the on-screen instructions to install it. Make sure your table is connected to Wi-Fi during this process. A power cut during an update can damage the system. It is best to do updates when the table is fully charged or plugged in.

Sometimes, a software problem is too deep for a simple restart. In these cases, a factory reset might be your best option. A factory reset returns your table to its original state. It deletes all games, settings, and personal data. This can fix many software-related problems. Only do a factory reset after trying all other steps.

To perform a factory reset, go to system settings. Look for "Backup & Reset" or "Factory Data Reset." You will get a warning message. Read it carefully. Confirm you want to proceed. The table will restart and erase all data. This process can take some time. After the reset, you will set up your table again, just like when it was new. I always make a note of my favorite games before doing a reset.

Basic cleaning is also part of maintenance. Keep the screen and surrounding area clean. Dust can get into ports and affect performance. For example, cleaning a [table fan](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-table-fan) helps it run better by removing dust from its components. Similarly, a soft, dry cloth is good for the table's surface. Avoid abrasive cleaners. This care helps your table last longer.

### 6. Audio and Accessory Connection Failures

Sound problems can take away from the game experience. If you have no sound or distorted audio from your Infinity Game Table, first check the volume. Make sure it is not turned all the way down or muted. Look for volume buttons on the table itself. Also, check the sound settings in the system menu. Sometimes, the audio output might be set to an external device that is not connected.

If you are using external speakers or headphones, check their connections. Make sure cables are plugged in tightly. If using Bluetooth audio, ensure the device is paired correctly and charged. Try unpairing and re-pairing the Bluetooth device. This often fixes connection glitches. I had a similar issue with a different device, and simply re-pairing my headphones solved it.

Accessory connection problems often involve Bluetooth. The Infinity Game Table supports various Bluetooth accessories, like controllers. If your accessory will not connect, first make sure it is fully charged. Then, put the accessory into pairing mode. Each device has a specific way to do this. Check its manual. On your table, go to Bluetooth settings. Search for new devices. Select your accessory when it appears.

If an accessory previously worked but now does not, try removing it from your table's paired device list. Then, try to pair it again as a new device. This helps clear old connection data that might be causing issues. Sometimes, the accessory itself might have a problem. Try connecting the accessory to a different device, like a phone or computer. If it works there, the issue is with your table. If it does not, the accessory might be broken.

Always make sure the table’s software is updated. Updates can improve accessory compatibility. If you are troubleshooting a range of home items, you might find similar steps for various tech, such as [toilet troubleshooting a fill valve](https://beacleaner.com/toilet-troubleshooting-fill-valve) which also relies on checking connections and components.

### 7. Advanced Troubleshooting and Support Options

When simple steps do not fix your Infinity Game Table, you might need more advanced help. These problems often point to deeper software issues or hardware failure. It is important to know when to seek professional support. Do not try to open the table yourself. This can void your warranty.

First, consider a full system restore if you have not already. We discussed the factory reset in a previous section. This is a drastic step, but it often solves stubborn software problems. Remember, it will erase everything. Ensure you have backed up any data you want to keep, if possible. My advice is to only do this if all other software fixes fail.

If the problem still exists after a factory reset, it is likely a hardware issue. This means a part inside the table might be broken. Common hardware issues include a faulty power supply, a broken touchscreen digitizer, or a bad internal component. These require specialized repair.

This is the point where you should contact the manufacturer's customer support. Look for the support contact information on their official website. Have your table's serial number ready. This number is usually on the back or bottom of the table. Explain your problem clearly. Tell them all the steps you have already tried. This helps them diagnose the issue faster.

Check your table's warranty status. Most tables come with a one-year warranty. If your table is still under warranty, repairs might be free. Even if it is not, the support team can often guide you to authorized repair centers. Sometimes, they offer paid repair services. Getting help from the experts is the best path for hardware problems.
