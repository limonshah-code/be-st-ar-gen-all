## How To Clean Hair Clippers: A Comprehensive Guide

Maintaining your grooming tools is important. Hair clippers collect hair, skin, and oil after each use. This buildup affects how well they work. A dirty clipper cuts hair poorly and can even pull hairs. Cleaning hair clippers regularly keeps them sharp and extends their life. It also helps prevent skin irritation or infections for you or your clients. This article tells you exactly how to clean your hair clippers. We cover everything from quick daily wipes to deep cleaning and oiling.

### Takeaway:
*   Always unplug clippers before cleaning.
*   Brush away loose hair after every use.
*   Disinfect blades to kill germs.
*   Oil blades regularly to keep them moving smoothly.
*   Store clippers in a dry place.

To clean hair clippers, first unplug the device. Then, use a small brush to remove loose hair from the blades. Disassemble the blades if your model allows. Wash metal blades with disinfectant or soapy water, rinse, and dry completely. Finally, reassemble and apply a few drops of clipper oil to the blades for smooth operation.

### Why Regular Hair Clipper Cleaning Matters for Performance

Keeping your hair clippers clean offers many benefits. A clean clipper performs better. It cuts hair smoothly without snagging or pulling. Dirt and hair buildup make blades dull over time. This makes your grooming routine difficult and less effective.

Dirty clippers also pose hygiene risks. Bacteria and fungi can grow on uncleaned blades. Using these clippers can transfer germs to your skin. This may cause irritation, rashes, or even infections. Proper cleaning prevents these issues. It ensures a safe and comfortable experience every time you cut hair. I always make sure my clippers are spotless before and after use.

Clean clippers simply last longer. Hair and debris create friction between the moving parts. This friction causes wear and tear on the motor and blades. Regular cleaning removes this abrasive material. It helps maintain the integrity of your clippers. This saves you money by delaying the need for new equipment.

#### Benefits of Clean Clippers

Clean clippers provide a sharp, precise cut. They glide through hair effortlessly. This prevents painful tugging or uneven trims. You get a better haircut every time. A clean tool also feels good to use.

Clean clippers are more hygienic. They reduce the risk of skin irritation or infections. This is especially important if you share clippers or use them on multiple people. Disinfecting blades kills harmful microorganisms. This ensures safe use for everyone. Just like you clean your hair combs, your clippers need attention too.

#### Risks of Dirty Clippers

Dirty clippers can cause skin problems. Folliculitis, a common infection, can occur from unclean blades. This infection appears as small red bumps around hair follicles. It can be itchy and uncomfortable. Unclean clippers transfer bacteria easily.

Blunt blades are another risk of dirty clippers. Hair and debris stick to the blade edges. This dulls them faster than normal use would. Dull blades do not cut cleanly. They pull and snag hair instead. This makes hair cutting painful and inefficient. Regular cleaning maintains blade sharpness.

### Essential Tools and Supplies for Cleaning Hair Clippers

You need specific items to clean your hair clippers effectively. Having the right tools makes the job easier. It also ensures you clean your clippers thoroughly. You likely have most of these items already at home. Gather everything before you start cleaning.

These tools include small brushes, disinfectant sprays, and clipper oil. You also need a soft cloth and sometimes a small screwdriver. Using the correct supplies protects your clippers. It also keeps them running smoothly for many years. I always keep my cleaning kit ready.

Always read your clipper's instruction manual first. Some clippers have special cleaning needs. The manufacturer might suggest specific products. Following their guidelines helps maintain your warranty. It also ensures you clean the clippers correctly.

#### Must-Have Cleaning Gear

First, you need a small cleaning brush. Most clippers come with one. This brush removes loose hair from the blades. If you do not have one, an old toothbrush works well. A soft, dry cloth is also essential for wiping down parts.

Next, get some specialized clipper cleaning spray or disinfectant. Many brands make products for this purpose. These sprays clean and sanitize the blades. Clipper oil is critical for lubrication. Do not use regular household oils; they can gum up the blades. Finally, a small Phillips-head screwdriver may be useful for removing blades on some models.

#### Choosing the Right Disinfectant

Selecting a good disinfectant is very important. You need a product designed for metal tools. Isopropyl alcohol is a common choice. It kills many germs and evaporates quickly. You can buy it in spray bottles or wipes. Many barbers use specialized barbercide solutions.

Always check the label for directions. Some disinfectants need to sit on the blades for a certain time. This ensures they kill all germs effectively. Make sure the disinfectant is safe for your clipper's materials. Never use harsh chemicals like bleach. They can corrode your clipper blades.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Basic Hair Clipper Cleaning

Start with basic cleaning after every use. This simple step prevents buildup. It keeps your clippers ready for the next trim. A quick clean takes only a few minutes. It extends the life of your blades significantly.

First, unplug your clippers from power. Safety is always number one. Then, remove any clipper guards. These guards collect hair too and need separate cleaning. You can wash them with soap and water. Ensure they are dry before putting them back.

Use the small cleaning brush to remove all loose hair. Brush away from the blades, towards the front. Pay attention to the space between the teeth. Hair gets stuck there easily. Wipe the entire clipper body with a dry cloth. This removes dust and skin particles.

#### Daily Quick Clean

After each haircut, do a quick clean. This prevents hair from getting compacted. First, unplug the clipper. This simple step is vital for safety. Then, hold the clipper with blades facing down. Use the small brush provided with your clippers.

Brush away all visible hair from the blades. Make sure to get hair from between the teeth. You can also tap the clipper gently on a hard surface. This helps dislodge any stubborn hair. Finish by wiping the clipper housing with a dry cloth. This quick action makes a big difference.

#### Weekly Thorough Clean

A weekly thorough clean goes deeper. This is important for hygiene and performance. Begin by repeating the daily quick clean steps. Remove all loose hair from the blades and body. For a deeper clean, consider cleaning other hair tools too. [Learn how to clean plastic hair brushes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-plastic-hair-brushes) for related advice.

Next, apply a disinfectant spray to the blades. Follow the product's instructions for contact time. Most sprays need a minute or two. Wipe off the disinfectant with a clean, dry cloth. After this, apply a few drops of clipper oil to the blades. Run the clippers for a few seconds to distribute the oil. This routine keeps your clippers in top shape.

### Deep Cleaning Hair Clipper Blades: A Detailed Process

Deep cleaning your clipper blades ensures maximum hygiene and performance. This process involves detaching the blades from the clipper body. It allows you to clean every nook and cranny. This method is crucial if you use your clippers frequently or professionally. I deep clean my clippers monthly.

Deep cleaning removes unseen debris and old oil. It prevents rust and maintains blade sharpness. It might seem complicated at first. But with practice, it becomes easy. Always refer to your clipper's manual before starting. Some models have specific blade removal methods.

After deep cleaning, reassembling the blades correctly is vital. Misaligned blades can pull hair or cut unevenly. Take your time during reassembly. Ensure all screws are tight but not overtightened. Proper alignment guarantees optimal cutting performance.

#### Detaching Clipper Blades

Most hair clippers allow blade removal. First, unplug your clippers completely. This is a non-negotiable safety step. Look for small screws on the blade assembly. Usually, there are two screws. Use a small screwdriver to loosen them.

Carefully lift the stationary blade and then the cutting blade. Some clippers have a lever to release the blades. Follow your specific model's instructions. Keep track of all screws and parts. Placing them in a small bowl prevents loss. Remember the orientation of the blades for reassembly.

#### Cleaning Blades Properly

Once the blades are detached, clean them thoroughly. Use the cleaning brush to remove all hair. You might be surprised how much hair accumulates under the blades. For metal blades, you can wash them with warm, soapy water. Use a mild dish soap. Scrub gently with a small brush.

Rinse the blades completely under running water. Ensure no soap residue remains. For a more intensive clean, soak the blades in a specialized clipper cleaning solution. Some people use hydrogen peroxide for cleaning their hair tools. [Discover how to clean hair brushes with hydrogen peroxide](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hair-brushes-with-hydrogen-peroxide) for more options. After soaking, wipe them clean.

#### Drying and Reattaching Blades

Drying the blades completely is the most crucial step. Any moisture left on the blades can cause rust. Rust will ruin your blades quickly. Use a clean, dry cloth to pat the blades dry. You can also let them air dry for several hours. Ensure they are bone-dry before reassembly.

Once dry, reattach the blades to the clipper body. Align the stationary blade first, then the moving blade. Make sure they fit perfectly. Tighten the screws carefully. Do not overtighten, as this can strip the screws or damage the clipper. Your clipper blades should move smoothly by hand after reassembly.

### Disinfecting and Sanitizing Your Hair Clippers

Disinfecting your hair clippers is not optional. It is a critical step for hygiene. Cleaning removes dirt and hair. Disinfecting kills germs like bacteria, viruses, and fungi. This protects both you and anyone else using the clippers. I always prioritize sanitizing my tools.

Regular disinfection is especially important in professional settings. Barbers and stylists must follow strict sanitation protocols. But even for home use, it makes sense. A quick disinfection after each use prevents the spread of skin issues. It gives you peace of mind.

There are different methods for disinfecting clippers. Choose a method that works for your clipper type. Always read the product instructions. Proper disinfection ensures your tools are safe. It also extends their lifespan by preventing corrosion from microbial activity.

#### Why Disinfect is Important

Disinfection stops germ transfer. Hair clippers touch skin and hair directly. This means they can pick up various microorganisms. Using un-disinfected clippers can spread skin infections. These include ringworm, staph infections, and folliculitis. It is a simple health safeguard.

Dirty clippers can also cause skin irritation. Even without a full-blown infection, bacterial buildup causes issues. Tiny bumps, redness, or itching can occur. Disinfecting removes these irritants. It makes your grooming experience much more pleasant and safer.

#### Best Disinfection Methods

The most common disinfectant is isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol). Use a concentration of 70% or higher. You can spray it directly onto the blades after cleaning them. Let it sit for a minute or two. Then, wipe it dry with a clean cloth. This method is effective and evaporates quickly.

Specialized clipper disinfectants are also available. These products are often "barbicide" solutions. They are designed specifically for grooming tools. Follow the product's directions carefully. Some may require soaking the blades. Others are sprays. Always ensure your clippers are unplugged and blades are dry before applying any liquid disinfectant.

### Oiling and Maintaining Hair Clipper Blades for Longevity

Oiling your hair clipper blades is as important as cleaning them. Clean blades need proper lubrication to function smoothly. Oil reduces friction between the moving and stationary blades. This prevents overheating and excessive wear. It also keeps your clippers quieter. I make sure to oil mine after every deep clean.

Lack of oil makes blades drag and pull hair. It can also cause the motor to work harder. This shortens the clipper's life. Regular oiling maintains blade sharpness. It also prevents rust by creating a protective barrier. Use only specialized clipper oil. Do not use household oils, as they can damage your clippers.

Think of clipper oil as essential for the machine's health. Just like a car needs oil, your clippers need it too. This simple step saves you money in the long run. It prevents costly repairs or replacements. It ensures your clippers always perform at their best.

#### The Importance of Lubrication

Proper lubrication keeps your clipper blades cool. Friction between the blades creates heat. Too much heat damages the metal and dulls the cutting edges. Oil acts as a coolant, absorbing and dissipating this heat. This extends the life of your blades significantly.

Oil also protects against rust. Blades are often made of steel. Steel can rust when exposed to moisture. Clipper oil forms a thin protective layer on the metal. This barrier prevents oxidation and corrosion. Regular oiling is a vital part of clipper care.

#### Proper Oiling Technique

After cleaning and drying your blades, apply oil. Turn the clipper on its side. Place two or three drops of clipper oil across the top of the blades. Spread a drop on each corner of the blade. Then, put one drop in the center.

Turn the clipper on for about 10-15 seconds. This allows the oil to spread evenly across the blades. You will see excess oil come out. Wipe off this excess oil with a clean cloth. Too much oil can attract more hair and dust. Repeat this process after every few uses or once a week.

### Troubleshooting Common Hair Clipper Cleaning Challenges

Sometimes, even with regular cleaning, you might face issues. Stubborn buildup or rust can appear. These problems require specific solutions. Do not worry; most challenges are fixable. Knowing how to address them saves your clippers. I have dealt with these issues many times.

Addressing these issues promptly prevents further damage. Ignoring them can lead to irreparable harm to your clipper. A little extra effort now saves you from buying new equipment later. This section helps you tackle those trickier cleaning scenarios. Remember, patience is key.

If your clippers are struggling, check their cleanliness first. Often, performance issues stem from dirt or lack of oil. Before assuming a mechanical fault, ensure they are perfectly clean and lubricated. This simple check solves most problems.

#### Dealing with Rust Spots

Rust is a clipper's enemy. It damages blades and affects cutting. If you spot minor rust, you might be able to remove it. First, detach the blades as described earlier. Use a rust remover designed for metal. Apply it with a small brush or cloth. Follow product instructions carefully.

For light rust, a paste of baking soda and water can help. Apply it to the rust spots. Let it sit for a few minutes. Gently scrub with an old toothbrush. Then rinse thoroughly and dry completely. This method is effective for minor surface rust. Remember, rust prevention is better than removal. Always ensure blades are dry before storage.

#### Removing Stubborn Buildup

Sometimes, hair and oil can combine to form stubborn grime. This buildup resists simple brushing. For these areas, a stronger cleaning agent is needed. After detaching the blades, soak them in a mixture of rubbing alcohol and a few drops of dish soap. Let them soak for 15-20 minutes.

Use a stiff-bristled brush or an old toothbrush to scrub the grime away. Pay special attention to the gaps between the teeth. Rinse the blades under warm water. Ensure all residue is gone. Dry them thoroughly before reassembling and oiling. This deep soak breaks down stubborn deposits. It restores your blades to pristine condition.

#### When to Replace Blades

Even with the best care, blades wear out. If your clippers pull hair consistently, even after cleaning and oiling, blades might be dull. If you see nicks or damage on the blade teeth, replacement is needed. Dull blades cause uneven cuts and irritation.

Rust that cannot be removed also means it is time for new blades. Extensive rust weakens the metal and affects performance. Check your clipper's manual for replacement blade models. Replacing blades is cheaper than buying a whole new clipper. It brings your clippers back to full cutting power.

### FAQ Section

#### How often should I clean my hair clippers?
You should brush away loose hair after every use. Perform a thorough cleaning and disinfection weekly for home use. If you use clippers professionally, clean and disinfect them after every client. Oiling blades every few uses or weekly ensures smooth operation and prevents rust.

#### Can I use water to clean my hair clippers?
Some modern clippers are "washable" or "waterproof," meaning you can rinse the blades under running water. Always check your clipper's manual first. If not specified as waterproof, avoid getting the motor housing wet. For non-waterproof clippers, only use brushes and dry cloths, or detach blades for washing.
