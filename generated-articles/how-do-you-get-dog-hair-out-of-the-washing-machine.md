## Removing Dog Hair from Your Washing Machine

As a pet owner, I know the joy our furry friends bring. They fill our homes with love, laughter, and sometimes, a lot of hair. This hair often finds its way into our clothes, blankets, and eventually, our washing machine. Getting dog hair out of the washing machine can feel like a never-ending battle.

Dog hair collects inside the drum, on the agitator, and in the filter, making it hard to get rid of completely. This build-up reduces cleaning effectiveness and can even clog your machine. This article will show you simple ways to remove dog hair from your washing machine. We will cover pre-wash steps, in-wash solutions, and thorough cleaning methods. Keep your laundry and your machine hair-free.

### Takeaway

*   Pre-treat items to remove most hair before washing.
*   Use in-wash solutions like pet hair removers or dryer sheets.
*   Clean the washing machine thoroughly after washing pet items.
*   Regular maintenance prevents hair build-up and keeps your machine working well.

You get dog hair out of the washing machine by first shaking or vacuuming items before washing. Then, use a damp cloth or dryer sheet to wipe the inside of the drum after each cycle. Regularly clean the lint trap and run a machine cleaning cycle with hot water and vinegar. This removes lingering hair and keeps your appliance clean.

## Understanding Dog Hair in Your Washing Machine

Dog hair is light and static. It clings to fabric easily. When you wash items with pet hair, the water often makes the hair stick more. This hair then transfers to other clothes or remains inside the washing machine drum. It does not always wash away cleanly with the water.

This issue is common for many pet owners. Hair can clog the drain pump filter over time. It can also build up on the drum's surfaces. This makes your clothes come out with more hair than they went in with. Understanding how hair behaves in water helps you fight the problem effectively. You must use specific methods to break the bond between hair and fabric. You also need to trap the hair for removal.

### Why Hair Sticks

Dog hair is very fine. It has a barbed texture. This texture helps it grip onto fabric fibers. When wet, the hair clumps together. It becomes heavy and sinks. It often settles in the lowest parts of the washing machine. Lint traps are designed to catch some debris, but pet hair often bypasses them. It can stick to the sides of the drum. It can also get into the machine's internal components. This creates a challenging cleaning task.

Static electricity also plays a part. Dryer sheets help reduce static in the dryer. However, during the wash cycle, water and agitation can generate static. This makes hair cling to surfaces. Using specific products or techniques helps counter this issue. You need to release the hair from fabrics. Then, you need to collect it before it sticks again.

### Common Problems Caused by Hair Build-Up

Hair build-up causes several problems. First, your clothes may still have pet hair after washing. This means you need to re-wash them or use lint rollers. Second, significant hair accumulation can block your washing machine's drain. This leads to poor draining or machine errors. This can lead to expensive repairs.

Third, hair mixed with detergent residue can create a grime layer. This grime can cause odors inside your machine. It also reduces cleaning efficiency. Your clothes may not smell as fresh. Regular cleaning and preventative steps are crucial. They keep your machine working well. They also keep your clothes truly clean.

## Pre-Washing Steps: Removing Hair Before You Wash

The best way to get dog hair out of your washing machine is to prevent it from entering in the first place. Pre-washing steps are vital. These steps remove a large amount of hair before it even touches the water. This significantly reduces the amount of hair that will stick to your clothes or inside the machine. I always recommend these initial actions.

Think of it as a first line of defense. Taking a few extra minutes here saves a lot of trouble later. This approach is more effective than trying to remove hair once it is wet. Wet hair sticks more stubbornly. It spreads easily to other items in the load.

### Shake and Brush Items

Before putting clothes or pet bedding into the washing machine, shake them vigorously outdoors. This helps dislodge loose hair. Hold the item and give it a good snap. You will see a surprising amount of hair fly off. You can also use a stiff brush or a lint brush to remove hair. Brush in one direction to collect hair into piles.

For thicker items like blankets or pet beds, a pet grooming brush can work wonders. The bristles are designed to pull hair from fabric. Do this outdoors if possible. This prevents hair from spreading inside your home. This simple step removes a large percentage of hair. It prevents it from clumping in the washer.

### Vacuum Large Items

For very hairy items, such as large blankets, pet beds, or car seat covers, a vacuum cleaner is your best friend. Use the upholstery attachment on your vacuum. Go over the surface thoroughly. Vacuuming pulls deeply embedded hair from the fabric. It is especially useful for items that cannot be easily shaken.

This method is highly effective for heavy hair loads. It prepares the item for washing. This means less hair ends up in your washing machine's drain or drum. It is a quick and efficient way to handle large volumes of dog hair. Make sure your vacuum filter is clean for best suction.

### Use a Damp Rubber Glove or Sponge

A simple rubber glove, like those used for dishwashing, is an excellent tool for hair removal. Put on a damp rubber glove. Rub your hand over the fabric. The static electricity and friction will lift the hair. The hair will cling to the glove. You can then rinse the glove under running water to remove the hair. Repeat until most hair is gone.

A damp sponge also works similarly. Wipe the fabric surface with the damp sponge. The hair will stick to the sponge. Rinse the sponge frequently. Both methods are effective for small items or specific spots. They are great for a quick pre-clean before washing.

## During Wash Solutions: Trapping Hair in the Cycle

Even with careful pre-washing, some dog hair will enter the washing machine. Fortunately, specific products and techniques can help trap this hair during the wash cycle. These solutions prevent hair from sticking to other clothes or settling inside the machine. They make the post-wash clean-up much easier. I have found these methods incredibly useful in my own home.

These additions work with your detergent. They help hair release from fabrics. Then, they gather it into manageable clumps. This stops the hair from spreading. It ensures your clothes come out cleaner.

### Add a Hair Catcher or Lint Ball

Several products are designed to catch pet hair during the wash. These often look like small mesh bags or plastic balls with textured surfaces. You simply toss them into the washing machine with your laundry. As the machine agitates, the hair catchers collect loose hair. The hair sticks to their surfaces or gets trapped in their mesh.

After the wash cycle, remove the hair catcher. You will see a significant amount of hair collected on it. Discard the hair. Then, clean the catcher for reuse. These tools are very effective. They prevent hair from redepositing onto your clean clothes. They also stop it from entering the machine's drain filter.

### Use Vinegar in the Rinse Cycle

White vinegar is a powerful, natural cleaning agent. It is excellent for laundry. Adding half a cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle helps loosen pet hair. Vinegar helps relax fabric fibers. This allows trapped hair to release. It also reduces static cling. Hair then rinses away more easily.

Vinegar also helps deodorize clothes and the washing machine. It leaves no strong odor after drying. Simply pour the vinegar into the fabric softener dispenser. Do not mix it directly with bleach, as this can create harmful fumes. This natural solution is gentle on fabrics and effective against pet hair. It also contributes to a [clean washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine) overall.

### Add Dryer Sheets to the Washer

While dryer sheets are mainly for the dryer, some people use them in the washing machine. Adding one or two dryer sheets to the wash cycle can help reduce static. This makes it harder for hair to cling to clothes. It allows hair to rinse away more easily.

This method works best for smaller loads. The sheets need space to move around and interact with the fabrics. Be careful not to use too many, as they can sometimes leave a residue on clothes. This is an alternative if you do not have specific hair catchers. It is also good for a quick fix.

## Post-Washing Machine Cleaning: Getting Rid of Leftover Hair

After washing items with pet hair, it is crucial to clean the washing machine itself. Hair often remains inside the drum, around the seal, and in the filter. Neglecting this step means the hair will transfer to your next load of laundry. It can also lead to unpleasant odors and machine malfunctions. I make sure to do this after every pet laundry load.

This post-wash cleaning is just as important as the pre-wash steps. It ensures your machine stays hygienic and efficient. It also guarantees that your non-pet laundry stays hair-free. A clean machine performs better. It lasts longer.

### Wipe Down the Drum and Door Seal

Immediately after the wash cycle finishes, open the washing machine door. Take a damp cloth or a paper towel. Wipe down the entire inside of the drum. Pay special attention to the bottom and sides. You will likely find wet clumps of hair stuck there.

For front-loading machines, the rubber gasket or door seal is a notorious hair trap. Pull back the folds of the seal. You will find a collection of hair, lint, and sometimes grime. Use your damp cloth to thoroughly clean this area. This area can also harbor mold if not cleaned regularly. [Cleaning mold from your washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-remove-mold-from-a-washing-machine) is vital for machine health.

### Clean the Lint Filter or Drain Pump Filter

Most washing machines have a lint filter or a drain pump filter. These filters trap debris, including hair, to prevent clogs. The location varies by machine type. Top-loaders often have a removable filter inside the agitator or near the top rim of the drum. Front-loaders typically have a small access panel at the bottom front of the machine.

Consult your washing machine's manual to find your specific filter. Twist it open. You will likely find a significant amount of hair and lint. Remove all debris. Rinse the filter under running water. Replace it securely. Cleaning this filter is critical for proper drainage. It also prevents clogs. This helps your machine run smoothly. You can learn more about how to [clean the drain in your washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-drain-in-washing-machine) for detailed steps.

### Run a Self-Clean Cycle or Hot Water Wash

After you have manually removed visible hair, run a self-clean cycle. Many modern washing machines have this feature. This cycle uses hot water and high agitation to clean the machine's interior. If your machine does not have a self-clean option, run a hot water wash cycle with no clothes in it.

Add a cup of white vinegar or a washing machine cleaner to this cycle. This helps dislodge any remaining hair or residue. It also sanitizes the machine. This step ensures that invisible hair particles are flushed out. It leaves your machine fresh and ready for the next load. For a deeper clean, consider using specific cleaning agents. You can even [clean your washing machine with bleach](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-washing-machine-with-bleach) if needed.

## Specific Machine Types and Their Hair Challenges

Washing machine designs differ. Each type presents unique challenges when dealing with dog hair. Understanding these differences helps you apply the most effective cleaning methods. Whether you have a front-loader or a top-loader, hair can find its way into specific areas. Knowing where to look makes cleaning much easier.

I have owned both types of machines. My experience shows that while the goal is the same, the methods vary slightly. You need to adjust your approach based on your machine's design. This ensures thorough hair removal.

### Front-Loading Washing Machines

Front-loaders are known for their efficiency. However, they have a common problem area for hair: the rubber gasket. This seal around the door traps water, hair, and lint. It is a prime spot for mold and odor if not cleaned regularly. After every load with pet items, I make sure to wipe this seal.

The drum of a front-loader is usually smoother inside. This means hair is less likely to cling to rough surfaces. However, it can still settle at the bottom of the drum. It can also get into the drain filter. Regularly cleaning the gasket and the drain pump filter is essential for front-loaders. This prevents hair build-up. It also keeps your machine smelling fresh.

### Top-Loading Washing Machines (with and without agitator)

Top-loading machines come in two main types: with an agitator and without.
*   **Top-loaders with an agitator:** The central agitator column can be a magnet for pet hair. Hair often wraps around it during the wash cycle. After washing, check the agitator carefully. Wipe down any hair clinging to it. These machines sometimes have lint filters within the agitator itself. Make sure to remove and clean these filters regularly.
*   **Top-loaders without an agitator (HE machines):** These machines use impeller plates at the bottom of the tub for gentle washing. Hair can settle around these plates or in the tub's crevices. They often have self-cleaning lint filters that collect hair. You need to clean these filters regularly. Hair can also get caught on the outer tub.

For both top-loader types, hair can also float to the surface. It can then redeposit on clothes. Using a hair catcher or a damp rubber glove inside the drum after a cycle helps. This removes any floating hair before it dries and sticks. General tips on how to [clean a GE washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-ge-washing-machine) or other brands often apply.

## Advanced Strategies for Stubborn Hair and Odors

Sometimes, dog hair seems to have truly taken root in your washing machine. Regular cleaning might not be enough. This is when you need to bring in more advanced strategies. These methods target deeply embedded hair and associated odors. They provide a thorough reset for your appliance. I turn to these when the usual steps are not quite enough.

These strategies involve deeper cleaning of the machine's components. They also include specific products or routines. They aim to break down hair and residues completely. This ensures your washing machine is truly clean and odor-free.

### Deep Clean the Drain Pump Filter

While discussed earlier, a *deep* clean of the drain pump filter is often overlooked. This filter can become heavily clogged with hair, lint, and even small objects. If your machine is draining slowly or leaving wet clothes, this filter is often the culprit. I sometimes find years of accumulated gunk here.

To deep clean:
1.  **Locate the filter:** Usually at the bottom front of the machine, behind a small panel.
2.  **Prepare for water:** Place a shallow pan and towels underneath. A small amount of water will likely drain out.
3.  **Unscrew the filter:** Slowly twist the filter counter-clockwise to remove it.
4.  **Remove debris:** Pull out all hair, lint, and any foreign objects. You might need pliers for stubborn hair clumps.
5.  **Rinse thoroughly:** Wash the filter under hot running water. Use an old toothbrush to scrub away any slime or residue.
6.  **Check the housing:** Look inside the filter housing with a flashlight. Remove any remaining hair or debris you see.
7.  **Reinstall:** Screw the filter back in tightly.

This deep cleaning improves drainage significantly. It also removes a major source of lingering hair. It prevents future clogs.

### Use a Washing Machine Cleaner Product

Specialized washing machine cleaner tablets or liquids are very effective. These products contain agents that break down detergent residue, grime, and even pet hair. They are designed to clean the internal components of the machine that you cannot reach. I use these every few months.

Follow the product instructions. Typically, you add the cleaner to an empty machine. Then, you run a hot water cycle. These cleaners help dislodge hair that has accumulated in hidden areas. They also sanitize the machine. This leaves it clean and fresh. They are excellent for maintaining overall machine hygiene. They also help prevent future hair build-up.

### Odor Removal Techniques

Dog hair combined with dampness can cause unpleasant odors in your washing machine.
*   **Vinegar and Baking Soda:** Run an empty hot water cycle with two cups of white vinegar. Stop the cycle mid-way and let it sit for an hour. Then, restart and finish the cycle. Follow this with another empty hot water cycle, this time adding half a cup of baking soda. Baking soda absorbs odors.
*   **Air Dry the Machine:** After every wash, leave the washing machine door open. This allows air to circulate. It dries out the drum and gasket. This prevents moisture from trapping odors. It also prevents mold growth.
*   **Clean Detergent Dispenser:** Hair and residue can build up in the detergent dispenser. Remove the dispenser drawer if possible. Clean it thoroughly with hot, soapy water and a brush. Rinse well before replacing. This prevents clogs and odors.

These steps ensure that your machine not only removes hair but also smells clean. This helps maintain the freshness of your laundry.

## Preventative Measures: Keeping Hair Out in the First Place

Preventing dog hair from entering your washing machine is the most effective strategy. Proactive steps reduce the amount of hair you have to deal with later. These measures save time and effort. They also protect your washing machine from unnecessary wear and tear. I have found these tips make a huge difference in my laundry routine.

These methods focus on managing pet hair at the source. They stop hair from becoming a problem in your laundry. They create a cleaner home environment overall.

### Brush Your Pet Regularly

The simplest and most effective preventative measure is regular pet grooming. Brush your dog daily, especially if they shed a lot. This removes loose hair before it falls off and gets on your clothes. Do this outdoors or in an easy-to-clean area. This reduces the amount of hair floating around your home.

Specific deshedding tools can be very effective for certain breeds. Regular brushing not only helps your laundry but also keeps your pet's coat healthy. It reduces allergens in your home. This simple habit makes a big impact.

### Use Specific Laundry Bags for Pet Items

For items heavily soiled with pet hair, use dedicated mesh laundry bags. Place pet blankets, towels, or small beds inside these bags before washing. The bag contains most of the hair. It prevents it from spreading to other items in the wash. It also stops it from clogging the machine.

After washing, shake out the hair from the bag before putting it in the dryer. You will see a lot of hair trapped inside the bag. This method simplifies cleanup. It protects your washing machine. These bags are durable and reusable.

### Load Size Matters

Overloading your washing machine is a common mistake. A machine that is too full does not agitate clothes properly. This means hair cannot be effectively dislodged or rinsed away. Clothes also do not get truly clean. Give your laundry enough space to move freely. This allows the water and detergent to work effectively. It also helps hair release from fabrics.

Wash items with a lot of pet hair in smaller loads. This gives the hair more space to come loose. It allows it to be caught by the filter or flushed out. This also protects your machine from strain.

### Dry Items First (Briefly)

For items with a lot of hair, consider putting them in the dryer for 10-15 minutes *before* washing. Use a "no heat" or "air fluff" setting. The tumbling action and lint filter in the dryer will remove a surprising amount of loose hair. The heat can sometimes bake the hair onto the fabric, so use a cool setting.

After this pre-dryer cycle, clean out your dryer's lint trap thoroughly. This simple step removes a significant amount of hair. It prevents it from entering your washing machine at all. This is a very effective trick for heavily furred items.

## Dealing with Lingering Hair: Final Touches for Hair-Free Laundry

Even after all the preventative and cleaning steps, some dog hair can still cling to your clothes. This is especially true for certain fabrics or very long hair. These final touches ensure your laundry comes out completely hair-free and fresh. I often use these last steps for perfect results.

These methods are for those stubborn strands that just will not go away. They provide that extra level of cleanliness. They ensure your clothes are ready to wear without a single stray hair.

### Use a Lint Roller or Tape

Once clothes are dry, a good old-fashioned lint roller is invaluable. Roll it over any items that still show signs of hair. The adhesive surface picks up stray hairs quickly and effectively. Keep a lint roller handy near your laundry area.

For larger areas or if you do not have a lint roller, strong packing tape works in a pinch. Wrap the tape around your hand, sticky side out. Pat it onto the fabric to lift hair. Replace the tape as it loses its stickiness. This is a simple, low-tech solution that always works.

### Air Dry When Possible

For items prone to holding onto hair, air drying can be beneficial. The agitation of a dryer can sometimes bake hair onto fabrics. Air drying allows hair to fall off naturally as the fabric dries. Hang items on a clothesline or drying rack. Gravity often does the work of pulling loose hairs downwards.

Once dry, you can shake the item vigorously again. Use a lint roller for any remaining strands. This method is gentle on clothes. It is also energy-efficient. It gives you another chance to remove hair before it sets.

### Shake Out Clothes Before Folding

Before folding or putting away your clean clothes, give each item a good shake. This simple action can dislodge any lingering hairs that might have settled during drying. It is a quick final check to ensure everything is perfectly clean.

This is especially helpful for items like towels or fleece blankets. These materials tend to attract and hold onto pet hair more stubbornly. A quick shake ensures no surprise hairs appear when you wear or use the item. It also fluffs up the fabric.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use a regular vacuum cleaner to remove hair from inside the washing machine?
Yes, you can use a regular vacuum cleaner with an upholstery attachment. Use it to suck up dry hair from the drum and around the door seal. This works best before you run a wash cycle. It removes loose hair that has not yet become wet and sticky. Be careful not to vacuum any wet parts.

### How often should I clean my washing machine for pet hair?
If you frequently wash pet bedding or clothes with a lot of hair, clean your washing machine after every such load. If pet hair is a minor issue, cleaning it once a month is usually sufficient. Regular cleaning prevents build-up and maintains machine efficiency. It also prevents odors.

### Will pet hair damage my washing machine?
Excessive pet hair build-up can damage your washing machine over time. It can clog the drain pump filter, leading to drainage issues. It can also cause the motor to work harder. This reduces the machine's lifespan. Regular hair removal and maintenance prevent these problems.

### What kind of laundry detergent is best for removing pet hair?
