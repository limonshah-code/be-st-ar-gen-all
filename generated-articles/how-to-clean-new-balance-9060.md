Proper care is key to maintaining their original look and feel. This article will show you exactly how to clean New Balance 9060 sneakers. We will cover all the different materials used, from delicate suede to breathable mesh. You will learn about the right tools and step-by-step processes for a thorough cleaning.

**Takeaway:**

### Understanding Your New Balance 9060 Materials

The New Balance 9060 model is known for its distinctive design and comfort. This design often combines several different materials. Knowing these materials helps you clean your shoes correctly and avoid damage. Most 9060s feature a strategic mix of suede, mesh, and synthetic overlays. Each of these materials requires a specific approach during cleaning.

Suede parts are particularly soft and have a unique napped finish. Water and harsh chemicals can easily damage suede, leading to stiffness or discoloration. Mesh sections are lightweight and highly breathable. They are designed for airflow but can also trap dust, dirt, and small debris easily. Synthetic overlays, often made from durable plastics or leathers, provide structure and support to the shoe. These parts are typically more resilient and simpler to clean than suede or mesh. The chunky midsole uses advanced foam cushioning, which can attract and hold dirt. Finally, the outsole is made of durable rubber, designed for superior grip and long-lasting wear. Understanding these distinct components ensures you choose the most effective and safest cleaning method for each part of your 9060s. This specific knowledge is key to maintaining their quality and extending their life.

### Gathering Your Cleaning Tools for 9060s

Before you begin the exciting process of cleaning your New Balance 9060 shoes, it is important to gather all the necessary tools. Having everything prepared in advance makes the entire cleaning session smooth and efficient. You will need a few simple but essential items. A soft-bristled brush, such as an old toothbrush or a dedicated shoe cleaning brush, is excellent for general scrubbing. For the delicate suede areas, a specialized suede brush is absolutely essential. It helps to lift the nap and remove dirt without causing damage. You will also need a few clean, soft microfiber cloths for wiping and drying.

For cleaning solutions, opt for a mild soap mixed with water. A gentle dish soap or a specialized shoe cleaner works well. It is important to avoid harsh detergents, bleach, or abrasive cleaners, as these can easily damage the delicate materials of your 9060s. A bowl of clean, warm water will be helpful for rinsing your cloths and brush. Paper towels or old newspapers are useful for stuffing the shoes after cleaning. This helps them absorb internal moisture and maintain their original shape during the drying process. Finally, consider a shoe protector spray. Applying this spray after cleaning will help repel future dirt and stains, keeping your cleaned shoes looking fresh for longer. Proper tools ensure your 9060s receive the best possible care.

### Basic Steps to Clean New Balance 9060 Shoes

Cleaning your New Balance 9060 shoes involves a few fundamental steps. Following these steps will help remove most of the accumulated dirt and grime from your beloved sneakers. I always start by removing the shoelaces and insoles. This allows you to thoroughly clean all parts of the shoe, ensuring no hidden dirt remains. You can wash the laces and insoles separately if they appear dirty; a simple hand wash with mild soap often works wonders.

Next, take a dry, soft brush and gently brush off any loose dirt or debris from the entire shoe. This includes the upper, midsole, and outsole. Remove any caked-on mud or dust before applying any liquids. After brushing, prepare your primary cleaning solution. Mix a small amount of mild soap, like a gentle liquid hand soap, with warm water in a bowl. Be careful not to use too much soap, as excessive suds can be hard to rinse out. Dip your soft brush into this solution, making sure it is damp but not dripping wet. Gently scrub the mesh and synthetic parts of the shoe using light, circular motions. Avoid saturating the shoe with too much water. Wipe away any excess foam or loosened dirt with a clean, damp cloth. Repeat these steps until the visible dirt is gone.

### Deep Cleaning Suede on Your New Balance 9060

Suede sections on your New Balance 9060 shoes demand special attention due to their delicate nature. Cleaning suede correctly is crucial to preserve its unique texture and appearance. My first rule is to ensure the suede is completely dry before you start. Any moisture can cause dirt to set deeper or leave water stains. Begin by using a dedicated suede brush to gently brush off any dry dirt, dust, or light scuffs. Always brush in one consistent direction to lift the nap of the suede. For minor scuffs or shiny spots, you can use a suede eraser. Gently rub the eraser over the mark; this helps to lift the dirt without wetting the material.

For tougher stains on suede, you will need a specific suede cleaner. Apply a very small amount of the cleaner onto a clean microfiber cloth. Then, dab the cloth onto the stained area. Avoid rubbing vigorously, as this can damage the suede fibers. You can use your suede brush to gently work the cleaner into the stain if needed. After applying the cleaner, wipe away any excess product with a slightly damp cloth, ensuring it is almost dry. Let the suede dry completely in a well-ventilated area. Once it is fully dry, use the suede brush again to restore the nap. Brush the fibers back into their original direction. This simple step helps the suede look fresh and uniform. Remember that improper cleaning can permanently ruin suede, so always be gentle and precise.
