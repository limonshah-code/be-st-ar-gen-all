If you own a Maytag top load washer, knowing how to clean its filter is essential. This simple task stops many common laundry problems.

Cleaning the filter keeps your machine working well. It helps your clothes come out fresh and truly clean. We will guide you through finding and cleaning your Maytag top load washer filter step-by-step. We will also cover why this task is so important. You will learn about the tools you need and common issues you might face. By the end, you will feel confident performing this important maintenance.

### Takeaway

Regularly cleaning your Maytag top load washer filter is a small task with big benefits. It improves washer performance, prevents odors, and extends your appliance's lifespan.

*   Locate the lint filter in your specific Maytag top load model.
*   Power off and unplug the washer before starting.
*   Remove the filter carefully and clean it under running water or with a brush.
*   Reinsert the clean filter securely into its housing.
*   Perform this cleaning every few months for best results.

### Clear, Concise Answer

To clean your Maytag top load washer filter, first unplug the machine. Find the filter, often near the agitator or at the tub's edge. Remove it, rinse away lint and debris, then scrub with a brush if needed. Reinstall the clean filter and restore power to your washer.

### Why Cleaning Your Maytag Washer Filter Matters

A Maytag top load washer works hard for you. It spins clothes, removes dirt, and rinses them clean. Over time, lint, hair, and small fabric pieces collect inside. These items gather in the washer's filter. If you do not clean this filter, it becomes clogged. This clog stops water from draining well. It also prevents your washer from cleaning clothes effectively. A dirty filter leads to several problems you want to avoid.

First, a clogged filter affects wash quality. Your clothes might not get as clean as they should. You might see lint on freshly washed items. This is a clear sign the filter needs attention. The washer cannot clear away debris properly if its filter is blocked. This impacts how well detergents work. Your laundry will not look or feel fresh.

Second, a dirty filter often causes bad odors. Trapped lint and debris stay wet inside the washer. This creates a breeding ground for mold and mildew. These fungi cause a musty smell that transfers to your clean clothes. Nobody wants smelly laundry. Regular filter cleaning helps air circulate better. This keeps moisture from building up. It prevents those unpleasant smells from starting. Cleaning your [Maytag washing machine](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-maytag-washing-machine) also involves keeping the tub and detergent dispenser clean.

Finally, ignoring the filter can damage your washing machine. A clogged filter makes the motor work harder. This puts stress on the washer's parts. Over time, this extra strain can cause expensive breakdowns. Proper maintenance, including filter cleaning, helps your Maytag top load washer last longer. It saves you money on repairs. It ensures your machine runs smoothly for many years. You can also learn how to [clean your washer with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-with-vinegar) for a deeper clean.

### Finding the Filter on Your Maytag Top Load Washer

Locating the filter on a Maytag top load washer can sometimes be tricky. Unlike front load models, top load washers often hide their filters. The exact location varies by model year and specific design. Knowing where to look saves you time and frustration. Always check your washer's user manual first. The manual provides the most accurate information for your specific Maytag model. It shows diagrams and specific instructions.

Many older Maytag top load washers have a self-cleaning filter. This means you do not need to access a physical filter to clean it. These models often have a lint collection system built into the agitator or wash basket. The lint gets flushed out during the drain cycle. If your manual states your washer has a "self-cleaning" or "self-linting" system, you might not find a removable filter at all. In such cases, running a regular cleaning cycle with a washing machine cleaner is usually enough. For a thorough clean, you can also learn [how to clean your Maytag top-load washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-maytag-top-load-washer) itself.

For models with a removable filter, here are common places to check:

*   **Around the Agitator:** Some Maytag top load washers have a filter inside or around the top of the agitator. The agitator is the central post that twists during the wash cycle. You might need to twist or pull up a cap on the agitator to reveal the filter. This filter often looks like a mesh screen or a cylindrical trap.
*   **Along the Top Rim of the Wash Tub:** Another common spot is under the top rim of the wash tub. Look for a small, removable cover or a slot. You might need to pry open a small access panel. The filter is often a screen or basket that pulls out.
*   **Near the Water Pump (Less Common for Top Load):** While more typical for front load washers, some top load models might have a filter near the water pump at the bottom front of the machine. This is usually behind a small access panel. If you are unsure, referring to your manual is always the best approach. It ensures you find the correct filter for your model. If you are struggling with a smelly washer, learning [how to clean a smelly washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-washer) might help.

### Step-by-Step Guide: How to Clean Maytag Top Load Washer Filter

Cleaning your Maytag top load washer filter is a straightforward process. Following these steps ensures a safe and effective clean. You will improve your washer's performance and extend its life. This is a task you can easily do yourself.

1.  **Safety First: Disconnect Power.** Before you touch any part of your washing machine, always unplug it from the wall outlet. This prevents any accidental starts or electrical shocks. Water and electricity do not mix safely. Make sure the machine is completely off.
2.  **Locate the Filter.** As discussed, the filter's location varies. Check your user manual first. Look for it inside the agitator, under the top rim of the wash tub, or potentially near the pump. Once found, identify how it removes. It might twist, pull out, or have a latch.
3.  **Remove the Filter.** Carefully detach the filter from its housing. Some filters are small mesh screens. Others are larger, cup-shaped traps. Be gentle when removing it to avoid damage. You might find a lot of lint, hair, and even small forgotten items like coins or buttons. These items are normal to find.
4.  **Clean the Filter.** Take the removed filter to a sink. Rinse it thoroughly under warm, running water. Use an old toothbrush or a small cleaning brush to scrub away any stuck-on lint, debris, or slimy residue. For stubborn build-up, you can soak the filter in a solution of warm water and a little mild detergent for about 15-20 minutes. This helps loosen grime. Make sure all visible debris is gone. If your washer is having drainage issues, you might also need to learn [how to clean your washer drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-drain).
5.  **Inspect and Dry.** After cleaning, inspect the filter for any signs of damage. Look for tears in the mesh or cracks in the plastic. A damaged filter cannot do its job properly. Allow the filter to air dry completely. You can also pat it dry with a clean cloth.
6.  **Reinsert the Filter.** Once dry and clean, place the filter back into its original position. Make sure it clicks or locks securely into place. It should fit snugly. A loose filter can become dislodged during a wash cycle. This prevents it from catching debris.
7.  **Reconnect Power and Test.** Plug your Maytag washer back into the outlet. Run an empty, short cycle with hot water. This helps flush any remaining cleaning solution. It also ensures the filter is properly seated and the machine operates correctly. Listen for any unusual noises. This test run confirms everything works as it should. Perform this cleaning task every three to six months for best results. This routine maintenance helps keep your Maytag washer in top condition.

### Essential Tools and Supplies for Filter Cleaning

Cleaning your Maytag top load washer filter does not require many specialized tools. Most items are likely already in your home. Having the right supplies makes the job easier and more effective. Being prepared helps you complete the task quickly and efficiently.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Gloves (Optional but Recommended):** Washer filters can be surprisingly dirty. They contain lint, hair, and sometimes mold or mildew. Wearing rubber gloves keeps your hands clean. It also protects them from any cleaning solutions you might use.
*   **Old Toothbrush or Small Cleaning Brush:** A small brush is essential for scrubbing away stubborn lint and grime. A stiff-bristled toothbrush works perfectly. It reaches into small crevices and removes trapped debris effectively. You want to clear all the mesh openings.
*   **Warm Water:** Running water is your primary cleaning agent. It helps rinse away loose lint and dirt. You will use it to flush the filter clean at the sink.
*   **Mild Detergent or All-Purpose Cleaner (Optional):** For filters with heavy build-up or a slimy film, a small amount of mild dish soap or an all-purpose cleaner can help. Mix it with warm water for soaking the filter. This loosens tough grime. Avoid harsh chemicals as they can damage the filter material.
*   **Paper Towels or Clean Cloths:** These are useful for wiping down the filter housing. They also help dry the filter before reinsertion. You can also use them to clean any spills that occur during the process.
*   **Flashlight (Optional):** In some cases, the filter location might be dark or hard to see. A small flashlight can help you locate the filter more easily. It also allows you to inspect the housing for any remaining debris after removal.
*   **Small Pliers or Flathead Screwdriver (Rarely Needed):** In rare instances, you might need a small tool to gently pry open a cover or twist a filter housing. However, most Maytag top load filters are designed for tool-free removal. Only use these tools if the manual specifically suggests it. Be very careful to avoid scratching or damaging plastic parts. For a good deep clean of your machine, you can also learn [how to clean your washer with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-with-vinegar).

Having these items ready before you start saves you trips back and forth. It makes the filter cleaning process smooth and hassle-free.

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting During Filter Cleaning

While cleaning your Maytag top load washer filter is usually simple, you might encounter a few common issues. Knowing how to troubleshoot these problems helps you complete the task without frustration. I have faced some of these myself. Being prepared makes the process smoother.

*   **Difficulty Locating the Filter:** The most common challenge is finding the filter. As mentioned, some Maytag top load models do not have a user-accessible filter. They have a self-cleaning system. If you cannot find a removable filter after checking the agitator and tub rim, consult your user manual again. If your manual confirms no removable filter, simply focus on regular cleaning cycles for the machine itself. Consider running an empty hot water cycle with a dedicated washer cleaner or a cup of white vinegar. This can help with general lint and odor issues even without a physical filter. You can also learn [how to clean your washer smell](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-smell) for optimal freshness.

*   **Filter Stuck or Hard to Remove:** Sometimes, lint and mineral deposits can make the filter stick. Do not force it. Gently wiggle the filter. If it is a twist-lock design, ensure you are twisting in the correct direction (usually counter-clockwise to loosen). You might need to gently pry it with a flathead screwdriver if it has a small lip, but only if the manual suggests it. Apply firm but gentle pressure. Avoid excessive force that could break plastic parts.

*   **Stubborn Debris or Slime:** Lint can become heavily matted and slimy, especially if the filter has not been cleaned in a long time. Running water alone might not remove it all. This is where your old toothbrush and mild detergent come in handy. Soak the filter in hot, soapy water for 15-30 minutes before scrubbing. This loosens the grime. You might need to repeat the scrubbing process a couple of times for truly stubborn build-up. For general odor concerns in your Maytag top loader, you might benefit from learning [how to clean your Maytag top-load washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-maytag-top-load-washer) itself, which often includes running a cleaning cycle.

*   **Filter Damage During Removal/Cleaning:** Be careful not to tear the mesh or break plastic clips. If the filter is damaged, it cannot effectively collect lint. You will need to order a replacement part from Maytag or an appliance parts supplier. Using a damaged filter means your washer will not perform its best. It might even cause more debris to enter the pump.

*   **Washer Not Draining After Cleaning:** If your washer suddenly stops draining after filter cleaning, first double-check that the filter is properly reinserted and secured. A loose filter can cause issues. Also, check that the drain hose is not kinked or clogged. Sometimes, cleaning the filter dislodges other debris further down the drain line. In such cases, you might need to investigate [how to clean your washer drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-drain). If the problem persists, it might indicate a larger issue with the drain pump. You might need professional help for this.

By anticipating these issues and knowing how to address them, you can ensure a smooth filter cleaning process. Regular maintenance prevents many of these problems from happening in the first place.

### Maintaining Your Maytag Washer for Long-Term Performance

Cleaning the filter is a key part of maintaining your Maytag top load washer, but it is not the only step. A comprehensive approach ensures your appliance provides reliable service for years. Think of your washer as an investment. Good care protects that investment.

*   **Regular Tub Cleaning:** Even if your filter is clean, the washer tub itself can develop residue and odors. Detergent, fabric softener, and hard water minerals build up over time. Use a washing machine cleaner monthly. Alternatively, run an empty hot water cycle with two cups of white vinegar or a quarter cup of baking soda. This helps sanitize the tub and remove lingering smells. This is an important step when you learn [how to clean your Maytag washing machine](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-maytag-washing-machine) properly.
*   **Clean the Detergent Dispenser:** Residue from liquid detergents and fabric softeners often accumulates in the dispenser. This can block the flow or leave sticky gunk. Pull out the dispenser drawer if possible and wash it in the sink with warm, soapy water. Use an old toothbrush to scrub away any sticky bits. For built-in dispensers, wipe them down regularly.
*   **Inspect Hoses:** Periodically check the water inlet hoses for cracks, bulges, or leaks. These hoses connect the washer to your water supply. A burst hose can cause major water damage. Replace them every five to seven years, or sooner if they show wear. Also, ensure the drain hose is not kinked or blocked. A clear drain hose is vital for efficient water removal.
*   **Balance the Load:** Overloading your washer strains the motor and agitator. It also prevents clothes from getting properly cleaned. Distribute clothes evenly around the agitator. This maintains balance during the spin cycle. An unbalanced load causes excessive shaking and wear on parts.
*   **Leave the Lid Open After Use:** After completing your laundry, leave the washer lid or door ajar for a few hours. This allows air to circulate inside the drum. It helps the interior dry out completely. This simple habit prevents mold and mildew growth. It also stops those musty smells from developing. This is also important for [how to clean your washer smell](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-smell).
*   **Use the Right Detergent:** Use high-efficiency (HE) detergent if your Maytag washer is an HE model. HE detergents produce less suds. Too many suds can leave residue and clog parts over time. Using the correct type and amount of detergent is crucial for cleanliness and machine health.

By following these maintenance tips, you ensure your Maytag top load washer remains efficient. It helps your machine operate at its best for a long time.

### When to Call a Professional for Washer Maintenance

While routine cleaning of your Maytag top load washer filter and general maintenance are excellent habits, some problems require a professional's expertise. Knowing when to call a technician can save you from bigger headaches and more costly repairs down the line. I always advise people not to attempt repairs beyond their skill level.

Here are signs it is time to call a professional:

*   **Persistent Leaks:** If your washer is leaking water from anywhere other than the drain hose, it is a serious issue. Small leaks can quickly become major floods. A professional can pinpoint the source of the leak. They can repair or replace faulty hoses, pumps, or seals. This is especially true if you notice water pooling under the machine.
*   **Unusual Noises:** Washers make some noise, but grinding, squealing, thumping, or loud banging sounds are red flags. These noises often indicate problems with the motor, transmission, bearings, or suspension system. These are complex components. They require specialized tools and knowledge to diagnose and repair.
*   **Washer Not Draining or Spinning:** If your Maytag top load washer fills with water but refuses to drain or spin, even after you clean the filter and check the drain hose, a pump issue or a motor problem may exist. These parts are essential for the wash cycle. A professional can determine if the pump is clogged, broken, or if the motor needs service. This is different from [how to clean your washer drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-drain), which is a simpler user fix.
*   **Electrical Issues:** If your washer is not turning on, tripping circuit breakers, or showing error codes related to electrical problems, do not try to fix it yourself. Electrical repairs can be dangerous. A qualified appliance technician has the training to handle electrical components safely. They can identify wiring issues or faulty control boards.
*   **Burning Smell:** A burning smell during operation is a critical warning sign. It could mean an overheated motor, damaged wiring, or a failing belt. Turn off the washer immediately and unplug it. Do not use it again until a professional inspects it. This prevents further damage or fire hazards.
*   **Error Codes You Cannot Resolve:** Modern Maytag washers often display digital error codes. Your user manual explains some common codes and fixes. If the manual does not list the code, or if you cannot fix the issue with the suggested steps, it indicates a more complex internal problem. A technician can interpret the code and perform the necessary repairs.
*   **Major Component Replacement:** Replacing parts like the motor, transmission, or main control board is usually beyond the average homeowner's ability. These repairs are intricate. They require specific parts and proper installation techniques. It is best to leave these jobs to a trained professional.

Calling a professional for these specific issues ensures safety. It also guarantees a correct diagnosis and repair. This extends the life of your valuable Maytag appliance.
