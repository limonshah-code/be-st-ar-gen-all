Signia Pure Charge And Go troubleshooting often involves basic checks. These include verifying the charging connection, cleaning the device thoroughly, and restarting the hearing aids or connected app. Most minor issues like no sound or poor connection can be fixed with these simple steps.

## Understanding Signia Pure Charge And Go Basics

Your Signia Pure Charge And Go hearing aids provide clear sound. They use advanced technology to enhance your listening experience. These devices are rechargeable, offering convenience and ease of use. Knowing their basic functions helps when problems arise.

The hearing aids have a built-in battery. This battery charges when you place the devices in their charging case. They connect wirelessly to your smartphone. This connection allows for app control and streaming audio. Familiarity with these features is the first step in successful Signia Pure Charge And Go troubleshooting.

Each hearing aid has a microphone, a sound processor, and a receiver. The microphone picks up sounds. The processor adjusts them for your hearing loss. The receiver then sends the amplified sound into your ear. Proper care ensures these parts work together. Regular cleaning prevents performance issues.

Understanding how your hearing aids charge is important. The charger uses induction to power the devices. Always ensure the hearing aids sit correctly in the charging slots. A stable power source is also necessary for efficient charging. Check the charging indicator lights. They tell you if charging is active or complete.

The Signia Pure Charge And Go models offer different features. Some have OVP (Own Voice Processing) for natural sound. Others include Bluetooth for easy phone calls. Read your specific model's manual. It provides details on its unique functions. This knowledge empowers you to identify problems quickly.

## Resolving Charging Issues with Your Hearing Aids

One common problem is when your Signia Pure Charge And Go hearing aid does not charge. This can be very frustrating. A non-charging device means no power for hearing. I always start by checking the power source. Is the charger plugged into a working outlet? Make sure the connection is firm.

Next, examine the charging cable. Check for any damage or kinks. A damaged cable cannot deliver power properly. Try using a different cable if you have one available. This helps rule out a faulty cable as the cause. Just like troubleshooting a general device, checking power is key. Sometimes, solving charging issues with one electronic device can offer insights for others, like when you are working on [EZ Go Golf Cart Charger Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/ez-go-golf-cart-charger-troubleshooting).

The hearing aids must sit correctly in the charging case. Each hearing aid has a specific slot. Ensure they align perfectly with the charging pins. The indicator lights on the charger show charging status. If lights are off, the connection might be poor. Gently adjust the hearing aids until the lights come on.

Clean the charging contacts on both the hearing aids and the charger. Dust or debris can block the connection. Use a soft, dry cloth or a small brush. Avoid using water or harsh chemicals. Clean contacts ensure efficient power transfer. This step is often overlooked but is very important.

A complete reset can sometimes fix charging problems. Remove the hearing aids from the charger. Disconnect the charger from the power outlet. Wait a few minutes. Then reconnect everything. Place the hearing aids back into the charger. This simple restart can resolve temporary glitches in the charging system.

If these steps do not work, the battery itself might be faulty. Batteries have a limited lifespan. Over time, they hold less charge. If your hearing aids are old, a professional check might be needed. They can assess battery health. Remember, persistent charging issues need expert attention.

## Troubleshooting Sound Quality Problems

Poor sound quality is another frequent complaint. Your Signia Pure Charge And Go hearing aids might sound muffled, weak, or produce no sound at all. The first suspect is often earwax or debris. Earwax can block the sound outlet. This prevents sound from reaching your ear effectively.

Regular cleaning is vital. Use the tools provided with your hearing aids. Gently brush away any visible wax or dirt. Pay close attention to the microphone ports and the wax guards. Replace wax guards regularly as recommended by Signia. A clogged wax guard significantly reduces sound. This is similar to how general device maintenance can impact performance, like following steps for [how to clean a Pure Enrichment Humidifier](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pure-enrichment-humidifier) to ensure it works correctly.

Check the domes or ear tips. These are the small silicone or plastic pieces that fit into your ear canal. They can become dislodged or damaged. A damaged dome can affect sound delivery. Ensure they are securely attached. Replace them if they show signs of wear. Ill-fitting domes also cause sound issues.

Sometimes, the sound problem is not physical. It might be related to your hearing aid settings. Check the volume level. Is it set too low? Adjust it using the buttons on the hearing aid or through the Signia app. Make sure the hearing aids are in the correct program. Accidental changes to programs can alter sound.

Your listening environment can also affect sound quality. Loud background noise can make voices unclear. Try switching to a different program designed for noisy environments. Some Signia models have features like noise reduction. If activated, these can improve clarity. Experiment with the settings in different situations.

A feedback whistling sound is also a common issue. This happens when amplified sound escapes the ear and re-enters the microphone. It often indicates an improper fit. Ensure your hearing aids are seated snugly in your ears. Domes or molds that are too small can cause feedback. Speak to your audiologist if feedback persists. They can check the fit.

If you have tried all these steps and sound quality remains poor, the internal components might be faulty. This needs professional diagnosis. Do not try to open or repair the hearing aids yourself. Internal damage can void your warranty. Contact your hearing care professional for assistance.

## Addressing Connectivity and App Issues

Your Signia Pure Charge And Go hearing aids connect to various devices. They link with your smartphone via Bluetooth for app control and streaming. Sometimes, these connections fail. This can prevent you from adjusting settings or taking calls. The first step is always to restart everything.

Restart your hearing aids. Take them out of the charger and then put them back in. This often reboots their internal system. Also, restart your smartphone. Turn it off and then on again. A simple device reboot can resolve many temporary glitches. This is a common first step when troubleshooting any electronic device, similar to how restarting can help when you are performing general [Whirlpool Side By Side Refrigerator Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/whirlpool-side-by-side-refrigerator-troubleshooting).

Next, check your smartphone's Bluetooth settings. Ensure Bluetooth is turned on. Forget your hearing aids from the device list if they were previously paired. Then, attempt to pair them again from scratch. The pairing process usually involves placing the hearing aids in pairing mode. Refer to your Signia manual for specific instructions on pairing.

Make sure your Signia app is up to date. App developers frequently release updates. These updates fix bugs and improve performance. Visit your phone's app store. Check for any available updates for the Signia app. An outdated app might not communicate well with your hearing aids.

If you are using accessories like a StreamLine Mic or StreamLine TV, troubleshoot those too. Ensure they are powered on and correctly paired. Just like the hearing aids, these devices can benefit from a simple restart. Check their indicator lights for proper function. Connectivity problems can stem from any part of the chain.

Signal interference can also disrupt connectivity. Other electronic devices can interfere with Bluetooth signals. Try moving away from other Wi-Fi routers, microwaves, or large metal objects. These can sometimes block or weaken the Bluetooth connection. Test your connection in a different location.

If you cannot establish a connection or the app keeps crashing, it might be an issue with your phone's compatibility. Check Signia's website for compatible devices. Not all phones work perfectly with all hearing aids. If all else fails, reinstall the Signia app. This can clear corrupted data. Persistent connectivity issues might require professional support.

## Handling Feedback and Whistling Sounds

Feedback, or whistling, from your Signia Pure Charge And Go hearing aids is a common yet annoying issue. This sound happens when amplified sound escapes your ear and re-enters the hearing aid's microphone. It creates a loop that produces the whistle. I find that the fit of the hearing aid is often the main culprit.

Ensure the hearing aid sits snugly in your ear canal. If the dome or ear mold is too small, sound can leak out. This leakage then gets picked up by the microphone. Try pushing the hearing aid deeper into your ear. If the whistling stops, you might need a larger dome or a custom ear mold. Your audiologist can help assess the fit.

Earwax buildup can also cause feedback. If wax blocks your ear canal, the sound from the hearing aid has nowhere to go. It reflects back, causing the whistle. Regularly clean your ears or have a professional remove wax. Also, clean your hearing aid's wax filter. A blocked filter stops sound from entering your ear, leading to feedback. This general principle of maintenance applies to many devices, as seen in steps for [Poweroll 2 by Top O Matic Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/poweroll-2-by-top-o-matic-troubleshooting) where proper upkeep prevents problems.

The volume setting can contribute to feedback. If the volume is too high, it increases the chance of sound leakage. Try lowering the volume slightly. If the whistling reduces, you have found the cause. You might need your audiologist to adjust your hearing aid's overall gain settings. They can fine-tune it to prevent feedback without compromising clarity.

Physical objects close to your ear can also cause feedback. When you put on a hat, a scarf, or even hold your hand close to your ear, sound can bounce off these objects and re-enter the microphone. Be mindful of how objects interact with your hearing aids. Adjusting your position or removing the object often resolves this.

A damaged or cracked tubing or dome can also lead to feedback. Inspect these components for any visible signs of wear. Even a small crack allows sound to escape. Replace any damaged parts immediately. Keep spare domes or tubes on hand. This ensures you can address minor issues quickly.

If whistling persists despite these efforts, it might indicate an internal component issue. A faulty receiver or microphone inside the hearing aid can cause feedback. This requires professional repair. Do not attempt to fix internal problems yourself. Contact your hearing care specialist for a thorough check and repair.

## Essential Maintenance and Care Tips

Proper maintenance extends the life of your Signia Pure Charge And Go hearing aids. It also prevents many common problems. I always advise a daily cleaning routine. After each use, wipe down your hearing aids with a soft, dry cloth. This removes sweat and grime.

Moisture is a major enemy of hearing aids. Always store your devices in their charging case when not in use. Some chargers include a drying function, which is very helpful. If not, consider using a hearing aid dehumidifier or a drying capsule overnight. This removes any moisture build-up. Avoid exposing your hearing aids to excessive humidity or direct water.

Regularly check and clean the wax guards and domes. Wax guards prevent earwax from entering the hearing aid's receiver. They need frequent replacement. Your audiologist can show you how. Domes should be cleaned with a brush. Replace them if they become stiff or discolored. Clean components ensure clear sound.

Protect your hearing aids from impacts. Avoid dropping them. Store them in a safe place away from children and pets. When cleaning or handling them, work over a soft surface. This minimizes damage if they accidentally fall. Treat them as delicate electronic devices.

Avoid extreme temperatures. Do not leave your hearing aids in direct sunlight or in a hot car. High temperatures can damage the internal components and batteries. Similarly, very cold temperatures can affect battery performance. Keep them at room temperature when possible.

Use only Signia-approved accessories and cleaning products. Other products might contain chemicals that harm your devices. Follow the cleaning instructions provided in your user manual. This ensures you use the correct methods and tools. Improper cleaning can lead to more problems.

Schedule regular check-ups with your hearing care professional. They can perform deep cleaning and professional maintenance. They also test your hearing aids to ensure optimal performance. These routine visits catch potential issues early. Professional care is essential for long-term device health. Consistent maintenance prevents many common issues.

## When to Seek Professional Assistance

Sometimes, self-troubleshooting is not enough. Your Signia Pure Charge And Go hearing aids might have a problem beyond simple fixes. Knowing when to contact a professional is important. If you have tried all the steps in this guide without success, it is time for expert help.

Persistent issues like complete power failure or no sound, even after charging and cleaning, need professional attention. These often point to an internal component failure. Hearing aid professionals have specialized tools for diagnosis. They can identify complex electrical faults. Do not attempt to open the hearing aids yourself. This can cause further damage and void your warranty.

If the hearing aids constantly produce feedback or whistling, despite proper fit and cleaning, a professional evaluation is necessary. This could mean the programming needs adjustment. Your audiologist can fine-tune the settings to prevent feedback. They can also check for micro-cracks in the casing that might cause sound leakage.

Problems with the charging case itself also require professional support. If the case does not charge or the charging lights malfunction, it might need repair or replacement. The charging case is crucial for daily use. Do not try to repair its internal wiring yourself.

Any physical damage to the hearing aids needs immediate professional review. If you drop them or they come into contact with water, even if they seem to work, have them checked. Hidden damage can lead to future problems. A professional can assess the extent of the damage.

If your hearing aids are still under warranty, contact your provider before attempting any significant repairs. Unauthorized repairs can void the warranty. Your hearing care professional can guide you on warranty claims and repair options. They work directly with Signia.

Finally, if your hearing loss changes, your hearing aids might not be programmed correctly for your current needs. This is not a troubleshooting issue but a medical one. Schedule a hearing test. Your audiologist can then reprogram your Signia Pure Charge And Go devices to match your updated prescription. This ensures you always get the best possible sound.
