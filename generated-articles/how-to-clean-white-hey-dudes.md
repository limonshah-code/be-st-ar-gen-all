### How do you clean white Hey Dudes?

You can clean white Hey Dudes by hand washing with mild soap and water for general dirt. Remove laces and insoles first. Gently scrub the canvas or knit material with a soft brush. For stubborn stains, use a baking soda paste or a stain remover. Always air dry them completely to prevent damage and odor.

### Understanding Your White Hey Dudes Material

Hey Dudes are known for their comfort and casual look. Their design often uses lightweight materials. Most white Hey Dudes are made from canvas, linen, or a blend of synthetic fabrics. These materials are breathable but can easily absorb dirt and stains.

My Hey Dudes often get dirty from daily wear. The woven texture of canvas and linen acts like a magnet for dust and grime. Spills and scuffs are also very visible on white surfaces. Understanding the material helps you choose the correct cleaning method. Harsh chemicals can damage the fabric or alter its color. Gentle care is always the best approach for these shoes. You want to clean them without changing their soft, flexible nature.

Different materials require slightly different cleaning approaches. Canvas is quite durable and handles gentle scrubbing well. Linen can be more delicate, needing a lighter touch. Some Hey Dudes have knit uppers, which can be even more sensitive to aggressive cleaning. Always test any cleaning solution on a small, hidden spot first. This step prevents accidental damage or discoloration to your beloved shoes. Knowing your shoe's specific material will ensure a safer and more effective cleaning process.

### Essential Cleaning Supplies You Will Need

Having the right tools makes cleaning much easier. Before you start, gather your supplies. This preparation ensures a smooth and effective cleaning session. You probably have most of these items at home already.

I always start by laying out everything I need. This prevents interruptions during the cleaning process. Here is a list of essential items:

*   **Mild Soap or Detergent:** Choose a gentle laundry detergent or dish soap. Baby shampoo also works well. Harsh chemicals can damage shoe materials. I avoid strong bleach, especially for colored elements on the shoe.
*   **Soft Brushes:** A soft-bristled brush, like an old toothbrush or a nail brush, is perfect. You need something that can get into the fabric weave. A coarser brush might damage the material.
*   **Microfiber Cloths or Sponges:** These are good for applying solutions and wiping away dirt. They are gentle on the shoe's surface. Make sure they are clean and free of dyes.
*   **Small Bowls:** You will need one for mixing your cleaning solution. Another bowl can hold clean water for rinsing. This keeps your workspace organized.
*   **Old Towels:** Lay down towels to protect your work surface. They will catch drips and excess water. You can also use them to blot shoes dry.
*   **Stain Removers (Optional):** For tough spots, consider a dedicated shoe cleaner or a paste of baking soda and water. Hydrogen peroxide can also brighten whites.
*   **Protective Spray (Optional):** After cleaning, a water and stain repellent spray helps keep shoes cleaner longer.

Using the right tools protects your shoes. It also makes the cleaning process more efficient. These simple supplies will help you keep your white Hey Dudes looking their best.

### Pre-Cleaning Steps: Preparing Your Hey Dudes for a Deep Clean

Preparation is a crucial first step for any cleaning task. Skipping this stage can make your cleaning less effective. Proper pre-cleaning helps loosen dirt and protect delicate parts of your shoes. I always begin with these preparatory actions.

First, I take out the laces from both shoes. Laces collect a lot of dirt and can be cleaned separately. You can hand wash them with a small amount of soap and water. Then, rinse them well and hang them to dry. Removing laces also gives you full access to the shoe's tongue and eyelets. This ensures an even clean across the whole shoe.

Next, I remove the insoles. Hey Dudes often have comfortable foam insoles. These insoles can absorb sweat and odors. I recommend cleaning them separately. You can sprinkle them with baking soda to absorb odors. Let the baking soda sit for a few hours, then brush it off. For a deeper clean, gently wipe them with a damp cloth and mild soap. Allow them to air dry completely before putting them back into the shoes. Do not soak them, as this can damage their structure.

After removing laces and insoles, brush off any loose dirt. Use a soft-bristled brush, like an old toothbrush or a dry cloth. Gently brush the entire surface of the shoes. This step removes dry mud, dust, and loose debris. This prevents these particles from becoming mud when they mix with water. I focus on the soles too, removing any trapped pebbles or dirt. A dry pre-clean makes the wet cleaning much more efficient and reduces scrubbing time. This careful preparation sets the stage for a truly sparkling result.

### Hand Washing Methods for White Hey Dudes

Hand washing is the safest and most recommended method for cleaning white Hey Dudes. This approach allows you to control the cleaning intensity. It helps protect the shoe's material and shape. I find hand washing very effective for general dirt and light stains.

Start by mixing your cleaning solution. Pour a small amount of mild liquid laundry detergent or dish soap into a bowl. Add warm water to dilute the soap. You want a soapy solution, not thick suds. Avoid using too much soap, as it can be difficult to rinse out. A little goes a long way with delicate fabrics.

Now, dip your soft brush or clean cloth into the solution. Do not saturate the entire shoe at once. Work on one section at a time. Gently scrub the surface of the shoe. Use small, circular motions. Focus on areas with visible dirt or scuffs. For canvas or linen, scrubbing too hard can damage the fibers. Be gentle but firm enough to lift the dirt. You will see the dirt transfer from the shoe to your cloth or brush. I make sure to clean the rubber rand (the strip around the sole) too. This part often collects scuffs. For the rubber parts, you can use a slightly firmer brush. [Cleaning white rubber shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-rubber-shoes) can make a big difference in the overall look of your Hey Dudes.

After scrubbing, use a clean, damp cloth to wipe away the soap residue. Rinse the cloth often in clean water. Repeat this wiping process until all soap is gone. Soap left on the fabric can attract new dirt later. It can also leave a yellowish tint as the shoe dries. Ensure you get into all the crevices. This thorough rinsing is vital for a bright, clean finish. I repeat the process until the shoe looks clean. Sometimes, a second light scrub is needed for tougher areas. This method is effective and keeps your Hey Dudes in good condition.

### Tackling Stubborn Stains on White Hey Dudes

Some stains need more than a general wash. Stubborn marks like mud, grass, or oil can be tricky on white fabric. I have found specific solutions work best for these challenges. Addressing stains quickly is important. Fresh stains are always easier to remove.

For mud and dirt stains, let the mud dry completely first. Do not try to wipe wet mud, as this can spread it further. Once dry, gently brush off as much as you can with a stiff brush. Then, create a paste using baking soda and a small amount of water. Apply this paste directly onto the stain. Let it sit for about 15-20 minutes. The baking soda helps lift the dirt. After it sits, scrub gently with a soft brush and then rinse with a damp cloth. This method is often very effective. For more general advice on muddy shoes, you might find tips on [how to clean mud off white shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mud-off-white-shoes) helpful.

Grease or oil stains require a different approach. These stains can be tough on fabric shoes like Hey Dudes. Start by blotting excess oil with a paper towel. Do not rub, as rubbing pushes the oil deeper into the fibers. Sprinkle a generous amount of cornstarch or talcum powder directly onto the stain. These powders absorb oil. Let it sit for several hours, or even overnight. The powder will absorb the grease. After absorption, brush off the powder. Then, proceed with a gentle hand wash using mild soap and water as described before. You may need to repeat this process if the stain is very set.

Scuff marks can also appear on white Hey Dudes, especially on the rubber parts. A magic eraser can work wonders on these. Lightly dampen the magic eraser. Gently rub the scuff mark. The abrasive nature of the eraser helps lift the marks without harsh chemicals. For fabric scuffs, a paste of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide can be very effective. Mix a small amount of baking soda with just enough hydrogen peroxide to form a thick paste. Apply it to the scuff. Let it sit for 30 minutes, then scrub gently and rinse. Hydrogen peroxide is also useful for overall brightening, as you would use to [clean white shoes with hydrogen peroxide](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes-with-hydrogen-peroxide). Always remember to rinse thoroughly to remove all cleaning agents.

### Machine Washing White Hey Dudes (Use Caution!)

While hand washing is preferable, machine washing is an option for very dirty Hey Dudes. However, you must use extreme caution. Machine washing can potentially damage the shoe's shape, sole, or fabric. I only recommend this as a last resort for heavily soiled shoes.

First, prepare your shoes properly. Remove the laces and insoles, just as you would for hand washing. Brush off any loose dirt or mud. This prevents the dirt from redepositing onto the clean fabric. Place your Hey Dudes in a mesh laundry bag or a pillowcase. Secure the bag or pillowcase with a knot or rubber band. This protective measure prevents the shoes from banging around inside the machine. It also protects the shoes from snagging on other items.

Next, choose the right washing machine settings. Always use the delicate or gentle cycle. Select cold water only. Hot water can shrink or damage the shoe materials and adhesives. Use a small amount of mild liquid detergent. Avoid using powder detergents, as they may not dissolve completely and can leave residue. Do not add bleach, even for white shoes, as it can weaken fibers or react negatively with adhesives. If you are washing other items with the shoes, make sure they are similar white colors. I sometimes add a few old towels to the wash. This helps cushion the shoes and balances the load.

After the wash cycle, remove the shoes immediately. Do not put them in the dryer. High heat will cause shrinking, warping, and damage to the shoe's structure and glues. Drying is a critical step that must be done correctly. Machine washing simplifies the scrubbing but adds risks to the drying process. Always prioritize shoe safety over convenience. If you are familiar with washing other canvas shoes, the principles are similar to [cleaning white Converse shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-converse-shoes).

### Drying Your White Hey Dudes Properly

Proper drying is as important as proper cleaning. Incorrect drying can lead to shrinkage, misshapen shoes, or unpleasant odors. Always air dry your Hey Dudes. Never put them in a dryer. High heat can melt glues, warp the material, and cause permanent damage. I make sure my shoes dry slowly and naturally.

After cleaning, gently reshape your shoes. You can stuff them with white paper towels or clean, white cloths. Avoid using colored paper or newspaper, as the ink can transfer to your white shoes. The paper towels help absorb excess moisture from the inside. They also help maintain the shoe's original shape as it dries. Change the paper towels every few hours if they become very damp. This speeds up the internal drying process.

Place your Hey Dudes in a well-ventilated area. Choose a spot away from direct sunlight or artificial heat sources. A shaded outdoor area or a room with good airflow is ideal. Direct sunlight can cause yellowing on white fabric over time. It can also dry the material too quickly, making it stiff or brittle. I often place them near an open window or a fan. This gentle airflow promotes evaporation. It prevents moisture from lingering, which could lead to mildew or a musty smell.

Drying time can vary. It depends on the humidity and temperature of your environment. It also depends on how wet the shoes got during cleaning. Typically, Hey Dudes can take 24 to 48 hours to dry completely. Make sure they are thoroughly dry before you wear them or put the insoles back in. Wearing damp shoes can cause discomfort and lead to odors. Being patient during the drying process ensures your Hey Dudes retain their comfort, shape, and fresh appearance. This step contributes significantly to their longevity and look.

### Restoring Whiteness and Brightness

Sometimes, cleaning alone is not enough to restore pure white shoes. Over time, white fabrics can develop a dull or yellowish tint. This happens due to oxidation or mineral deposits from water. I have a few tricks to bring back that brilliant white.

Baking soda and hydrogen peroxide paste is a powerful brightener. Mix equal parts baking soda and hydrogen peroxide to form a thick paste. Apply this paste generously to any yellowed or dull areas. Use a soft brush to gently rub it into the fabric. Let the paste sit on the shoes for at least 30 minutes, or even a few hours for stubborn yellowing. The hydrogen peroxide acts as a mild bleaching agent, while baking soda provides gentle abrasion and helps lift stains. Rinse the shoes thoroughly with cool water afterward. Ensure all paste is removed. Then, air dry them in a well-ventilated area. This method is excellent for refreshing the overall whiteness. It is similar to methods used for other white footwear, such as [cleaning white mesh sneakers](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-mesh-sneakers).

Sunlight can also be a natural whitener. After applying a brightening paste and rinsing, place your damp shoes in direct sunlight. The UV rays from the sun have a natural bleaching effect. This can help further reduce yellowing and enhance the brightness of white fabrics. However, do not leave them in the sun for excessively long periods. Too much sun can weaken the fabric or cause other parts of the shoe to yellow if not properly rinsed. I often do this step on a sunny day after a thorough cleaning.

For ongoing maintenance, consider using a white shoe polish or paint pen. These products are designed to cover minor scuffs and restore color. They are not a substitute for cleaning but can be great for touch-ups. Apply them thinly and evenly to any areas that need a color boost. Always follow the product instructions carefully. These brightening techniques, when used correctly, can bring your white Hey Dudes back to their original pristine condition.

### Preventative Care for White Hey Dudes

Prevention is key to keeping your white Hey Dudes clean. It is much easier to prevent dirt than to remove it. Implementing a few simple habits can significantly extend the time between deep cleans. I always practice preventative care with my white shoes.

First, use a protective spray before wearing your new Hey Dudes. Look for a water and stain repellent spray specifically designed for fabric shoes. These sprays create an invisible barrier on the shoe's surface. This barrier makes it harder for dirt, water, and stains to penetrate the fabric. It acts like a shield, causing liquids to bead up and roll off. I usually apply two light coats, allowing each coat to dry completely between applications. Reapply the spray every few weeks or months, depending on how often you wear your shoes. This initial protection is your first line of defense against everyday grime.

Second, avoid wearing your white Hey Dudes in dirty environments. This might seem obvious, but it is worth stating. If you know you will be walking through muddy areas or dusty trails, choose a different pair of shoes. White shoes are best for clean, dry conditions. While they are casual, they are not designed for heavy-duty outdoor adventures that involve a lot of dirt. Being mindful of where you wear them will drastically reduce how often they need cleaning.

Finally, clean minor scuffs and dirt spots immediately. Do not let small marks sit and set into the fabric. Carry a small shoe cleaning wipe or a damp cloth with you. When you notice a fresh mark, gently wipe it away as soon as possible. Fresh stains are always easier to remove than old, dried-on ones. A quick wipe can save you from a full cleaning session later. Store your Hey Dudes in a clean, dry place when not in use. You can even keep them in their original box or a shoe bag to protect them from dust. These simple preventative steps help keep your white Hey Dudes looking sharp for a long time.
