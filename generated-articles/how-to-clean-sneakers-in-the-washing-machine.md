You can safely clean sneakers in the washing machine by removing laces and insoles, pre-treating stains, placing them in a mesh bag, and using a cold, delicate cycle with mild detergent. Air drying them is key to maintaining shape and material integrity.

## Preparing Your Washing Machine to Clean Sneakers

Before you put dirty shoes into your washer, consider its cleanliness. A clean washing machine helps clean your shoes better. It also prevents dirt from previous washes from transferring to your sneakers. I always make sure my machine is ready. This step is important for good results.

Start by checking your washing machine drum. Look for any grime or residue left from earlier laundry loads. You might see soap scum or lint inside. If your machine is dirty, it is a good idea to clean it first. A quick cleaning cycle with some household items works well. This prepares a fresh environment for your shoes. A clean machine helps keep your sneakers looking their best.

You should also check the rubber gasket around the door if you have a front-loader. This area often collects mold and mildew. These substances can transfer to your shoes during washing. You can wipe this area with a damp cloth or a gentle cleaning solution. This simple step stops odors and stains from spreading. A clean gasket protects your sneakers from unwanted grime. Taking a few minutes to clean your machine ensures a successful wash for your sneakers. It also protects your machine from odors.

## Gathering Your Supplies for Sneaker Washing

You need a few key items before you begin washing your sneakers. Having everything ready makes the process smooth. I always gather my supplies first. This prevents me from stopping mid-task. Knowing what you need simplifies cleaning.

First, you need a good brush. A soft-bristled brush or an old toothbrush works well. This helps remove loose dirt from your shoes before washing. Next, get a mild laundry detergent. Choose one without harsh chemicals or dyes. Harsh detergents can damage shoe materials. I prefer liquid detergents as they dissolve better. You also need a mesh laundry bag. This bag protects your sneakers during the wash. It prevents them from hitting the drum too hard. The bag also keeps laces and insoles from getting tangled. You can buy these bags at any laundry supply store.

Consider pre-treating solutions for tough stains. A mixture of water and mild soap works for most spots. For really stubborn dirt, you might use a paste of baking soda and a little water. This gentle paste lifts grime without harming the shoe fabric. You can learn more about general cleaning with these household items here: [How To Clean With Vinegar And Baking Soda](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-with-vinegar-and-baking-soda). Another option is a dedicated shoe cleaner. These are made for specific shoe materials. Having the right tools ensures your sneakers get a safe and effective wash.

## Preparing Your Sneakers for the Wash Cycle

Proper preparation is vital before putting your sneakers into the washing machine. This step prevents damage to your shoes and your machine. It also ensures a deeper clean. I always take time to prepare my sneakers. This small effort yields better results.

Start by removing the laces from your sneakers. Laces can get tangled during the wash. They can also get caught in the machine's agitator or drum. Wash laces separately by hand or place them in a small mesh bag. Next, take out the insoles. Insoles often hold more odor and dirt than the rest of the shoe. They may also shrink or lose their shape in the washer. Clean insoles by hand with soap and water. Let them air dry completely before putting them back.

Now, remove any loose dirt or debris from your shoes. Use a soft brush or an old toothbrush. Scrape off dried mud from the soles. Brush away surface dirt from the fabric. This step prevents large chunks of dirt from clogging your washing machine's drain. For stubborn dirt or scuffs, pre-treat them. Apply a small amount of mild detergent or a paste of baking soda and water directly onto the stain. Gently scrub the spot with a brush. Let it sit for about 15-20 minutes. This helps break down the grime. You might find this process similar to preparing other items for a machine wash, like [how to wash a hat in a washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-wash-a-hat-in-washing-machine). Properly preparing your sneakers protects them and helps the washing machine work more efficiently.

## Choosing the Right Washing Machine Settings for Shoes

Selecting the correct washing machine settings is crucial for cleaning sneakers without damage. Wrong settings can shrink shoes or damage their materials. I always use specific settings for my sneakers. This protects them and ensures they come out clean.

First, choose the right water temperature. Always use cold water when washing sneakers. Hot water can cause shoes to shrink. It can also warp the glue that holds shoe parts together. Cold water is gentler on delicate materials. It also helps prevent colors from bleeding. This keeps your sneakers looking new. I find cold water cleans very well without harm.

Next, pick a gentle wash cycle. Look for options like "delicate," "gentle," or "hand wash." These cycles use less agitation. Less agitation means less stress on your shoes. It prevents them from hitting the drum too hard. Avoid "heavy duty" or "normal" cycles. These are too aggressive for most sneakers. You should also choose a slow spin cycle. A high spin can throw shoes around too much. It can also cause them to lose their shape. A slow spin removes enough water without causing damage.

Finally, use a mild laundry detergent. A small amount is enough. Too much detergent can leave residue on your shoes. It can also be hard to rinse out completely. I suggest using about half the amount you would for a regular load. Liquid detergent is better than powder. Powder detergents sometimes do not dissolve fully. This can leave white marks on your shoes. Following these settings ensures your sneakers get clean safely.

## Loading and Washing Your Sneakers Safely

Loading your washing machine correctly is just as important as the settings. Proper loading protects both your sneakers and your appliance. I follow specific steps when I put my shoes in the washer. This prevents loud banging and potential damage.

First, place your prepared sneakers into a mesh laundry bag. This bag acts as a cushion. It also keeps the shoes contained. If you do not have a mesh bag, a pillowcase tied at the top works too. Place one shoe per bag if they are very large. This prevents them from tumbling too much. Putting them in a bag also protects your washing machine's drum from direct impact.

Next, add some old towels to the wash. Place 2-4 old towels in the machine with your bagged sneakers. The towels act as a buffer. They absorb some of the impact during the wash cycle. This reduces the banging noise. It also prevents your shoes from getting damaged by hitting the hard drum. Choose towels that are similar in color to your shoes, especially if your shoes are light-colored. This prevents any color transfer. Make sure these are old towels you do not mind getting dirty.

Do not overload your washing machine. Two pairs of sneakers are usually enough for one wash, plus the towels. Overloading prevents a proper clean. It also puts stress on your machine. Start the wash cycle with your chosen gentle settings. Stay near the machine during the first few minutes. Listen for excessive banging. If it is too loud, pause the machine. Readjust the towels around the shoes. This helps balance the load. A balanced load leads to a quieter and more effective wash. You can find information on how to prepare your machine for general cleaning tasks, like [how to clean your washing machine with baking soda and vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-with-baking-soda-and-vinegar), which ensures a cleaner wash for your shoes. Taking these steps makes washing sneakers a smooth process.

## Drying Your Clean Sneakers After Washing

Drying your sneakers properly is just as important as washing them. Incorrect drying can warp their shape or damage materials. I never put my sneakers in a dryer. This machine can cause shrinking and cracking. Air drying is always the best method.

After the wash cycle finishes, immediately remove your sneakers from the machine. Take them out of the mesh bag. Check for any remaining detergent residue. If you see some, you can rinse the shoes briefly under cold water. Gently press out excess water with a clean towel. Do not wring or twist your shoes. This can damage their structure.

Find a cool, well-ventilated area for drying. Place your sneakers upside down or on their sides. This allows air to circulate inside. You can stuff the shoes with white paper towels or newspaper. This helps absorb moisture and maintains the shoe's shape. Avoid colored newspaper, as ink can transfer. Change the paper every few hours, especially in the beginning. This speeds up the drying process. Do not use heat sources like radiators or direct sunlight. High heat can cause the glue to melt. It can also make materials like leather or rubber crack. Direct sun can also fade colors.

Drying time varies based on shoe material and humidity. It usually takes 24-48 hours for sneakers to dry completely. Make sure they are fully dry before wearing them again. Wearing damp shoes can lead to bad odors and mildew growth. Patience with drying ensures your sneakers stay in good condition.

## Post-Wash Sneaker Care and Maintenance

After your sneakers are clean and dry, a little ongoing care keeps them looking fresh. Proper maintenance extends their lifespan. I always do a few things after washing. This ensures my shoes stay clean longer.

First, check your sneakers for any remaining minor stains. Sometimes, tough spots need a second light cleaning. You can use a damp cloth with a tiny bit of mild soap for these. Gently rub the area until the stain lifts. Wipe away any soap residue. This final touch makes sure your sneakers look perfect.

Consider applying a protective spray to your sneakers. Many brands offer water and stain repellent sprays. These sprays create a barrier on the shoe's surface. They help repel liquids and prevent new stains from setting in. Apply the spray according to product instructions. Do this in a well-ventilated area. This step adds an extra layer of defense against daily wear. It keeps your shoes cleaner between washes.

Proper storage also helps maintain your clean sneakers. Store them in a cool, dry place. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight. Sunlight can fade colors over time. If you have shoe trees, use them. Shoe trees help maintain the shape of your sneakers. They also absorb moisture. For odor control, you can place cedar balls or activated charcoal pouches inside. These absorb moisture and smells. This prevents future odors from building up. By following these simple maintenance tips, your freshly cleaned sneakers will stay looking great.
