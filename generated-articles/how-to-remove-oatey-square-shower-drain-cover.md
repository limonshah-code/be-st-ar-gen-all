### Takeaway:

To remove an Oatey square shower drain cover, first identify its type (screw-in, snap-in, or friction-fit). For screw-in models, simply use a screwdriver to loosen the visible screws. For snap-in or friction-fit covers, use a flat-head screwdriver or putty knife to gently pry it up, or a suction cup for a firm grip.

### Understanding Your Oatey Square Shower Drain Cover

Before you begin removing your Oatey square shower drain cover, it is vital to know its design. Oatey makes several types of drain covers. Each type requires a slightly different approach for removal. Knowing your specific cover type saves you time and prevents damage.

Many Oatey square drain covers use screws. You can see these screws on the cover's surface. They hold the drain cover securely in place. These are generally easy to remove with a standard screwdriver. Other Oatey covers may use a friction-fit design. This means they simply sit tightly in the drain opening. They have no visible screws. You lift these covers directly. Still, other covers might snap into place. These often have small clips or tabs underneath. You need to gently pry them up. Some covers are even integrated into the tile. These grouted-in covers present a different challenge. You will need to carefully remove surrounding grout before lifting them. Understanding these distinctions is your first step. It helps you choose the right tools and method.

### Essential Tools for Oatey Drain Removal

Having the correct tools makes removing your Oatey square shower drain cover easy. You do not need many specialized items. Most tools are common household items. Gather them before you start the job. This prevents interruptions.

For screw-in covers, you will need a screwdriver. A Phillips head screwdriver is common for many drain screws. Sometimes, a flat-head screwdriver is required. Make sure the screwdriver tip fits the screw head properly. This prevents stripping the screws. For covers without screws, you might use a flat-head screwdriver or a putty knife. These tools help you gently pry up the cover. A suction cup can also be very helpful for flat covers. It provides a strong grip. You can lift the cover straight up with it. Remember to have a pair of work gloves. They protect your hands. A small bucket or rag can catch any debris. Having these tools ready ensures a smooth removal process.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Removing a Screw-In Oatey Square Drain Cover

Removing a screw-in Oatey square shower drain cover is usually straightforward. Many Oatey drains use this design. This method is common for most homeowners. Follow these steps carefully to avoid any issues.

First, locate all the screws on your Oatey drain cover. Most square covers have two or four screws. They are typically near the edges. Choose the right screwdriver for these screws. This is usually a Phillips head, but sometimes it is a flat head. Insert the screwdriver firmly into the screw head. Turn the screwdriver counter-clockwise to loosen each screw. You might find some screws are tight or slightly corroded. Apply steady pressure. Be careful not to strip the screw heads. If a screw feels stuck, try applying a small amount of penetrating oil. Wait a few minutes for it to work. Once all screws are loose, gently lift the drain cover. It should come up easily. Place the screws in a safe spot. You do not want to lose them. Now, you can access the drain opening for cleaning or inspection.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Removing a Friction-Fit or Snap-In Oatey Square Drain Cover

Friction-fit or snap-in Oatey square shower drain covers offer a cleaner look. They do not have visible screws. Their removal requires a slightly different technique. These types can sometimes be a bit trickier to lift.

Start by examining the edges of your drain cover. Look for a small gap between the cover and the shower floor. If you see one, insert the tip of a flat-head screwdriver or a sturdy putty knife into this gap. Gently pry upwards. Work your way around the edges. Apply even pressure as you lift. Do not force it. You risk damaging the cover or the surrounding tile. For covers with a flat, smooth surface, a suction cup can be very effective. Press the suction cup firmly onto the center of the drain cover. Ensure it creates a strong seal. Then, pull the suction cup upwards. The cover should lift free. Some snap-in covers have small tabs. You might need to press or manipulate these tabs. Take your time with this step. Once the cover lifts, you can proceed with drain maintenance.

### Dealing with Stubborn or Grouted Oatey Drain Covers

Sometimes, an Oatey square shower drain cover can be stubborn. This often happens due to mineral buildup, corrosion, or if it is grouted in place. Dealing with these situations requires extra care. For a cover that simply won't budge, apply penetrating oil. Spray it around the edges of the drain cover. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes. The oil can help loosen any rust or mineral deposits. Then, try your chosen removal method again. If you have a screw-in type, ensure your screwdriver fits perfectly. Avoid stripping the screws. For grouted covers, the process is more involved. This means the drain cover is set directly into the tile grout. You must carefully remove the surrounding grout first. You can use a grout saw or a utility knife for this. Score along the grout lines that frame the drain cover. Work slowly and precisely. Avoid cutting into the tile itself. Once the grout is sufficiently loosened or removed, you can then try to lift the cover. This type of removal might be similar to [how to remove a shower drain cover that is grouted in](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-remove-shower-drain-cover-that-is-grouted-in). You might also need to clean around the edges if there is a lot of rust, similar to [how to clean a rusted drain cover](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-rusted-drain-cover). Patience is key with stubborn covers. Do not force anything too much.

### Post-Removal: Cleaning and Maintenance

Once your Oatey square shower drain cover is successfully removed, the real work begins. This is your chance to clean the drain thoroughly. Most slow drains result from accumulated hair and soap scum. Take a deep breath. This part might not be pleasant, but it is necessary.

First, wear your gloves. You will likely encounter a messy situation. Use needle-nose pliers or a drain snake to remove any visible hair and debris. Pull out everything you can see. This often includes long strands of hair mixed with soap scum. This is a common cause of a [slow shower drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-speed-up-a-slow-shower-drain). After removing large blockages, flush the drain with hot water. You can then pour a mixture of baking soda and vinegar down the drain. Let it fizz for 30 minutes. This helps break down remaining gunk. Follow this with another hot water flush. For deeper cleaning, consider cleaning the [shower drain trap](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shower-drain-trap). If you notice a dark, sludgy buildup, that's likely a mix of soap, hair, and bacteria. Learning [how to clean black sludge from a shower drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-black-sludge-from-shower-drain) can be very helpful. Remember to clean the drain cover itself too. Scrub it with an old toothbrush and some all-purpose cleaner. Ensure it is free of soap scum and hair before replacing it. Regular cleaning prevents future clogs.

### When to Call a Professional

While removing an Oatey square shower drain cover is often a DIY task, sometimes you need expert help. Knowing when to call a professional plumber saves you time and potential damage. Do not hesitate to seek assistance if you face certain challenges.

If the drain cover simply will not budge, even after trying all methods, a professional can help. They have specialized tools and more experience. If you accidentally strip a screw head, a plumber has techniques to extract it without damaging the drain assembly. Should you notice a persistent foul odor after cleaning, it might indicate a deeper issue. This could be a problem with your P-trap or main sewer line. If water still drains slowly even after a thorough cleaning, the clog might be further down the pipe. A plumber can use specialized cameras to find the exact location of the blockage. They can also use powerful augers to clear it. Any sign of a leak around the drain also warrants professional attention. It might suggest a broken seal or pipe. Your safety is important. Do not risk damaging your plumbing or injuring yourself. A plumber ensures the job is done correctly and safely.

### Reinstalling Your Oatey Square Shower Drain Cover

After cleaning your Oatey square shower drain, it is time to put the cover back. Reinstallation is generally simpler than removal. Following proper steps ensures a secure fit. A well-seated drain cover prevents debris from entering the pipes easily.

First, make sure the drain opening is clear. Remove any tools or cleaning supplies from the area. Wipe down the drain opening and the underside of the drain cover. Ensure both surfaces are clean and dry. This helps the cover sit flush. For screw-in covers, align the screw holes on the cover with the holes in the drain assembly. Place the screws back into their respective holes. Turn them clockwise with your screwdriver. Tighten each screw securely. Do not overtighten them. Overtightening can strip the screws or crack the drain assembly. For friction-fit or snap-in covers, simply place the cover over the drain opening. Apply firm, even pressure. Push it down until it sits flush with the shower floor. You might hear a small click if it is a snap-in type. Double-check that the cover is stable. It should not wobble or move easily. Run a little water into the drain to confirm proper drainage. This final check ensures everything works correctly. Your shower drain is now ready for use.

## FAQ Section

### How often should I remove and clean my Oatey shower drain cover?
You should remove and clean your Oatey shower drain cover every 1-3 months. This frequency helps prevent major clogs. If you have long hair or multiple people use the shower, clean it more often. Regular cleaning keeps water draining smoothly. It also prevents unpleasant odors from building up.

### What if the screws on my Oatey drain cover are stripped?
If the screws on your Oatey drain cover are stripped, you have a few options. Try using a screw extractor kit. These kits can grip damaged screw heads. You can also try using a larger flat-head screwdriver if the head is only slightly rounded. If these fail, you may need to drill out the screws. In such cases, it is best to call a professional plumber to avoid further damage.

### Can I use a chemical drain cleaner after removing the cover?
You can use a chemical drain cleaner after removing the cover, but with caution. It is usually better to remove hair and debris manually first. Chemical cleaners can be harsh on pipes. They also pose a risk to your skin and eyes. Follow product instructions carefully. Consider natural alternatives like baking soda and vinegar first.

### How do I prevent my Oatey shower drain from clogging after cleaning?
To prevent future clogs, install a hair catcher or drain protector. These devices sit on top of or inside the drain cover. They catch hair and large debris. Regularly clean the drain protector. Avoid washing excessive hair or debris down the drain. Pouring hot water down the drain weekly also helps flush away minor buildup.

### My Oatey drain cover seems glued down. What should I do?
If your Oatey drain cover seems glued down, it is likely grouted into the tile. You must carefully remove the grout surrounding the drain cover. Use a grout saw or a utility knife.

### Is it safe to pour boiling water down my shower drain after cleaning?
Pouring boiling water down your shower drain is generally safe for metal pipes. However, avoid using boiling water with PVC pipes. Very hot water can soften or warp PVC, potentially causing leaks. Stick to very hot tap water for PVC pipes. Always use caution to prevent scalding yourself.
