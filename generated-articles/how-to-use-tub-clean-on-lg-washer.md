## Keep Your LG Washer Fresh: How to Use Tub Clean

Have you ever noticed a stale smell from your laundry or your washing machine itself? It is a common problem. Your LG washer, despite cleaning clothes, needs cleaning too. Residue from detergent, fabric softener, and dirt from clothes can build up inside the drum.

This buildup leads to unpleasant odors and can affect how clean your clothes get. Luckily, LG washers have a special "Tub Clean" cycle. This cycle helps you deep clean the inside of your machine. I will show you how to use Tub Clean on LG washer models.

This article provides a clear guide. We will discuss why this cycle is important. We will cover how to prepare your washer. Then we will walk through the steps to run the Tub Clean cycle. We will also talk about the best cleaning products to use. Finally, we will share tips for frequent use and troubleshooting. Let us get your LG washer sparkling clean and fresh.

### Takeaway

*   Run the LG Tub Clean cycle monthly to prevent odors and residue.
*   Always empty the washer and clean the dispenser drawer before starting.
*   Use bleach, white vinegar, or a specialized washer cleaner during the cycle.

To use the Tub Clean cycle on an LG washer, select the Tub Clean setting, add a cleaning agent directly to the detergent dispenser or drum, and then start the cycle. This process helps remove mold, mildew, and detergent residue from the washer drum and internal components.

## Understanding Your LG Washer's Tub Clean Cycle

Your LG washer works hard to clean your clothes. Over time, dirt, detergent, and fabric softener residues can build up inside the drum and other parts. This buildup creates a film where mold and mildew can grow. This growth causes bad smells. It also makes your laundry less clean.

The Tub Clean cycle specifically addresses this problem. It uses higher water levels and faster spin speeds. This combination helps flush out grime and sanitize the washer's interior. This cycle reaches areas you cannot easily wipe by hand. It ensures a deep clean for the entire system.

Think of it as a self-cleaning feature for your appliance. Running this cycle regularly is key for washer health. It keeps your clothes smelling fresh. It also helps your washer last longer. This cycle removes hidden dirt that causes issues.

## Why Your LG Washer Needs Regular Tub Cleaning

Your washing machine is a humid environment. It handles dirty clothes often. These conditions are perfect for mold and mildew growth. Detergent residue and fabric softener also stick to the drum. This creates a food source for bacteria and fungi.

Over time, this buildup leads to bad smells. The odors transfer to your clean laundry. You might notice dark spots on your clothes. This indicates mold has spread from the washer. Regular cleaning prevents these issues.

A dirty washer can also leave soap scum on your clothes. This makes them feel stiff. It can also cause skin irritation for some people. Cleaning your LG washer maintains its efficiency. It ensures your clothes come out truly clean and fresh. Skipping this step can lead to costly repairs later.

## Preparing Your LG Washer for a Deep Clean

Before you start the Tub Clean cycle, prepare your washer properly. This step helps the cleaning process work best. First, make sure the washer drum is completely empty. There should be no clothes or other items inside.

Next, clean the dispenser drawer. This drawer often collects leftover detergent and softener. Pull out the drawer. Rinse it under warm water. Use a small brush to scrub away any sticky residue. Some drawers are removable for easier cleaning.

For front-load LG washers, pay attention to the rubber gasket around the door. This area traps moisture, lint, and grime. Wipe it thoroughly with a damp cloth. You might find dark, slimy buildup here. Getting rid of this improves cleaning and prevents future mold growth. Learning [how to clean a front load washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-front-load-washer) includes specific attention to this gasket. Completing these quick preparation steps will make the Tub Clean cycle more effective. This ensures a truly clean machine.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Running the Tub Clean Cycle on LG Washers

Running the Tub Clean cycle on your LG washer is simple. First, ensure the washer is empty and ready. You have already prepared the dispenser drawer and door gasket. Now you can start the cycle.

Locate the "Tub Clean" setting on your washer's control panel. It may also be called "Clean Washer," "Sanitize," or "Drum Clean." This button is often near the cycle selection knob or part of the digital display. Once you find it, select this cycle.

Next, add your chosen cleaning agent. You can put liquid bleach directly into the liquid bleach dispenser. If you use white vinegar or a washer cleaning tablet, add it directly to the washer drum. Do not put clothes in the washer when you do this. Close the washer door firmly. Press the "Start/Pause" button to begin the cycle. The washer will fill, agitate, soak, and drain. It will do this several times. Let the cycle finish completely. Do not open the door during the process.

### Choosing the Best Cleaning Agent for Your Tub Clean Cycle

You have several good options for cleaning agents. Each works well for the Tub Clean cycle. The best choice depends on your preference and what you have. Always choose one agent; do not mix them. Mixing chemicals can create dangerous fumes.

One common choice is **liquid chlorine bleach**. Use about half a cup (120 ml) of liquid bleach. Pour it into the bleach dispenser. Bleach is excellent for killing mold and mildew. It also sanitizes the drum effectively. Make sure to use regular bleach, not color-safe bleach. For detailed tips on using bleach to clean, you can refer to [how to clean tub with bleach](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-tub-with-bleach).

Another popular and natural option is **distilled white vinegar**. Pour two cups (480 ml) of white vinegar directly into the drum. Vinegar is good for dissolving mineral buildup and soap scum. It also helps remove odors naturally. It is a gentler option than bleach. If you are interested in using vinegar more for cleaning, check out [how to clean washer with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-with-vinegar).

Specialized washing machine cleaners are also available. These often come as tablets or powders. You place them directly into the drum. Follow the product instructions for the correct amount. These cleaners are formulated to tackle washer grime and odors effectively. Always read the label.

## Optimal Frequency and Best Practices for LG Washer Maintenance

Knowing how often to use the Tub Clean cycle is important. Most manufacturers, including LG, suggest running the Tub Clean cycle once a month. This frequency is a good general guideline. It helps prevent buildup before it becomes a major problem. Regular use stops odors from forming. It also ensures your clothes always come out fresh.

However, some factors might change this recommended frequency. If you use your washer very often, like daily, consider running the cycle every two to three weeks. If you live in an area with hard water, mineral deposits can build up faster. In this case, more frequent cleaning is beneficial. Using cold water mostly can also contribute to more buildup. Cold water does not dissolve detergents as thoroughly as warm water.

To keep track, you can set a reminder on your phone or calendar. Make it a routine, like the first Sunday of every month. This simple step ensures consistent maintenance. Consistent care helps your LG washer run well.

Beyond the Tub Clean cycle, practice good everyday habits. After each wash, wipe down the door gasket and the inside of the door. This removes moisture and any leftover residue. Leave the washer door ajar when not in use. This allows air to circulate inside the drum. It helps the interior dry out. Airflow prevents mold and mildew from growing. Always use the correct amount of high-efficiency (HE) detergent. Too much detergent creates excessive suds and residue. This adds to buildup. Following these practices extends the life of your LG washer. It keeps your laundry looking and smelling its best.

## Troubleshooting and Common Questions After Using Tub Clean

Sometimes, even after running the Tub Clean cycle, you might have questions or notice issues. It is normal to seek solutions. Let us discuss common scenarios.

First, if you run the Tub Clean cycle but a smell still lingers, do not worry. This can happen with very stubborn buildup. You may need to run the cycle a second time. Try using a different cleaning agent on the second run. If you used bleach first, try vinegar next. If the smell persists, manually clean specific areas. Pay extra attention to the detergent dispenser and the rubber gasket. A small brush can help reach tight spots. Ensure no standing water remains in any crevices.

If your washer displays an error code during the Tub Clean cycle, consult your LG washer manual. Error codes point to specific problems. Common issues might be related to water supply, drainage, or an unbalanced load. Make sure water supply hoses are open. Check the drain hose for kinks. A clogged drain can also cause issues. In some cases, resetting the washer by unplugging it for a few minutes can clear minor errors.

You might wonder if the Tub Clean cycle is on all LG washer models. Most modern LG washers have this feature. However, older models might not. Check your specific washer's user manual. It will confirm if your model has the cycle and how to activate it. The manual also provides details specific to your washer type, whether it is a front-load or a top-load. Different LG washer models, such as [LG top-load washers](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-lg-top-load-washer), may have slightly varied instructions. Always refer to your product manual first. If problems continue, contact LG customer support for expert help. They can offer model-specific advice.
