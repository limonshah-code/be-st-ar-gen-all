## How to Clean Your Snake Bites Piercing Right

Getting a new piercing is exciting. Snake bites piercings, positioned on each side of your lower lip, look striking. Proper cleaning is key for healing. If you do not clean your snake bites piercing correctly, it can get infected. This guide helps you understand exactly how to clean your new lip piercings. We will discuss the right tools and methods. You will learn about common mistakes and how to avoid them. Taking care of your piercing helps it heal well. I want you to have a safe and smooth healing process.

### Takeaway

*   **Clean with Saline:** Use sterile saline solution two times a day.
*   **Wash Hands First:** Always wash your hands before touching your piercing.
*   **Avoid Touching:** Do not touch or play with your piercing.
*   **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to help healing.
*   **Watch for Signs:** Look for redness, swelling, or discharge.

### How do you properly clean a snake bites piercing for optimal healing?

To clean your snake bites piercing, use a sterile saline solution. Gently spray or soak the piercing two times a day. Do not use harsh chemicals. Avoid touching the piercing with unwashed hands. Follow your piercer's specific aftercare instructions. This helps prevent infection and promotes quick healing.

## Understanding Your New Snake Bites Piercing

You just got snake bites piercings. These are two distinct piercings on your lower lip. They sit symmetrically, one on each side. The initial jewelry is often a labret stud. This stud has a flat back inside your mouth. The front piece can be a ball or a disc. Understanding the placement helps with cleaning. You need to clean both the outside and the inside of your lip. The piercing channels go through your lip tissue. This area heals faster than some other body parts. However, the mouth contains many bacteria. This makes proper cleaning even more important.

Lip piercings like snake bites can swell at first. This is a normal body reaction. Your piercer likely used a longer bar to allow for this swelling. Do not change this jewelry early. Early jewelry changes can cause irritation. They can also introduce bacteria. The healing time for snake bites piercings usually ranges from 6 to 10 weeks. Some people might take longer to heal. Everyone's body heals differently. Follow all aftercare advice during this time. Consistency is vital for a good outcome.

The type of metal in your jewelry matters for healing. High-quality, implant-grade materials are best. These include titanium, surgical stainless steel, or niobium. Your piercer chooses safe materials. Avoid cheap metals during the healing phase. These metals can cause allergic reactions. They can also hinder the healing process. Pay attention to how your body reacts to the jewelry. Report any issues to your piercer right away.

## Essential Supplies for Cleaning Snake Bites Piercings

Having the right cleaning supplies simplifies aftercare. You do not need many items. Simple is better for new piercings. The most important product is sterile saline solution. This solution contains only purified water and salt. It matches your body's natural fluids. This makes it gentle on healing tissue. You can buy pre-made saline sprays. These sprays are convenient and sterile. Make sure the spray is non-aerosol. An aerosol spray can push too much pressure onto your piercing.

Do not use homemade salt water. It is hard to get the salt-to-water ratio correct. Too much salt can dry out your piercing. Too little salt makes the solution ineffective. Homemade solutions are also not sterile. This means they can introduce bacteria. Always opt for a commercially prepared, sterile saline solution. Look for labels that say "wound wash" or "piercing aftercare." These products are safe for your new snake bites. You can find these at pharmacies or piercing shops.

Besides saline, you will need a few other items. Clean paper towels are useful for drying. Avoid cloth towels. Cloth towels can harbor bacteria. They can also snag on your jewelry. A soft-bristled toothbrush is also helpful. Use a new toothbrush for oral hygiene during healing. This helps keep your mouth clean. Make sure your hands are clean. Always wash your hands with antibacterial soap before touching your piercing. This prevents germ transfer.

*   **Sterile Saline Solution:** Pre-made sprays are best.
*   **Clean Paper Towels:** For gentle drying.
*   **Antibacterial Soap:** For hand washing.
*   **New Soft Toothbrush:** For oral hygiene.
*   **Good Oral Rinse (Alcohol-Free):** For mouth cleaning.

Remember, less is often more when it comes to piercing aftercare. Do not use any harsh chemicals. These include alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or strong antiseptic washes. These products can damage new skin cells. They prolong healing time. They can also cause irritation. Stick to the basics for the best results.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Clean Your Snake Bites Piercing

Cleaning your snake bites piercing is simple but requires consistency. I will walk you through each step. Perform this cleaning routine two times a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening. This routine helps prevent infection and promotes healing. It also removes any crust or debris.

First, wash your hands thoroughly. Use antibacterial soap and warm water. Lather up for at least 20 seconds. Rinse your hands completely. This step is crucial. Dirty hands are the biggest cause of piercing infections. Do not skip this step. My piercer always stressed this point.

Next, prepare your sterile saline solution. If you have a spray, simply aim it at the piercing. Spray the outside and inside of each piercing. Make sure the solution saturates the area. If you have a bottle of saline, you can soak a clean paper towel. Gently apply the soaked paper towel to the piercing. Hold it there for a few minutes. This softens any dried discharge.

After soaking, gently remove any softened crust. Do this with a clean, damp paper towel. Do not pick at the crust with your fingernails. Do not rotate or twist your jewelry. Moving the jewelry can irritate the piercing channel. It can also disrupt the healing skin. Let the saline do the work. The goal is to clean, not to agitate.

Finally, dry the area. Gently pat the piercing dry with a fresh paper towel. Make sure the area is completely dry. Moisture can harbor bacteria. It can also lead to skin irritation. Do not use cotton balls or Q-tips. Fibers from these can get caught in the jewelry. This can cause more irritation. This whole process should be gentle and quick. Repeat these steps for both snake bites piercings.

### Inside Mouth Cleaning

Cleaning the inside of your mouth is also vital. After cleaning the outside, focus on the oral cavity. Rinse your mouth with an alcohol-free mouthwash. Do this after every meal and snack. This helps remove food particles. Food particles can get trapped around the internal jewelry. They can cause bacterial buildup. An alcohol-free mouthwash is important. Alcohol can dry out your mouth. It can irritate your piercing.

Many piercers recommend a specific oral rinse. Ask your piercer for a good recommendation. Some people use a diluted saline rinse for the inside of the mouth too. Just swish it around gently. Do not rinse too aggressively. Avoid eating spicy, acidic, or very hot foods during healing. These foods can irritate your new piercings. They can cause pain and prolong healing.

Brush your teeth carefully. Use a new, soft-bristled toothbrush. Brush around your piercing gently. Avoid hitting the jewelry. Good oral hygiene prevents bacterial growth. It keeps your mouth healthy. A healthy mouth helps your piercing heal better. Maintaining good oral hygiene is like cleaning any other mouth piercing, such as [how to clean your septum piercing](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-your-septum-piercing).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid During Healing

Making mistakes during snake bites piercing aftercare can lead to problems. I see many people make the same errors. Avoiding these issues helps your piercing heal smoothly. One big mistake is over-cleaning your piercing. Cleaning too often can irritate the skin. It can also dry out the piercing. Stick to the recommended twice-daily cleaning schedule. More is not always better for healing.

Another common error is using the wrong cleaning products. I mentioned this before, but it bears repeating. Never use harsh chemicals on your piercing. This includes rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or Dettol. These agents are too strong. They kill healthy cells needed for healing. They can cause chemical burns. They also significantly delay the healing process. Trust sterile saline solution. It is the safest choice.

Touching your piercing with dirty hands is a major no-no. Your hands carry many germs. Every time you touch your piercing without washing your hands, you introduce bacteria. This greatly increases the risk of infection. Do not play with your jewelry. Do not twist it. Do not push it. Leave it alone as much as possible. This hands-off approach truly helps your body heal itself.

Changing your jewelry too soon is another frequent mistake. Your piercer put in a longer bar. This bar allows for initial swelling. Removing it before your piercing is healed can damage the channel. It can also trap bacteria inside. This makes infection likely. Wait until your piercer gives you the okay to change jewelry. This is usually after the initial healing period. For more details on safe jewelry changes, consider learning [how to clean piercing jewelry before putting it in](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-piercing-jewelry-before-putting-it-in).

Finally, neglecting oral hygiene is a significant risk. Snake bites piercings are in your mouth. Your mouth is full of bacteria. Not rinsing after meals allows food particles to collect. These particles become breeding grounds for germs. Always rinse your mouth. Choose an alcohol-free mouthwash. A consistent oral hygiene routine is just as important as external cleaning.

## Signs of Infection and When to Seek Help

Even with the best care, sometimes issues happen. It is important to know the signs of an infected snake bites piercing. Early detection helps for quick treatment. Normal healing involves some redness and mild swelling. You might see a clear or whitish discharge. This discharge is lymph fluid. It is part of the healing process. It will dry and form a crust. This is normal.

Signs of infection are different. Look for increased redness around the piercing. The area might feel hot to the touch. Swelling often increases significantly. You might feel throbbing pain. This pain is usually constant and severe. Green or dark yellow pus is a clear sign of infection. This pus is thicker than normal lymph fluid. It often has a foul odor. If you see these signs, act quickly.

Fever and chills are systemic signs. They mean your body is fighting a serious infection. If you develop a fever along with piercing symptoms, see a doctor immediately. Red streaks extending from the piercing site are also a serious sign. These streaks can indicate cellulitis. This is a spreading bacterial skin infection. Do not ignore these symptoms.

If you suspect an infection, do not remove the jewelry. Removing the jewelry can trap the infection inside the piercing channel. This makes it harder for the infection to drain. It can lead to an abscess. Continue to clean your piercing with saline solution. This helps keep the area clean.

Contact your piercer first. They can offer advice. They can tell you if you need to see a doctor. They have experience with many piercing issues. If your piercer advises it, or if symptoms worsen, see a doctor. A doctor can prescribe antibiotics if needed. Timely treatment helps prevent serious complications. Remember, your health is most important. Knowing when to get professional help protects your new piercing and your overall well-being. This advice applies to all piercings, including cleaning other body piercings like [how to clean a dermal piercing](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-dermal-piercing).

## Lifestyle Adjustments for Optimal Healing

Your daily habits affect how well your snake bites piercings heal. Some lifestyle changes promote faster healing. Others can hinder it. Think about what you eat and drink. Spicy foods, very hot foods, and acidic foods can irritate new piercings. Avoid them during the initial healing period. This means no hot peppers, no citrus, and no extremely hot coffee. Stick to bland, soft foods. Cold drinks or ice chips can help reduce swelling.

Smoking and alcohol consumption are bad for healing piercings. Smoking introduces harmful chemicals into your mouth. It dries out the oral cavity. This increases the risk of infection. Alcohol thins your blood. This can lead to increased bleeding. It also dehydrates your body. Try to avoid both, or at least cut back significantly, during the healing phase. Your body needs to focus its energy on healing.

Stress also plays a role in healing. High stress levels can suppress your immune system. A weaker immune system makes you more vulnerable to infection. Try to reduce stress. Get enough sleep. Eat a balanced diet. Staying hydrated is also crucial. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Water helps flush toxins. It keeps your tissues healthy. Hydration supports overall healing processes.

Avoid activities that put pressure on your lip. This includes kissing or any oral contact. These activities can introduce bacteria. They can also snag your jewelry. Be careful when eating. Small bites are best. Chew slowly. Avoid contact sports where your face might get hit. A blow to the lip can rip out the piercing. This causes serious damage.

Consider your dental habits. Brush your teeth gently twice a day. Use an alcohol-free mouthwash after meals. This keeps your mouth clean. Oral hygiene is non-negotiable for lip piercings. If you wear lipstick or lip gloss, avoid applying it near the piercing. These products can get into the piercing channel. They can cause irritation or infection. Wait until your piercing is fully healed before using makeup on your lips. Consistent good habits help your snake bites heal faster and better.

## Long-Term Care and Jewelry Choices

Once your snake bites piercings are fully healed, long-term care becomes simpler. You can reduce cleaning frequency to once a day. Or you can clean as needed. Continue to maintain good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth regularly. Use an alcohol-free mouthwash. Even healed piercings can get irritated. A healthy mouth helps keep your piercings trouble-free. My own piercings feel better when I maintain a good cleaning routine.

Jewelry choices are more varied after healing. You can experiment with different styles. Labret studs are still common. You can also try seamless rings or circular barbells. Ensure any new jewelry is of high quality. Implant-grade materials like titanium or surgical stainless steel are always safe bets. Avoid low-quality metals. These can cause irritation or allergic reactions over time. Some people develop sensitivity to certain metals. If a new piece of jewelry causes irritation, remove it. Clean the piercing and replace it with a known safe material. You can learn more about [how to clean piercing jewelry](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-piercing-jewelry).

Consider the fit of your jewelry. After initial swelling reduces, your piercer might suggest downsizing the post. This means replacing the long bar with a shorter one. A shorter bar reduces irritation. It prevents the jewelry from snagging. It also sits more comfortably against your gums and teeth. Overly long jewelry can rub against your teeth. This can cause enamel damage or gum recession. Regular check-ups with your piercer are a good idea. They can assess your piercing's health. They can help with jewelry changes.

Be aware of signs of irritation even years after healing. Sometimes, piercings can become irritated due to trauma. This can be from bumping it or snagging it. Irritation can also come from poor quality jewelry. If your piercing feels sore or looks red, go back to basic aftercare. Clean it with saline solution. Avoid touching it. If irritation persists, contact your piercer. They can help diagnose the issue. Taking care of your piercings long-term means they will last for years.

## Troubleshooting Common Snake Bites Piercing Issues

Even with good care, you might encounter minor issues. Knowing how to deal with them helps. One common problem is irritation bumps. These are small, red bumps near the piercing site. They can happen from trauma, like snagging the jewelry. They can also form from using harsh cleaners. Or they can come from constantly playing with the jewelry.

If you get an irritation bump, do not panic. Do not try to pop it. Continue your regular cleaning with sterile saline solution. Avoid touching the bump. Make sure your jewelry is not too tight. Sometimes, downsizing the post can help if the current one is too long. If the bump does not go away, see your piercer. They can offer specific advice.

Another issue is piercing migration or rejection. Migration means the piercing moves from its original spot. Rejection means your body pushes the jewelry out entirely. Signs include the jewelry visibly moving. The skin over the jewelry might become thin or red. Migration is rare for lip piercings. If you suspect migration or rejection, see your piercer immediately. They can assess the situation. They might suggest removing the jewelry.

Sometimes, a bad odor comes from the piercing. This is often due to bacteria buildup. It can also happen from dead skin cells and body oils. Regular cleaning helps prevent this. Make sure you clean both the inside and outside of the piercing. If the odor persists, and you have signs of infection, seek medical attention.

Remember to be patient. Healing takes time. Some days your piercing might feel fine. Other days it might feel a bit sore. This is part of the process. If you have any concerns, your piercer is your best resource. They are professionals. They want your piercing to heal well. Do not hesitate to contact them. They have seen it all. Always prioritize safe and healthy healing. If you have multiple piercings, like a [snake eyes piercing](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-snake-eyes-piercing), these general troubleshooting tips can apply.
