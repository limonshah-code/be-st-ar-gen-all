## How To Clean Pennies That Are Corroded

Have you ever found an old penny, maybe in a forgotten jar or buried in the garden? It likely looks dull, dark, or even green. That's corrosion at work. Learning how to clean pennies that are corroded can bring a satisfying shine back to these small pieces of history. I understand the desire to restore these coins. This guide will walk you through safe and effective methods. We will explore various techniques, from gentle soaks to more potent solutions. You will learn to handle different types of corrosion. By the end, you will know how to clean your corroded pennies properly.

### Takeaway: Restore Your Corroded Pennies Carefully

Cleaning corroded pennies involves gentle, measured steps. Avoid harsh abrasion. Focus on chemical reactions that lift corrosion safely.
*   **Assess the Penny:** Determine its age and material to choose the right method.
*   **Start Mild:** Begin with the least abrasive methods like soap and water.
*   **Use Acids Cautiously:** Mild acids are effective but can alter the coin's surface.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** Always rinse pennies completely after cleaning solutions.
*   **Dry Properly:** Ensure pennies are completely dry to prevent future corrosion.

To clean pennies that are corroded, you can use mild acids like vinegar or lemon juice mixed with salt, or gentle methods such as soap and water or olive oil for less severe corrosion. Always proceed with caution to avoid damaging the coin's surface or reducing its potential value.

### Understanding Penny Corrosion and Why It Happens

Pennies, especially older ones, often show signs of corrosion. This happens due to their copper content. Copper reacts with oxygen and moisture in the air. This reaction creates copper oxides and carbonates. These compounds appear as a dull brown or green film on the penny's surface.

Different factors cause different types of corrosion. Humidity speeds up the process. Dirt and grime trapped on the coin also contribute. Sometimes, you see a bright green substance. This is copper carbonate, often called "verdigris." It is a common form of corrosion on copper coins. Understanding why pennies corrode helps us choose the best cleaning method. It also helps us prevent future damage.

Modern pennies, those made after 1982, are mostly zinc with a thin copper plating. When this plating gets scratched, the zinc core is exposed. Zinc corrodes differently than copper. It often forms a white, powdery substance. This can be more aggressive and harder to clean without damaging the penny. Knowing the penny's age helps identify its material. This knowledge is important for proper cleaning. Older, copper pennies need different care than newer, zinc-core pennies. You want to remove the unsightly build-up without stripping the coin's natural patina or causing further damage.

### Safety First: Preparing for Penny Cleaning

Before you start cleaning any corroded pennies, safety must be your top priority. You will be handling various substances. Some of these can irritate your skin or eyes. Always work in a well-ventilated area. This prevents inhaling fumes from cleaning solutions.

Gather all your materials beforehand. This includes your pennies, cleaning solutions, and protective gear. Proper preparation makes the cleaning process smoother and safer. It also helps you avoid mistakes. Taking a moment to prepare means you can focus on the task.

Here are essential safety precautions to follow:

*   **Wear Gloves:** Use rubber or latex gloves. They protect your skin from acids and other chemicals. They also prevent natural oils from your hands from transferring to the coin.
*   **Protect Your Work Surface:** Lay down old newspapers, paper towels, or a plastic sheet. This protects your table or countertop from spills and stains.
*   **Good Ventilation:** Open a window or work near a fan. This is especially important when using acidic solutions like vinegar or lemon juice.
*   **Eye Protection:** Consider wearing safety glasses. Splashes can happen unexpectedly. Protecting your eyes is very important.
*   **Keep Solutions Away from Children and Pets:** Store all cleaning agents safely. Ensure they are out of reach.

Always read labels on any commercial cleaning products. Follow their specific safety instructions. For natural remedies, common sense precautions are usually enough. Once you have prepared your workspace, you are ready to begin. Safety measures ensure a positive cleaning experience.

### Gentle Cleaning Methods for Mild Corrosion

Not all corroded pennies require harsh chemicals. For pennies with light tarnish or minor dirt, gentle cleaning methods are often effective. These methods are less likely to damage the coin's surface. They are also safer for you and the environment. I always start with the least aggressive approach. This helps preserve the coin's natural state.

One simple and effective method uses just soap and water. You can try this for everyday dirt and light brown tarnish. It is a good first step before trying stronger solutions. This method will not remove heavy green corrosion. However, it can reveal if a penny is salvageable with mild efforts.

Steps for gentle cleaning:

*   **Warm Soapy Water Soak:** Fill a small bowl with warm water. Add a few drops of mild dish soap. Place your corroded pennies in the soapy water. Let them soak for 15-30 minutes. The soap helps loosen dirt and grime.
*   **Gentle Scrubbing:** After soaking, remove one penny. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush or a cotton swab. Gently scrub the coin's surface. Focus on areas with tarnish. Do not scrub too hard, especially on older or delicate coins. You want to remove only the loose debris.
*   **Rinse and Dry:** Rinse the penny thoroughly under cool running water. Ensure all soap residue is gone. Pat the penny dry with a soft, lint-free cloth. Air dry completely before storing.

Another surprisingly effective method for mild corrosion is olive oil. This method is slow but very gentle. It can work well for older, valued pennies. Olive oil helps loosen dirt and can even improve the coin's appearance over time. This process is about patience.

To use olive oil:

*   **Soak in Olive Oil:** Place your corroded pennies in a small container. Cover them completely with olive oil.
*   **Long Soak Time:** Let the pennies soak for several days, or even weeks. Check on them periodically. The oil slowly penetrates and loosens the corrosion.
*   **Wipe Clean:** After soaking, remove the pennies. Gently wipe them with a soft cloth. The corrosion should come off more easily. You may need to repeat the process.

These gentle methods prioritize the coin's integrity. They are ideal for pennies with light corrosion or for those you want to handle with extreme care. Remember, you can always try a stronger method if these do not work.

### Acidic Solutions for Stubborn Corrosion

Sometimes, gentle methods are not enough for deeply corroded pennies. For more stubborn tarnish and green build-up, mild acidic solutions are often necessary. These solutions react with the copper oxides and carbonates. They help dissolve the corrosion. However, use these methods with caution. Acids can be harsh on the coin's surface. They can also strip away desirable patina if used improperly. For specific guidance on using vinegar, you can refer to our article on [how to clean pennies with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pennies-with-vinegar).

One popular and effective solution is vinegar and salt. The acid in vinegar, combined with the abrasive action of salt, works wonders on copper corrosion. This is a common household remedy. I have seen it bring many dull pennies back to life.

Steps for vinegar and salt:

*   **Prepare Solution:** Pour about half a cup of white vinegar into a small bowl. Add a teaspoon of table salt. Stir until the salt dissolves.
*   **Soak Pennies:** Place your corroded pennies into the solution. Ensure they are fully submerged. Watch them carefully. You will often see the corrosion beginning to fizz and disappear.
*   **Monitor Soaking Time:** Soak for a few minutes. For heavily corroded pennies, you might need 10-15 minutes. Do not leave them too long. Prolonged exposure can make the penny too shiny or even damage the surface.
*   **Rinse and Dry:** Remove the pennies using non-metal tweezers. Rinse them thoroughly under cool water. Gently rub them with your fingers to remove any remaining residue. Dry completely with a soft cloth.

Lemon juice is another excellent option. It contains citric acid, which is also effective against copper corrosion. It works similarly to vinegar. I find it leaves a pleasant, fresh scent. This method is generally safe for copper pennies.

To use lemon juice:

*   **Prepare Solution:** Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into a bowl. Add half a teaspoon of salt. Mix well.
*   **Soak and Scrub:** Place pennies in the lemon juice solution. Let them soak for a few minutes. For tough spots, you can gently rub the penny with a cotton swab dipped in the solution.
*   **Rinse and Dry:** Rinse pennies under cool water. Make sure all lemon juice and salt are gone. Dry thoroughly.

When using any acidic cleaner, remember that the goal is to remove corrosion, not to make the penny look brand new. A super shiny penny might look appealing. However, it can indicate that the natural patina has been removed. This can sometimes reduce a coin's collector value. If you are concerned about preserving the coin's value, it's worth reading more about [how to clean old pennies without devaluing them](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-old-pennies-without-devaluing-them). Always use these solutions with care.

### Mechanical Methods: When and How to Use Them

Mechanical cleaning involves physically removing corrosion from the penny's surface. This can include light scraping or gentle rubbing with tools. These methods are generally more aggressive. They should be used only when chemical solutions have failed. It is very easy to scratch or damage a penny with mechanical tools. I use these methods as a last resort. For broader insights into cleaning various metals, you might find our article on [how to clean corroded metal](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-corroded-metal) helpful, as some principles apply.

When considering mechanical cleaning, think about the penny's value and condition. A common, heavily corroded penny might benefit from careful mechanical cleaning. A rare or valuable coin should never be mechanically cleaned by an amateur. You risk permanent damage. Always prioritize the coin's integrity over achieving perfect shininess.

Here are some tools and techniques for careful mechanical cleaning:

*   **Wooden Toothpicks:** A wooden toothpick is perhaps the safest tool for mechanical cleaning. It is softer than metal. It is less likely to scratch the coin.
    *   **Technique:** After soaking the penny in a solution (like olive oil or a mild acid), use the tip of a wooden toothpick. Gently pick at stubborn bits of corrosion. Work slowly and carefully. Avoid pressing too hard. This method is good for removing isolated specks of green corrosion.
*   **Cotton Swabs:** Cotton swabs are excellent for applying solutions and for gentle rubbing. They are non-abrasive.
    *   **Technique:** Dip a cotton swab in a mild cleaning solution. Gently rub the corroded areas. The cotton can lift away softened corrosion. This is effective for light surface grime.
*   **Soft Brushes (Extremely Fine Bristle):** In some cases, an extremely soft brush, like a soft artist's brush or even a baby toothbrush, can be used. This should be done with extreme caution.
    *   **Technique:** Use the brush very lightly after the penny has been soaked. The goal is to dislodge softened corrosion, not to scrub the coin. Always use a gentle circular motion. Rinse frequently.

Never use metal brushes, steel wool, or abrasive pads on pennies. These will cause irreversible scratches. These scratches will ruin the coin's surface. They will also significantly devalue it. Remember, the goal is restoration, not destruction. Mechanical methods require patience and a very light touch. If you are unsure, it is better to stick to chemical solutions or consult a coin expert.

### Special Cases: Steel Pennies and Green Corrosion

Some pennies present unique cleaning challenges. Steel pennies from 1943 are one such example. They were made of steel with a thin zinc coating. This was due to copper shortages during World War II. These pennies corrode very differently from copper pennies. Their steel core rusts when exposed to moisture. This creates a reddish-brown rust. Cleaning these requires a specific approach. For detailed information, our article on [how to clean 1943 steel pennies](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-1943-steel-pennies) is a great resource.

When cleaning 1943 steel pennies:

*   **Avoid Acids:** Acids like vinegar or lemon juice will quickly strip the zinc coating. This exposes the steel core to further rust. Do not use these on steel pennies.
*   **Use Mild Detergents:** Soaking in warm, soapy water is the safest first step. Gently rub with a soft cloth.
*   **Baking Soda Paste (Caution):** For light rust, a paste of baking soda and water can sometimes help. Apply gently. Rub with a soft cloth. Rinse immediately and dry thoroughly. Be aware that this can still be abrasive.
*   **Mineral Oil:** Soaking a steel penny in mineral oil can help loosen rust. It also provides a protective barrier after cleaning.

Green corrosion, or verdigris, is a common problem on copper pennies. It often indicates active copper carbonate formation. This green layer can be thick and stubborn. It also continues to eat into the metal. Removing it is important for the coin's preservation. Our guide on [how to clean green pennies](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-green-pennies) offers more insights.

When tackling green corrosion:

*   **Prolonged Soaks:** Longer soaks in mild acids like vinegar or lemon juice may be needed. Check the penny frequently.
*   **Baking Soda Paste (Acid Neutralization):** After an acid soak, a baking soda paste can help neutralize any remaining acid. Make a paste with baking soda and water. Apply it to the coin. Gently rub. Rinse thoroughly. This is crucial to stop the acidic reaction.
*   **Patience:** Green corrosion can be very persistent. You might need multiple cycles of soaking and gentle scrubbing. Do not rush the process.
*   **Consider Professional Help:** If the green corrosion is very severe and you suspect the penny might be valuable, consider consulting a professional coin conservator. Aggressive cleaning can significantly damage numismatic value.

Cleaning special types of pennies or specific types of corrosion requires understanding the underlying chemistry. This prevents further damage. Remember, preservation is key.

### Post-Cleaning Care and Preservation

Cleaning your corroded pennies is only half the battle. Proper post-cleaning care and preservation are crucial. This ensures your restored pennies remain clean and do not corrode again quickly. Skipping these steps can lead to immediate re-tarnishing or new damage. I always make sure pennies are completely ready for storage.

The most important step after cleaning is thorough drying. Any residual moisture will cause new corrosion. Water spots can also form. These are often harder to remove than the original corrosion.

Steps for proper drying:

*   **Immediate Rinse:** After cleaning, rinse the penny immediately and thoroughly under cool, clean water. Remove all traces of the cleaning solution.
*   **Soft Cloth Drying:** Gently pat the penny dry with a soft, lint-free cloth. Microfiber cloths work well. Avoid rubbing vigorously, which can cause scratches.
*   **Air Drying:** Place the penny on a clean, dry paper towel or cloth. Allow it to air dry completely for several hours. You can even place it in a low-humidity environment. This ensures all moisture, including from tiny crevices, has evaporated. Some people use a hairdryer on a low, cool setting for a few seconds. This can help speed up the process.

Once your pennies are completely dry, proper storage is essential. Exposure to air and humidity causes corrosion. Limiting this exposure protects your coins. For further information on preserving various types of coins, you might find our article on [how to clean corroded coins](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-corroded-coins) useful.

Effective storage methods include:

*   **Coin Flips:** Mylar coin flips are common and affordable. They create an airtight seal around the penny. Avoid PVC flips, as they can degrade and damage coins over time.
*   **Coin Holders:** Cardboard coin holders with Mylar windows offer good protection. Staple them closed.
*   **Slabs/Graded Holders:** For valuable coins, professional grading services encapsulate them in sealed, inert plastic slabs. This offers the best protection.
*   **Dry Environment:** Store your cleaned pennies in a cool, dry place. Avoid basements or attics, which often have high humidity. Consider using silica gel packets in storage boxes to absorb moisture.

By following these post-cleaning and preservation steps, you significantly extend the life and appearance of your cleaned pennies. You prevent future corrosion. This ensures your efforts are long-lasting. Proper care is an investment in the coin's future.

### Restoring Value and Appearance

Cleaning corroded pennies aims to improve their appearance. It can also help reveal hidden details. Sometimes, corrosion covers up important mint marks or dates. Removing the corrosion can make a coin identifiable or more attractive. However, restoring appearance is different from restoring numismatic value. In many cases, cleaning a coin, especially an old or rare one, can decrease its collector value. Coin collectors often prefer coins with their original "patina," which is a natural layer of oxidation that develops over time.

A natural patina is a stable layer. It protects the coin from further corrosion. It also shows the coin's age. Removing this patina can be seen as damaging the coin's history. This is why many coin collecting guides advise against cleaning valuable coins. If you suspect a penny might be rare or hold significant value, it is best to consult with a professional numismatist. They can advise on the best course of action. They may also clean it professionally.

For common, everyday pennies, the focus is purely aesthetic. I often clean these just for fun. It is satisfying to see a dull, corroded penny transform. These pennies do not hold significant monetary value. Their appearance is what matters most. Cleaning them allows them to be used in crafts or simply to look nicer in your coin jar.

Different cleaning methods can have different effects on the penny's appearance:

*   **Gentle Methods:** Soap and water, or olive oil, will largely preserve the existing patina. They remove only loose dirt and light tarnish. The penny will look cleaner but still retain its aged look.
*   **Acidic Solutions:** Vinegar, lemon juice, or ketchup can make pennies look very bright and shiny. This is often called "acid dipping." It effectively removes corrosion. However, it also removes the natural patina. The penny will look almost new. Some people prefer this look. Others find it unnatural for an old coin.
*   **Mechanical Methods:** These methods can also remove patina. They also carry a high risk of scratching the coin's surface. Scratches are permanent damage. They severely reduce a coin's appeal and value.

Ultimately, the choice to clean a corroded penny depends on your goal. Are you trying to improve its appearance for personal satisfaction? Or are you hoping to uncover a valuable rarity? For the latter, extreme caution is necessary. For the former, cleaning can be a rewarding experience.
