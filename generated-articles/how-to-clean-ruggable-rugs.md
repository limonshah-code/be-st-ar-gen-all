This article gives you practical steps for every cleaning need.

### How do you clean Ruggable rugs?

You clean Ruggable rugs by detaching the rug cover from its pad. Then, you machine wash the rug cover in cold water with mild detergent. You can tumble dry on low or air dry it. For spills, you should spot clean promptly.

## Understanding Ruggable Rugs: Their Unique Design

Ruggable rugs are different from traditional rugs. They come in two parts. One part is a decorative, washable rug cover. The other part is a non-slip rug pad. This two-part system makes Ruggable rugs very convenient. You can easily remove the top layer for washing. This design solves common rug cleaning problems.

The rug cover attaches to the rug pad with a patented Cling Effect™ technology. This keeps the rug from moving. It also makes it easy to detach the cover. When it is time to clean, you just peel off the top layer. This innovation changed how we think about washable rugs. It means you no longer need to pay for professional rug cleaning. You can handle most messes at home. This saves you time and money. Understanding this design is key to cleaning your Ruggable rug effectively.

## Routine Care for Ruggable Rugs: Daily and Weekly Tasks

Routine care helps keep your Ruggable rug fresh. This also extends its life. Daily or weekly habits make a big difference. You do not need to wash the rug cover every week. Simple steps can keep it looking good. I find that regular light cleaning prevents dirt buildup.

First, vacuum your Ruggable rug cover regularly. Use a low-suction setting on your vacuum cleaner. Do not use a beater bar or a powerful rotating brush. These can damage the rug fibers. Gently vacuuming picks up loose dirt and pet hair. This is especially important for high-traffic areas. I vacuum my living room Ruggable every few days. This keeps it from looking dingy.

Second, shake out smaller Ruggable rugs outdoors. If you have a runner or a small area rug, take it outside. Give it a good shake to remove dust and crumbs. This is a quick way to freshen it up. It also helps remove any trapped debris that vacuuming might miss. This simple step can make your rug feel much cleaner. Consistent routine care means less effort when it is time for a full wash.

## Tackling Spills and Stains on Your Ruggable Rug

Spills happen. When they do, quick action is important for Ruggable rugs. Do not let spills sit for long. This gives them less time to set into the fibers. I always keep a few cleaning supplies handy for accidents. You want to blot, not rub, spills. Rubbing can spread the stain. It can also push the stain deeper into the rug fibers.

To clean a spill, first, blot up as much liquid as possible. Use a clean, dry cloth or paper towel. Press firmly on the spill. Repeat this step until no more liquid transfers to your cloth. For solid messes, like mud or food, gently scrape them off. Use a spoon or a dull knife. Remove as much of the solid material as you can before applying any cleaner.

Next, make a simple cleaning solution. Mix a small amount of mild, clear dish soap with cold water. You can also use a Ruggable-approved stain remover. Dip a clean cloth into this solution. Gently blot the stained area. Work from the outside of the stain inward. This prevents the stain from spreading. Rinse your cloth and blot again with plain water. This removes any soap residue. Finally, blot the area dry with a clean, dry towel. Allow the rug to air dry completely before walking on it. Always test any cleaning solution on a small, hidden area first. This ensures it does not harm the rug color or material. This method works well for most common spills.

## Machine Washing Your Ruggable Rug Cover: A Step-by-Step Guide

The best way to clean your Ruggable rug is by machine washing the cover. This is what makes Ruggable rugs so convenient. I find this process very straightforward. Following the right steps ensures your rug cover gets clean without damage. This is the core reason people choose Ruggable.

**1. Detach the Rug Cover:** First, peel the rug cover from its pad. Start at one corner and slowly pull it up. The Cling Effect™ technology makes this easy. Do not pull too hard or too fast. Fold the rug cover with the design facing inward. This protects the pattern during washing. For larger rugs, fold it into a manageable size.

**2. Check for Stains and Pre-Treat:** Look for any stubborn stains. If you see some, pre-treat them. Use a mild stain remover approved for washable rugs. Apply a small amount directly to the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes. Do not use bleach or harsh chemicals. These can damage the rug fibers or fade colors. Pre-treating helps lift tough spots before the main wash.

**3. Load into the Washing Machine:** Place the folded rug cover into a large capacity washing machine. It is best to use a front-load or top-load machine without a center agitator. An agitator can be too harsh on the rug. Do not overload your washing machine. The rug cover needs enough space to move freely. This allows for proper cleaning. If you have a very large Ruggable, you might need a commercial-sized washer. You can find these at a laundromat. For more detailed instructions on machine washing your ruggable, you can consult our guide on [how to wash a ruggable](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-wash-a-ruggable).

**4. Add Detergent and Select Cycle:** Use a mild, non-bleach laundry detergent. Liquid detergent works well. Do not use too much detergent. Follow the detergent bottle instructions for a large load. Set your washing machine to the cold water cycle. Choose a delicate or gentle setting. Cold water protects the colors and fibers of your Ruggable rug. Avoid hot water, as it can cause shrinking or fading.

**5. Start the Wash Cycle:** Begin the wash cycle. Let the machine complete the wash and rinse cycles. The gentle cycle ensures the rug cover is cleaned thoroughly but carefully. Once done, proceed to the drying step. Proper washing helps keep your Ruggable rug vibrant and clean for years. This simple process makes rug care easy.

## Drying and Reassembling Your Ruggable Rug

Proper drying is just as important as proper washing for your Ruggable rug. Incorrect drying can cause wrinkles or damage. After washing, I always make sure to dry my Ruggable rug cover carefully. This ensures it looks good and reattaches easily.

**1. Tumble Dry on Low or Air Dry:** You have two main options for drying your Ruggable rug cover. The first is to tumble dry on the lowest heat setting. Use a delicate or air fluff cycle. High heat can damage the rug fibers or cause shrinking. I often throw a few clean bath towels in with the rug cover. This helps absorb moisture faster. Do not over-dry the rug cover. Take it out when it is mostly dry. For more specific washing and drying advice, refer to our comprehensive guide on [how to wash a ruggable](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-wash-a-ruggable).

The second option is to air dry. Hang the rug cover over a clothesline or a sturdy drying rack. Make sure it is spread out evenly. Air drying is gentler on the fabric. It helps prevent any potential shrinking. It also saves energy. This option might take longer, especially in humid conditions. Ensure good air circulation around the rug.

**2. Ensure Complete Dryness:** Before reassembling, ensure the rug cover is completely dry. If it is even slightly damp, it can develop mildew or odors. Feel all parts of the rug cover. Pay attention to thicker areas or seams. They might hold moisture longer. If you are drying indoors, use a fan to speed up the process. A fully dry rug cover is essential for longevity and freshness.

**3. Reassemble the Rug:** Once the rug cover is dry, it is time to reattach it to the rug pad. First, lay the rug pad flat on the floor in your desired location. Smooth out any wrinkles. Then, align one edge of the rug cover with one edge of the rug pad. Slowly unroll or unfold the rug cover. Press it down onto the pad as you go. Work your way across the rug, smoothing out any air bubbles or wrinkles. The Cling Effect™ technology will reattach the cover securely. Take your time to get it right. A smooth reattachment helps the rug lie flat and look its best.

## Cleaning the Ruggable Rug Pad: Important Considerations

While the rug cover gets most of the cleaning attention, the rug pad needs care too. The pad is not machine washable. It is made of a different material. The good news is that it does not typically get as dirty as the rug cover. You will clean the pad much less often. It still needs occasional maintenance. I always give my pad a quick clean when the cover is in the wash.

To clean the Ruggable rug pad, first, ensure the rug cover is removed. You want a clear surface to work on. Look for any spills or dirt that might have seeped through. Often, the pad just has dust or crumbs on it. You can simply vacuum the rug pad. Use a gentle brush attachment. This picks up any loose debris. Do not use too much suction.

For deeper cleaning, wipe down the rug pad. Use a damp cloth. You can add a small amount of mild soap to the water if needed. A general all-purpose cleaner diluted with water also works well. Do not use harsh chemicals. Avoid strong bleach or abrasive cleaners. These can damage the pad material. Wipe the entire surface of the pad. Pay attention to any spots. Ensure you wipe both sides if possible.

After cleaning, let the rug pad air dry completely. Do not reattach the rug cover until the pad is bone dry. This prevents mildew growth. You can open windows or use a fan to help it dry faster. The pad needs to be completely dry to maintain its non-slip properties. A clean pad ensures your Ruggable rug stays fresh and secure. This simple cleaning step keeps your entire rug system in top condition.

## Special Cleaning Scenarios: Pet Accidents and Deep Cleaning

Sometimes, your Ruggable rug faces tougher challenges. Pet accidents or very deep dirt require specific approaches. These situations need a bit more attention. I have had to deal with both on my Ruggables. Knowing how to handle them makes a big difference.

### Pet Accidents on Ruggable Rugs

Pet accidents are common. The key is to act quickly. First, absorb as much of the liquid as possible. Use old towels or paper towels. Press down firmly to blot the area. Do not rub the mess. Rubbing pushes the urine deeper into the fibers. You want to lift it out.

Next, rinse the affected area with cold water. You can do this by pouring a small amount of water directly on the spot. Then blot again. Repeat this several times. This helps dilute and remove the urine. Then, use an enzymatic pet stain remover. These cleaners break down the odor-causing molecules. Follow the product instructions carefully. Apply the cleaner and let it sit for the recommended time. Blot it dry. After treating the spot, detach the rug cover and machine wash it. Follow the standard washing instructions. The cold water cycle and gentle detergent will help remove any remaining odor or stain. For persistent odors, you might need to repeat the enzymatic cleaner treatment. Also, check the rug pad. If liquid soaked through, clean the pad using the methods discussed earlier. Ensuring the pad is also clean prevents lingering smells.

### Deep Cleaning Your Ruggable Rug

Even with regular washes, your Ruggable rug might need a deep clean sometimes. This is not about getting a specific stain out. It is about refreshing the entire rug. A regular machine wash is usually a deep clean for Ruggables. However, for extremely soiled rugs or those with a built-up dullness, you can adjust your approach slightly.

Consider a pre-soak cycle in your washing machine. This helps loosen heavy dirt before the main wash. You can add a laundry booster designed for colors. Avoid any products with bleach. Use a slightly longer wash cycle if your machine has one, still on cold and gentle settings. Do not add more detergent than recommended. Too much detergent can leave residue.

After washing, pay extra attention during drying. Ensure the rug cover is completely dry. Air drying outdoors on a sunny day can provide extra freshness. This helps air out any lingering odors. For a truly deep refresh, you might even consider washing the rug cover twice. This is rare for Ruggables. Their design makes them very effective with a single wash. But in extreme cases, it is an option. Remember, the simpler you keep the cleaning process, the better. Ruggable rugs are designed for ease of care.

## Maintaining Your Ruggable Rug's Longevity

Keeping your Ruggable rug in great shape involves more than just cleaning. It also involves how you handle it between washes and during reassembly. Proper maintenance helps the rug last longer. I have found a few tricks that extend the life of my Ruggables. These tips keep them looking good for years.

First, rotate your Ruggable rug periodically. If your rug is in a high-traffic area, parts of it might wear down faster. Rotating it every few months evens out the wear. This is similar to rotating car tires. It distributes the foot traffic. This simple step can prevent premature wear in specific spots. It keeps the entire rug looking uniform.

Second, be gentle with the rug cover when attaching and detaching it. While the Cling Effect™ technology is strong, repeated harsh pulling can strain the fibers. Peel it slowly and evenly. When reattaching, smooth it down carefully. Avoid stretching the fabric. Stretching can cause wrinkles or make it harder to align. Gentle handling helps maintain the rug's shape and integrity over time.

Third, store your Ruggable rug properly if you need to put it away. If you are not using it for a while, roll the rug cover. Store it in a cool, dry place. Avoid folding it tightly for long periods. Folding can create permanent creases. Rolling helps the rug maintain its flat shape. Store the rug pad flat if possible, or loosely rolled. Do not store it in direct sunlight or in a damp area. This prevents fading and mildew. By following these simple maintenance tips, your Ruggable rug will remain a beautiful and functional part of your home for many years.

## FAQ Section

### How often should I wash my Ruggable rug?

The frequency depends on use and traffic. For high-traffic areas, or homes with pets and kids, washing every 2-4 weeks is common. For low-traffic areas, every 2-3 months might be enough. Spot clean spills immediately to extend time between full washes. Always wash if there is a noticeable odor or visible dirt.

### Can I use bleach on my Ruggable rug?

No, do not use bleach on your Ruggable rug. Bleach can damage the rug fibers. It can also cause irreversible fading or discoloration. Always use a mild, non-bleach laundry detergent. If you need a stain remover, choose one specifically labeled as color-safe. Test any product on a hidden spot first.

### What if my Ruggable rug doesn't fit in my washer?

If your Ruggable rug is too large for your home washing machine, you have options. Most laundromats have commercial-sized washing machines. These machines are much larger and can accommodate big Ruggable covers. You can also wash larger covers by hand in a bathtub. Use cold water and mild detergent.

### Can you put Ruggable rugs in the dryer?

Yes, you can tumble dry Ruggable rug covers. Use the lowest heat setting or an air fluff cycle. High heat can damage the rug fibers or cause shrinking. It is best to take the rug cover out when it is still slightly damp. Then, let it air dry completely. This helps prevent wrinkles and protects the fabric.

### How do I get wrinkles out of my Ruggable rug?

Wrinkles often happen after washing or reassembling. First, ensure the rug cover is completely dry. Lay the rug flat and smooth it out. If wrinkles remain, they usually flatten over a few days with foot traffic. For stubborn wrinkles, you can try gently steaming the area with a handheld steamer. Keep the steamer moving.
