## Solving Common Clear Touch Screen Issues

First, let's start with basic checks. Many touch issues are simple to fix. Begin by ensuring the screen is clean. Dirt or residue can interfere with touch sensors. Next, try restarting the Clear Touch display. A simple power cycle often resolves temporary software glitches.

### Unresponsive Touch

If your touch screen does not respond, consider these steps. Power down the unit completely. Unplug it from the power source for a few minutes. Then plug it back in and turn it on. This performs a hard reset. Check for any physical obstructions near the bezel. These can sometimes block the IR touch sensors.
