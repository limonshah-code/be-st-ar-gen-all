*   **Code 71 (Combustion Blower Error):** The fan that removes exhaust gases has a problem.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Check for blockages in the exhaust vent. Ensure the blower motor spins freely. This can be a sign of poor air quality or blockages.
*   **Code 90 (Ventilation Blockage):** The vent pipe for exhaust is blocked.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Clear any debris from the vent pipe. Ensure there are no kinks or obstructions. Proper ventilation is critical for safe operation.

If you see an error code, note it down. Then, try resetting the unit. Turn off the power to the heater for a few minutes. Then turn it back on. If the code persists, you can start deeper troubleshooting. Some codes need professional help.

### Noritz Heater Not Providing Hot Water

A common problem is your Noritz tankless heater not providing hot water. This can happen for several reasons. Sometimes, you get no hot water at all. Other times, the water might be warm, but not hot enough. We need to check various components to find the cause.

First, check your power supply. Make sure the unit is plugged in. Look for a tripped circuit breaker. Resetting the breaker can often restore power. This is a simple fix that many people overlook.

Next, verify your gas supply. Ensure the gas valve to the water heater is fully open. If other gas appliances also do not work, you might have a gas outage. Check with your gas provider. Low gas pressure can also cause insufficient heating. Your utility company can confirm gas pressure.

Water flow is another critical factor. Tankless heaters need a minimum water flow to activate. If water pressure is too low, the unit will not turn on. Check if all your faucets have low water pressure. A clogged water filter can reduce flow. You can clean your [water heater filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-water-heater-filter) to fix this.

Air in the water lines can also cause issues. This happens after plumbing work. Run hot water at all faucets to purge the air. Sediment buildup inside the unit can restrict water flow too. Regular flushing helps prevent this. Learn how to [clean sediment from your water heater](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-sediment-from-water-heater).

Finally, check the temperature setting on your unit. Someone might have accidentally changed it. Adjust the temperature setting to your desired level. If these steps do not fix the problem, the issue might be with the flow sensor or igniter. These parts need a professional to inspect or replace.

### Low Water Flow or Pressure Issues

Low water flow or pressure affects how your Noritz tankless water heater works. The unit needs a certain flow rate to activate. If the flow is too low, the heater might not turn on. Or, it might turn on but deliver inconsistent hot water. Several issues can cause low flow.

One common cause is clogged water filters. Tankless water heaters have filters at the inlet. These filters catch sediment and debris from your water supply. Over time, these filters can get blocked. This blockage restricts water flow. You should regularly inspect and clean these filters. Cleaning the filter can significantly improve water flow.

Sediment buildup within the unit is another major culprit. Hard water leaves mineral deposits inside your heater's heat exchanger. This buildup acts like an insulating layer. It also narrows the pipes. This reduces heat transfer efficiency and water flow. You need to descale your tankless water heater regularly. This process flushes out the mineral deposits.

Aerators on faucets can also restrict water flow. If only one faucet has low hot water pressure, check its aerator. Unscrew the aerator and clean out any debris. This can often resolve localized flow issues. This is a simple solution often overlooked.

Sometimes, the water main valve is not fully open. Check the main water shut-off valve for your house. Make sure it is completely open. Partially closed valves restrict water to all your fixtures. Plumbing issues like pinches in water lines also cause flow problems. If you recently had plumbing work, check for kinked lines.

Lastly, check the flow sensor on your Noritz unit. This sensor detects water flow. If it is faulty, the unit might not activate even with good water pressure. A faulty flow sensor often requires professional replacement. These issues can be complex.

### Ignition and Gas Supply Problems

Ignition and gas supply problems are frequent reasons for a Noritz tankless heater not working. If your unit is not firing up, the issue often lies here. A proper gas supply and a working ignition system are essential for heating water. These components work together to create the flame.

First, check your gas supply. Ensure the gas valve to the water heater is open. This valve might be accidentally closed. Also, check other gas appliances in your home. If they are also not working, you might have a gas outage. Contact your gas utility company to confirm service. Low gas pressure can also prevent the unit from igniting properly.

The igniter is a key part of the ignition system. It creates a spark to light the gas. If the igniter is dirty or faulty, it cannot produce a spark. This leads to ignition failure (often indicated by an error code like 11). Cleaning the igniter might help. However, replacement by a professional is often necessary. A faulty igniter means no flame.

The flame sensor also plays a role. After the gas ignites, the flame sensor confirms the flame is present. If the sensor is dirty or failing, it might not detect the flame. The unit will then shut down for safety (sometimes showing an error code like 12). Cleaning the flame sensor can resolve this. You can learn how to [clean a water heater thermocouple](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-water-heater-thermocouple), which is similar in function for detecting flame.

Air in the gas lines can also prevent ignition. This often happens after gas line repairs. The unit might try to ignite several times without success. It then shuts down with an error code. Purging the gas lines of air can resolve this. This task typically needs a professional.

Make sure your gas regulator is functioning correctly. A bad regulator can cause inconsistent gas pressure. This leads to ignition issues or flame instability. These are complex parts. Always call a qualified technician for gas-related problems. Safety comes first with gas appliances.

### Venting and Combustion Air Issues

Proper venting and combustion air supply are crucial for the safe and efficient operation of your Noritz tankless water heater. These units need to draw in fresh air for combustion. They also need to expel exhaust gases safely. Blockages or improper ventilation can cause major problems. They often lead to unit shutdowns or error codes.

First, inspect the air intake and exhaust vents. Look for any physical obstructions. Birds nests, leaves, or debris can block these vents. Clear away any blockages you find. A blocked vent prevents the unit from breathing properly. This can cause the heater to overheat or fail to ignite.

Check the vent pipes for damage or disconnections. The pipes should be securely connected. There should be no cracks or leaks. Leaks in the exhaust vent can release dangerous carbon monoxide into your home. Ensure proper slope for condensation drainage. Water should not collect in the vent pipes.

The combustion blower helps move air through the system. If this fan is faulty, the unit cannot vent properly. Error codes like 71 (Combustion Blower Error) indicate a problem with the fan. Listen for unusual noises from the fan. A failing blower might make grinding sounds. This component usually needs professional repair.

Ensure there is enough fresh air in the room where the heater is installed. Tankless heaters need a good supply of oxygen for combustion. If the space is too small or sealed, the unit may not get enough air. This is called "air starvation." It can cause incomplete combustion and safety shutdowns. Adding proper ventilation to the room can help.

High altitudes can also affect combustion. If you live at a high elevation, your unit may need adjustment. Consult your owner's manual for high-altitude settings. Ignoring venting issues can be dangerous. Always ensure your Noritz heater has clear intake and exhaust paths. Call a professional if you suspect a serious vent problem.

### Regular Maintenance Prevents Noritz Problems

Regular maintenance is key to keeping your Noritz tankless water heater running smoothly. It helps prevent many common problems. Proper care extends the life of your unit. It also ensures efficient operation and avoids costly repairs. I always tell my friends that a little proactive care saves a lot of hassle later.

The most important maintenance task is descaling. Hard water contains minerals that build up inside your unit. These minerals form scale on the heat exchanger. This reduces efficiency and can cause overheating. Noritz recommends descaling your unit at least once a year. In areas with very hard water, you might need to do it more often. Descaling involves circulating a special solution through the heater. This solution dissolves the mineral buildup. You can find detailed guides on how to [clean a tankless water heater](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-tankless-water-heater). This process makes a big difference.

Another important step is cleaning the water inlet filter. Your Noritz unit has a small filter screen where water enters. This screen catches dirt and debris from your water supply. Over time, it can get clogged. A clogged filter restricts water flow, which can prevent the heater from activating. Turn off the water supply before removing and cleaning this filter. Rinse it thoroughly and put it back. This simple cleaning can solve many flow issues.

Check the gas supply lines and connections regularly. Look for any signs of leaks or damage. A soapy water solution can detect gas leaks. Bubbles will form if there is a leak. If you suspect a gas leak, evacuate and call your gas company immediately. Never try to fix gas leaks yourself.

Inspect the air intake and exhaust vents. Make sure they are clear of obstructions. Birds, insects, or debris can block these vents. A blocked vent can cause combustion issues. It can also lead to dangerous carbon monoxide buildup. Clean any visible blockages. Ensure the vent pipes are secure and undamaged.

Finally, keep an eye on your unit's performance. Notice any changes in hot water temperature or flow. Listen for unusual noises. Addressing small issues early prevents them from becoming big problems. Following these maintenance steps helps ensure your Noritz unit provides reliable hot water for years.

### When to Call a Professional for Noritz Repair

While some Noritz tankless water heater issues are DIY-friendly, many require a professional. Knowing when to call a technician saves you time and ensures safety. Trying to fix complex problems yourself can lead to further damage. It can also pose safety risks, especially with gas or electrical components.

You should call a professional if you encounter persistent error codes. Some codes indicate serious internal component failures. For example, issues with the heat exchanger, main circuit board, or gas valve are beyond typical home repairs. A technician has specialized tools and diagnostic equipment. They can accurately identify the root cause of these complex problems.

Gas leaks are an immediate reason to call a professional. If you smell gas, evacuate your home immediately. Then contact your gas company and a certified technician. Do not try to find or fix a gas leak yourself. Gas is highly flammable and dangerous. Your safety is the top priority.

Electrical problems also need expert attention. Issues with wiring, faulty connections, or internal electrical components can be hazardous. Working with electricity without proper knowledge can lead to shocks or fires. A qualified electrician or HVAC technician should handle these repairs. They understand safe electrical practices.

If you have performed basic troubleshooting steps and the problem remains, it is time for a pro. This includes checking power, gas, water supply, and cleaning filters. If your unit still gives no hot water or displays continuous error codes, call for service. Persistent low flow despite cleaning indicates a deeper problem.

Lastly, consider professional annual maintenance. Even if your unit is working, preventive checks by a technician are valuable. They can spot small issues before they become major breakdowns. They also perform deep cleaning and adjustments you cannot do yourself. A professional can ensure your Noritz unit operates at peak efficiency.
