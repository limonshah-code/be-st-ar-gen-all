### Clear Answer

Rexton hearing aid troubleshooting typically involves checking battery status, performing thorough cleaning to remove wax and debris, inspecting components like wax guards and domes for blockages, and resetting the device or its connection. These steps resolve most common sound, power, and connectivity issues.

### No Sound or Weak Sound from Your Rexton Hearing Aid

One of the most concerning problems for any hearing aid user is a lack of sound. If your Rexton hearing aid produces no sound at all, or the sound is very weak, it impacts your ability to hear. This issue often has a simple solution. Do not panic; we can address this together.

First, check the battery. For disposable battery models, ensure the battery is new and inserted correctly. The positive (+) side should face the correct direction. A low or dead battery is the most frequent cause of no sound. If you use rechargeable Rexton hearing aids, confirm the device is fully charged. Place it in its charger for the recommended time, then try again. Sometimes, the charging contacts may be dirty, preventing a full charge. Clean these contacts gently with a dry cloth.

Next, inspect for blockages. Earwax is a common culprit. Over time, wax can build up in the sound outlet or the wax guard. This blocks sound from reaching your ear. Use the small cleaning tools provided with your Rexton hearing aids. Carefully remove any visible wax from the dome or custom mold. For behind-the-ear (BTE) models, check the tubing for moisture or debris. If the tube looks blocked or cracked, it may need replacement. You can often purchase replacement tubes from your hearing care professional. Proper cleaning is important. Remember, [cleaning your hearing aids](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-widex-hearing-aids) regularly prevents many sound issues.

Lastly, check the volume settings. It might sound obvious, but sometimes the volume gets turned down accidentally. Use the physical buttons on your hearing aid or the Rexton app to increase the volume. If your hearing aid has a program button, ensure it is on the correct program for your environment. Sometimes, an incorrect program setting can make sounds seem too quiet. If these basic checks do not restore sound, you might need more specific troubleshooting steps.

### Addressing Feedback and Whistling Noises

Feedback, often heard as a whistling or buzzing sound, is a common Rexton hearing aid troubleshooting issue. This noise can be irritating for you and those around you. It happens when amplified sound escapes the ear canal and re-enters the hearing aid's microphone. Understanding the cause helps fix it.

A common reason for feedback is improper fit. If your Rexton hearing aid does not sit snugly in your ear, sound can leak out. This often happens if your ear canal changes shape slightly over time. Check the dome or ear mold. Ensure it is inserted deeply and correctly. If the dome is too small, or if the ear mold feels loose, you might need a different size. Your hearing care professional can help fit you with the correct size. A tight seal is crucial for preventing feedback.

Another significant cause of feedback is earwax buildup in your own ear. Excessive earwax can block the ear canal. This pushes the hearing aid out slightly or reflects sound back into the microphone. Regularly cleaning your ears helps. Do not insert cotton swabs deep into your ear canal. This can push wax further in. Consult a doctor or audiologist for professional earwax removal if you suspect a blockage. This is an important step for overall [hearing aid maintenance](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-resound-hearing-aids).

High volume settings also contribute to feedback. If your Rexton hearing aid's volume is too high for your listening environment, the amplified sound can easily leak. Try reducing the volume slightly. Sometimes, simply adjusting the volume can stop the whistling. Additionally, if you are holding something close to your ear, like a phone or a hat, it can create a feedback loop. Move the object away to see if the whistling stops. If feedback persists after these steps, the internal components might have a problem.

### Connectivity and App-Related Problems

Many modern Rexton hearing aids connect wirelessly to smartphones or other devices. This allows for easy control and streaming. However, connectivity issues can arise. These problems include devices not pairing, intermittent connections, or the Rexton app not responding. Troubleshooting these issues helps you regain full control of your hearing experience.

First, ensure Bluetooth is active on your smartphone or other connected device. Bluetooth needs to be on for pairing to occur. Turn Bluetooth off and then back on again. This can refresh the connection. Make sure your Rexton hearing aids are in pairing mode. For most Rexton models, you turn them off, wait a few seconds, then turn them back on. They usually enter pairing mode automatically for a short period. Consult your specific Rexton model manual for precise pairing instructions.

If your Rexton hearing aids were previously paired but now will not connect, try "forgetting" the device in your phone's Bluetooth settings. Then, restart both your phone and your hearing aids. After restarting, try the pairing process again from the beginning. This often resolves persistent connection glitches. Also, make sure your Rexton app is up to date. App updates fix bugs and improve performance. Check your phone's app store for any available updates for the Rexton app. An outdated app might not communicate properly with your hearing aids.

Interference can also cause connectivity problems. Other electronic devices can interfere with Bluetooth signals. Try moving away from other Wi-Fi routers, microwaves, or large electronic devices. Test the connection in a different location. If you continue to experience issues, a full factory reset of your hearing aids might be an option. Be aware that a factory reset will erase your personalized settings. Only use this as a last resort after trying all other troubleshooting steps. If you are having general [hearing aid connectivity issues](https://beacleaner.com/jabra-hearing-aids-troubleshooting), similar steps often apply.

### Battery Life and Charging Concerns

Battery issues are a common frustration for Rexton hearing aid users. Whether your batteries drain too quickly or your rechargeable device fails to hold a charge, these problems impact daily use. Addressing these concerns promptly helps maintain consistent hearing. I know this issue can be very annoying.

For Rexton hearing aids using disposable batteries, first, check the battery type and size. Using the wrong size or type can lead to poor performance and quick draining. Rexton hearing aids use specific zinc-air batteries. Ensure you are using fresh batteries. Batteries have an expiration date. Old batteries may not last as long. Store batteries in a cool, dry place; extreme temperatures can affect their life. Also, remember to peel off the battery tab completely. The battery activates once air reaches it. Sometimes, a partially removed tab can cause issues.

If you have rechargeable Rexton hearing aids, ensure the charging contacts on both the hearing aids and the charger are clean. Dirt or debris on these contacts can prevent proper charging. Use a dry, soft cloth to gently wipe them. Make sure the charger is plugged securely into a working power outlet. Check the charging indicator lights on your charger and hearing aids. They usually show if the device is charging. If no lights appear, the charger itself might have a problem. Try plugging another device into the outlet to confirm the outlet works.

Battery drain can also be affected by usage patterns. Frequent streaming of audio, using connectivity features often, or having the volume set very high can consume more power. Reduce streaming time or volume if you notice unusually fast battery drain. If you suspect your rechargeable battery is losing its capacity, it might be time for a replacement. Rechargeable hearing aid batteries degrade over time, just like phone batteries. Your hearing care professional can test the battery health and replace it if needed. Proper [hearing aid cleaning](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-oticon-hearing-aids) also contributes to overall device longevity, which indirectly impacts battery efficiency by preventing excessive strain from blockages.

### Essential Maintenance and Cleaning Practices

Proper maintenance and regular cleaning are critical for extending the life and performance of your Rexton hearing aids. Many common issues, including muffled sound or no sound, stem from a lack of consistent cleaning. I cannot stress enough how important this is. Daily care prevents problems.

Every day, gently wipe your Rexton hearing aids with a soft, dry cloth. This removes moisture, earwax, and debris from the surface. Pay special attention to the areas that come into contact with your skin or ear canal. For behind-the-ear (BTE) models, detach the ear mold or dome. Clean the ear mold with a special cleaning solution recommended by your audiologist or with mild soap and water. Ensure it is completely dry before reattaching it. Moisture can damage the electronic components of the hearing aid. Do not immerse the hearing aid body in water.

Next, focus on the wax guard or filter. This small component prevents earwax from entering the sound outlet. If this filter becomes clogged, sound cannot pass through. Your Rexton hearing aids likely came with a tool and replacement wax guards. Use the tool to remove the old, clogged guard and insert a new one. This is a simple but vital step that often resolves "no sound" issues. Replace wax guards regularly, usually every few weeks or when you notice a decrease in sound quality.

For tubing on BTE models, check for condensation or cracks. Moisture inside the tubing can muffle sound. You can gently blow air through the tube to clear condensation or use a special air blower. If the tube appears discolored, stiff, or cracked, it should be replaced. Regular professional cleaning by your audiologist is also beneficial. They have specialized tools to clean areas you cannot reach. Think of it as a tune-up for your hearing. Consistent care helps your Rexton devices work their best.

### Dealing with Physical Damage and Wear

Even with the best care, Rexton hearing aids can sometimes suffer from physical damage or natural wear and tear. Drops, impacts, or exposure to moisture can lead to problems. Recognizing signs of damage helps you decide the next steps. I know accidents happen.

Visible cracks on the casing, tubing, or ear mold are clear signs of physical damage. These cracks can affect sound quality or allow moisture to enter. If you notice a crack in the tubing, it might cause whistling or weak sound. A cracked ear mold might not fit properly, leading to feedback. Sometimes, the battery door can break. This prevents a secure battery connection, leading to intermittent power. Assess the extent of the damage. Minor issues like a cracked dome or tube can often be replaced at home or by your audiologist.

Moisture damage is another significant concern. Rexton hearing aids are delicate electronic devices. Water or excessive humidity can cause internal corrosion. Signs of moisture damage include intermittent sound, distortion, or the device simply not turning on. If your hearing aids get wet, immediately turn them off and remove the battery. Place them in a drying kit or a desiccant container. Do not use heat sources like a hairdryer. Heat can cause more damage. Let them dry for at least 24 hours. A dedicated drying kit is a worthwhile investment for hearing aid users.

Over time, components like domes and tubes naturally wear out. Domes can become stiff or lose their shape, impacting fit and sound. Tubing can harden, crack, or become discolored. These are normal wear issues. Replacing these parts regularly, as recommended by your hearing care professional, is part of routine maintenance. Keeping spare domes, wax guards, and tubes on hand is a good idea. If your hearing aid has been dropped or submerged, even if it seems to work, it is wise to have it checked by a professional. Internal damage might not be immediately obvious.

### When to Seek Professional Rexton Hearing Aid Support

While many Rexton hearing aid troubleshooting steps are simple and can be done at home, some problems require professional expertise. Knowing when to contact your audiologist or hearing care provider saves you time and prevents further damage. I want you to get the best help.

If you have tried all the basic troubleshooting steps—checking batteries, cleaning, inspecting for blockages, and resetting the device—and the problem persists, it is time for professional help. For example, if your hearing aid still has no sound after a new battery and a clean wax guard, the issue is likely internal. Persistent feedback that cannot be resolved by proper fit or volume adjustments also warrants a visit. These issues often point to internal component failure.

Physical damage that you cannot easily replace, such as a broken casing, a damaged microphone, or a problem with the receiver, needs professional repair. Attempting to fix complex internal issues yourself can void your warranty. It can also cause irreparable damage. Audiologists have specialized tools and diagnostic equipment to identify and fix these problems. They can also replace internal parts.

Lastly, if your Rexton hearing aid is still under warranty, contact your provider before attempting any significant repairs. DIY repairs can void the warranty. Your audiologist can assess the device. They can determine if it needs factory repair or replacement. They can also help with programming issues. Sometimes, your hearing aid settings might need fine-tuning. This ensures they match your hearing needs. A professional check-up ensures your Rexton hearing aids provide optimal sound and last longer.
