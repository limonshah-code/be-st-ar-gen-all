## How To Take Apart Your Bissell Carpet Cleaner For Deep Cleaning

Have you ever finished cleaning your carpets, only to notice that your Bissell carpet cleaner smells a little off? Or maybe it just does not seem to clean as well as it used to? A dirty carpet cleaner can spread grime more than it removes it. This guide helps you understand exactly how to take apart Bissell carpet cleaner to clean it properly. You will learn the simple steps to deep clean your machine, ensuring it works its best every time. Let's make sure your carpet cleaner keeps delivering fresh, clean results.

### Takeaway

*   Always unplug and empty your Bissell cleaner before starting any disassembly.
*   Start by cleaning the tanks and easily detachable parts like hoses.
*   Focus on the brush roll and nozzle assembly, as these are common clog points.
*   Inspect and clean filters, and check for hidden debris in internal components.
*   Reassemble carefully, ensuring all parts click into place and seals are secure.
*   Regular cleaning prevents buildup and extends your machine's life.

To take apart a Bissell carpet cleaner for cleaning, you generally remove the dirty and clean water tanks, detach the brush roll cover and brush, and often the nozzle assembly. You then rinse each component thoroughly, clear any hair or debris, and allow parts to air dry completely before reassembly to prevent mold and ensure proper function.

### Why Deep Clean Your Bissell Carpet Cleaner?

Your Bissell carpet cleaner removes dirt and stains from your floors. However, this dirt does not just disappear. It collects inside the machine itself. Over time, hair, grime, and cleaning solution residue build up. This can cause several problems.

A dirty machine cannot clean effectively. It might leave streaks or even deposit old dirt back onto your carpets. You might also notice unpleasant odors coming from the cleaner. This smell comes from mold and mildew growing in damp, dirty areas inside the machine. Regular deep cleaning stops these issues. It keeps your cleaner working its best. It also helps your machine last longer, protecting your investment.

Neglecting to clean your Bissell machine means you are likely pushing dirty water through clogged pathways. This reduces suction power. Your carpets will not dry quickly, which can lead to new problems like mold growth in your home. Taking the time to disassemble and clean your carpet cleaner is a smart step for healthier carpets and a healthier home environment. Think of it as essential maintenance. This ensures every cleaning session actually cleans, rather than just moving dirt around.

### Safety First: Essential Preparations Before Disassembly

Before you start taking apart your Bissell carpet cleaner, safety must come first. Working with any electrical appliance requires careful attention. This initial preparation step is simple but very important. It prevents accidents and makes the cleaning process easier for you.

First, always unplug your machine from the electrical outlet. This removes any risk of electric shock while you are handling the internal parts. Next, empty both the clean water tank and the dirty water recovery tank completely. Rinse these tanks with clean water to remove any leftover solution or dirty water. This prevents spills and makes the tanks easier to handle.

Gather your tools before you begin. You will need a screwdriver, usually a Phillips head, for some models. You might also want a pair of old scissors or a seam ripper to cut away tangled hair from the brush roll. A small brush or old toothbrush is useful for scrubbing tight spots. Have a designated area ready for the dirty parts. This preparation helps the disassembly go smoothly and keeps you safe.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Disassembling the Bissell Tanks and Hoses

Beginning the disassembly process is straightforward once you have prepared your work area. The first parts to remove are usually the easiest. This typically involves the water tanks and any detachable hoses. Each Bissell model can differ slightly, so always check your specific model's manual if you are unsure. However, the general steps for tanks and hoses are quite consistent across most carpet shampooers.

Start by locating the clean water tank. This tank holds the water and cleaning solution. It often lifts straight up or unlatches with a simple button press. Once removed, empty any remaining solution and rinse it thoroughly with warm water. You can even use a small amount of mild dish soap to cut through residue. Rinse until the water runs clear. Next, remove the dirty water recovery tank. This tank collects the dirty water vacuumed from your carpets. This tank often contains a lot of grime and hair. Empty it carefully into a utility sink or toilet. Rinse this tank multiple times until all visible dirt is gone. Pay special attention to the filter screen often located within this tank.

Many Bissell models have a detachable hose for spot cleaning. If your model has one, locate its connection point. This hose often unlatches or twists off easily. Once detached, run clean water through the hose to flush out any debris or dirty solution. You can also carefully stretch the hose to dislodge anything stuck inside. Allow both tanks and the hose to air dry completely before putting them back. This step prevents mildew growth.

### Cleaning the Brush Roll and Nozzle Assembly

The brush roll and nozzle assembly are critical parts of your Bissell carpet cleaner. They do the hard work of scrubbing and extracting. Because of this, they accumulate the most dirt, hair, and debris. This section often requires the most effort to clean. Taking apart these components is essential for effective cleaning and maintaining strong suction.

Most Bissell models have a removable brush roll cover. This cover usually unlatches or is held in place by a few screws. Use your Phillips head screwdriver to remove these screws carefully. Once the cover is off, you can access the brush roll. The brush roll itself often lifts out easily, sometimes with a little twist. You will likely find a significant amount of hair, carpet fibers, and other debris wrapped around it. Use scissors or a seam ripper to cut away all the tangled material. Be careful not to cut the brush bristles themselves.

After clearing the debris, thoroughly rinse the brush roll under warm running water. You can use a small brush to scrub the bristles and dislodge any caked-on dirt. Ensure the bristles are free from all foreign material. The nozzle assembly is the clear plastic part that sits over the brush roll. This part directs the water spray and helps with suction. It can become clogged with lint and dirt. Rinse it well, making sure all openings are clear. You may need to use a thin tool or a toothpick to clear small nozzles. Let the brush roll and nozzle air dry completely before reassembly. This deep cleaning process greatly improves your carpet cleaner's performance. For specific models, like the Bissell CrossWave, disassembly might vary slightly, but the principles of cleaning are similar: [how to clean bissell crosswave](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-crosswave).

### Addressing Filters, Belts, and Internal Components

Beyond the visible tanks and brush roll, your Bissell carpet cleaner has other components that need attention. These parts, including filters and belts, play a vital role in the machine's overall function and longevity. Neglecting them can lead to poor performance or even damage. This step involves a bit more inspection and care.

First, locate any filters your machine might have. Many Bissell models have a filter in the dirty water tank or near the motor housing. These filters trap fine particles and protect the motor. Remove the filter and rinse it under running water until it is clean. Some filters are washable foam, others are mesh. Ensure it is completely dry before reinstalling it. A clogged filter severely reduces suction power.

Next, inspect the belt that drives the brush roll. This belt is usually located underneath the brush roll assembly. Look for any signs of wear, fraying, or stretching. If the belt looks damaged, it might need replacement. While cleaning, ensure no hair or debris is wrapped around the belt or its pulleys. This can cause the brush roll to stop spinning or work inefficiently. You do not always need to take apart more internal components unless there is a specific issue like a major clog that is not resolved by cleaning the brush and tanks. If you suspect a deeper clog or issue within the internal suction path, some models allow access to the vacuum path or motor housing by removing additional screws on the main body. However, for most routine deep cleaning, focusing on tanks, brushes, and filters is sufficient. Remember, always consult your specific model's manual for detailed instructions on accessing more internal parts.

### Reassembling Your Bissell Carpet Cleaner Properly

Once all the components of your Bissell carpet cleaner are sparkling clean and thoroughly dry, it is time for reassembly. Putting your machine back together correctly is just as important as taking it apart. Improper reassembly can lead to leaks, poor performance, or even damage to the unit. Take your time with this step to ensure everything fits perfectly.

Start by reattaching the brush roll. Carefully slide it back into its designated slot. Make sure it spins freely. Then, place the brush roll cover back over the brush. Align any tabs or clips. Gently tighten the screws you removed earlier. Do not overtighten, as this can strip the plastic. Ensure the nozzle assembly is also clean and properly seated. You should hear a click or feel it securely latch into place.

Next, reinstall any filters you removed. Make sure they are dry and correctly positioned. Then, replace the dirty water recovery tank, ensuring it locks firmly into position. Finally, fill your clean water tank with fresh water and cleaning solution, then place it back on the machine. Double-check that all latches are secure and there are no gaps where water could leak. Once everything is back in place, plug in your Bissell cleaner and run a quick test. Listen for any unusual noises and check for proper suction. A properly reassembled machine will work like new. This careful reassembly ensures that your hard work cleaning pays off, giving you top performance from your carpet cleaner.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues After Cleaning

Even after a thorough cleaning and careful reassembly, you might encounter a few issues. Do not worry; many common problems have simple solutions. Understanding what to look for can save you time and frustration. My goal is to help you get your Bissell carpet cleaner working perfectly again.

One common issue is poor suction. If your machine is not picking up water effectively, first check the dirty water tank. Ensure it is properly sealed and that the float, if your model has one, is not stuck. Next, inspect the nozzle assembly again. A small piece of debris can easily block the suction path. Also, confirm the brush roll is spinning correctly. If the belt is loose or damaged, the brush roll might not engage. For some models, like the Bissell ProHeat Pet Turbo, specific brush roll issues might arise, which are often detailed in their manuals: [how to clean bissell proheat pet turbo](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-proheat-pet-turbo).

Another issue might be leaks. If water is leaking, the most likely culprit is an improperly seated tank or a damaged seal. Remove both tanks and reposition them. Check the rubber seals around the tank openings and hose connections for cracks or wear. A small tear can cause significant leakage. If the leak persists, you might need to replace a seal. Strange noises, like a grinding sound, often indicate something is caught in the brush roll or a bearing needs attention. Stop the machine immediately and re-inspect the brush roll area. These steps usually resolve most post-cleaning problems, helping your Bissell perform as expected.

### Regular Maintenance Tips for Your Bissell Cleaner

Keeping your Bissell carpet cleaner in top condition goes beyond a yearly deep clean. Regular, simple maintenance after each use or every few uses can prevent major buildup and extend the life of your machine significantly. These habits are quick to adopt and make a big difference.

After every cleaning session, empty both the clean and dirty water tanks immediately. Rinse them thoroughly with warm water. This prevents residue from drying and hardening, which is much harder to clean later. Also, rinse the nozzle and brush roll cover. If your brush roll gathers a lot of hair, take a moment to cut and pull it free after each use. This prevents tangles from becoming severe.

Store your Bissell cleaner in a dry, clean place. Avoid storing it in damp basements where mildew can thrive. Ensure all parts are completely dry before putting the machine away. If you use cleaning solutions, always use formulas specifically designed for Bissell machines. Using off-brand or homemade solutions can sometimes damage internal components or leave excessive residue. Following these simple routines keeps your Bissell ready for its next job, ensuring effective cleaning every time. Regular attention to your machine, similar to consistent cleaning of a specific model like the Bissell Revolution Pet Pro, ensures long-term performance: [how to clean bissell revolution pet pro](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-revolution-pet-pro).

### FAQ Section

#### How often should I deep clean my Bissell carpet cleaner?
You should deep clean your Bissell carpet cleaner every 3-5 uses, or at least every 6 months, depending on how frequently you use it and how dirty your carpets are. If you notice reduced suction, strange odors, or streaking, it is time for a thorough cleaning regardless of your schedule. Regular maintenance after each use helps prolong the time between deep cleans.

#### Can I use dish soap to clean my Bissell carpet cleaner's parts?
Yes, you can use a small amount of mild dish soap mixed with warm water to clean the tanks, brush roll, and nozzle parts of your Bissell carpet cleaner.
