### Step 3: Gentle Scraping with a Non-Conductive Tool

If compressed air does not clear all the debris, use a non-conductive tool. A wooden or plastic toothpick works best. Gently insert the tip into the port. Carefully scrape along the inner walls and around the plastic divider. The goal is to hook and pull out any packed-in lint or dirt. Be extremely gentle. Do not apply force that could bend the internal pins. Focus on the corners and the bottom of the port where lint often collects. Repeat this step until you see no more visible debris.

### Step 4: Finishing Touches with Isopropyl Alcohol (Optional)

For persistent grime or minor corrosion, a small amount of 99% isopropyl alcohol helps. Dip a fine-tipped cotton swab (like a specialized electronics swab or a trimmed Q-tip) into the alcohol. Make sure the swab is damp, not dripping wet. Gently wipe the internal contacts of the port. The alcohol quickly evaporates, leaving no residue. This step helps remove oily films or oxidized layers. Allow the port to air dry completely for at least 15-30 minutes before reinserting any cables. This ensures all alcohol has evaporated.

### Step 5: Re-inspect and Test

After cleaning, use your light source to re-inspect the port. Confirm all debris is gone. The metallic contacts should look clean and shiny. Then, plug in your USB device. Test the connection. Your device should now connect securely and function correctly. If the issue persists, the problem may be beyond a simple cleaning.
