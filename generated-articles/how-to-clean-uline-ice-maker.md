First, turn off your Uline ice maker. Unplug the machine from the power outlet. This is a critical safety step. Never work on an appliance while it is plugged in. Next, empty the ice bin completely. Discard any remaining ice.

Locate the drain plug or valve. Most Uline models have one. Drain all water from the reservoir and lines. Some models have a self-cleaning cycle. Even with this feature, manual draining is necessary. Remove any removable parts like the ice bin, scoop, or water filter. These parts need separate cleaning.

### Cleaning the Water System (Descaling)

Now, it is time to descale the machine. This removes mineral buildup. Mix your descaling solution according to product instructions. For citric acid, follow the package directions. If using vinegar, combine equal parts white vinegar and water. Pour the solution into the ice maker's water reservoir.

Start a cleaning cycle if your Uline model has one. If not, let the solution sit for 20-30 minutes. This allows it to break down the scale. After the cycle or soak time, drain the solution completely. Repeat this process with clean water. This rinses out the descaling agent.

### Sanitizing the Ice Bin and Components

While the descaling solution works, clean the removable parts. Wash the ice bin, scoop, and any other removable components. Use warm, soapy water for this step. For deeper cleaning, prepare a sanitizing solution. You can use a commercial ice maker sanitizer or a diluted bleach solution (one tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water).

Soak the parts in the sanitizing solution for a few minutes. Then, scrub them gently with a soft brush or cloth. Pay attention to corners and crevices. Rinse all parts thoroughly with clean water. Ensure no soap or sanitizer residue remains.
