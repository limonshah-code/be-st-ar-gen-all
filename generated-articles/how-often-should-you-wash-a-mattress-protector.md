## Why Washing Your Mattress Protector Matters for a Clean Bed

Your mattress protector is more than just a sheet. It forms a shield for your mattress. This shield protects against many things. It keeps out sweat, skin cells, and spills. These things can damage your mattress over time.

Think about what happens while you sleep. Your body releases sweat and dead skin cells. These can soak into your mattress. A protector stops this. Without it, your mattress would become a home for dust mites. It could also develop odors or stains.
