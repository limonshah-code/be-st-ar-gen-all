Next, get your can of compressed air. Hold the can upright. Use short bursts of air. Never spray continuously. Continuous spraying can release cold propellant. This can damage internal components. Aim the straw attachment at a 75-degree angle to the keyboard surface. Do not spray directly down onto the keys. Tilt your MacBook Pro. This allows gravity to help remove dislodged debris. Spray in a sweeping motion. Work across the entire keyboard. Focus on the spaces between keys. You will see dust and crumbs fly out. Repeat this process a few times. Change the angle of your MacBook Pro. This ensures all loose particles are removed.

After compressed air, use a clean microfiber cloth. Dampen it slightly with 99% isopropyl alcohol. Wring out any excess liquid. The cloth should be damp, not wet. Gently wipe the surface of each key. Wipe the areas between the keys. This removes sticky residue and oils. Isopropyl alcohol evaporates quickly. This makes it safe for electronics. Do not spray alcohol directly onto the keyboard. Always apply it to the cloth first. For stubborn spots, use a cotton swab. Dip the swab in isopropyl alcohol. Gently rub the dirty area. This basic cleaning routine keeps your MacBook Pro keyboard looking fresh. It also helps maintain its responsiveness. For more information on cleaning without removing keys, consider reading guides on [how to clean keyboard without removing keys](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-keyboard-without-removing-keys). Regular basic cleaning prevents major issues. It extends the life of your keyboard. This simple maintenance makes a big difference.

## Deep Cleaning: Addressing Stuck Keys and Debris Underneath

Sometimes, basic cleaning is not enough. Keys might still stick or feel unresponsive. This often means debris is trapped under the keycap. Deep cleaning helps resolve these issues. This process is more involved. It requires extra caution.

Before starting, identify your MacBook Pro keyboard type. Older models (pre-2016) often have scissor-switch mechanisms. Their keycaps are easier to remove. Newer models (2016-2019) have butterfly mechanisms. These are very fragile. Their keycaps are difficult to remove safely. The latest models (2020 and newer) use an improved scissor mechanism. Even with these, prying up keycaps can cause damage. We recommend caution. If you are unsure, consult Apple's support. Or seek professional help.

For scissor-switch keyboards where keycap removal is possible:
1.  **Power Down:** Turn off your MacBook Pro. Unplug it.
2.  **Use a Keycap Puller:** Gently hook the keycap puller under the edges of the stubborn key. Apply even, gentle pressure. Lift straight up. Do not force it. The keycap should pop off.
3.  **Clean Underneath:** Once the keycap is off, you will see the switch mechanism. Use compressed air to blow out any dust or debris. Hold the can upright. Aim short bursts. You can also use a cotton swab. Lightly dampen it with 99% isopropyl alcohol. Carefully clean around the switch mechanism. Remove any grime.
4.  **Clean the Keycap:** Wipe the underside of the removed keycap. Use a slightly damp microfiber cloth with isopropyl alcohol.
5.  **Reattach Keycap:** Align the keycap with its switch. Press down firmly until it clicks into place. Ensure it sits flat and operates correctly.

For butterfly or newer scissor-switch keyboards:
Do not try to remove keycaps. Prying them can break the delicate hinges. Instead, try the following steps for stuck keys:
1.  **Compressed Air at Angle:** Turn your MacBook Pro to a 75-degree angle. Use compressed air. Spray repeatedly from left to right. Then rotate the laptop. Spray from right to left. Repeat this several times. This method helps dislodge particles stuck under the butterfly mechanism.
2.  **Gentle Tapping:** After spraying, gently tap the problematic key. See if it becomes unstuck.
3.  **Isopropyl Alcohol Spot Treatment:** Dampen a small section of a microfiber cloth or a cotton swab with 99% isopropyl alcohol. Squeeze out excess liquid. Gently wipe the edges of the stuck key. The alcohol may seep under the key. It can help dissolve sticky residue. Allow it to air dry completely. This method is often useful for how to clean Mac keyboard under keys without full disassembly.

If a key remains stuck after these attempts, professional service might be necessary. Avoid using sharp objects to poke under keys. This can cause irreversible damage. Be gentle and patient. Refer to specialized guides for cleaning under keys, like [how to clean mac keyboard under keys](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mac-keyboard-under-keys). Always proceed with caution during deep cleaning.
