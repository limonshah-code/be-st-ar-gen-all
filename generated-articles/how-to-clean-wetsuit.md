## Keep Your Wetsuit Fresh: How To Clean Wetsuit Effectively

My wetsuit is one of my most essential pieces of gear for water sports. It protects me from cold and offers buoyancy. However, after every use, especially in salt water or chlorinated pools, it picks up grime, sand, salt, and sometimes unpleasant smells. Neglecting proper cleaning can lead to material degradation and lingering odors, shortening its life. I know this from experience.

Learning how to clean wetsuit properly is not just about hygiene; it is also about extending your investment. A clean wetsuit performs better and lasts longer. This article shares the best practices for cleaning, drying, and storing your wetsuit. I will guide you through simple steps to keep your wetsuit in top condition. We cover everything from quick rinses to deep cleaning and odor removal.

### Takeaway:

*   **Rinse Immediately:** Always rinse your wetsuit with fresh, cool water right after each use to remove salt, chlorine, and sand.
*   **Hand Wash Gently:** Use a mild, wetsuit-specific cleaner or gentle soap for deep cleaning. Avoid harsh chemicals.
*   **Air Dry Completely:** Dry your wetsuit inside out first, then flip it. Hang it on a wide hanger in a shaded, well-ventilated area.
*   **Store Properly:** Store your wetsuit flat or on a wide hanger, away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures, to prevent creasing and damage.

### How To Clean Wetsuit: The Quick Answer

To clean a wetsuit, rinse it thoroughly with fresh, cool water immediately after use. For a deeper clean, hand wash it gently in a tub with a wetsuit-specific shampoo or mild soap. Rinse completely, then hang it inside out on a wide hanger in the shade to air dry fully.

## Why Cleaning Your Wetsuit Matters So Much

I often see people finish their session and just toss their wetsuit in a bag. This habit hurts the wetsuit over time. Saltwater, chlorine, body oils, and even sweat build up on the neoprene fabric. These elements do not just make your wetsuit smell bad; they also break down the material.

Neoprene, the main material of most wetsuits, is durable but sensitive to harsh conditions. Salt crystals can abrade the fabric, creating tiny cuts. Chlorine can dry out and crack the material, reducing its flexibility. Body oils and sweat can lead to bacterial growth, which causes persistent odors. Think about how you clean other items that get wet, like [how to clean water shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-water-shoes); similar principles apply to wetsuits.

Proper cleaning prevents these issues. It stops material degradation, ensuring your wetsuit stays flexible and insulating. It also eliminates bacteria and mold, keeping your wetsuit fresh and hygienic. This means your wetsuit performs better and lasts for many more seasons. I have seen firsthand how a well-maintained wetsuit outlasts a neglected one.

## Immediate Rinse: Your First Line of Defense for Wetsuit Care

The most important step in wetsuit care happens right after you finish your activity. You must rinse your wetsuit with fresh, cool water as soon as possible. Do not let salt water or chlorinated water dry on the neoprene. These substances are corrosive and will accelerate the degradation of your wetsuit's material.

I always carry a large jug of fresh water in my car for this exact purpose. As soon as I get out of the water, I give my wetsuit a good rinse. This simple action removes most of the salt, sand, and chlorine before they can set in. Think of it as a preliminary wash that prevents bigger problems.

To rinse, turn your wetsuit inside out first. This allows you to flush out any sand or debris trapped inside. Use a hose or a bucket of water to thoroughly wash both the inside and outside. Pay attention to seams and zippers, as sand loves to hide in these areas. This quick rinse helps keep your wetsuit free from immediate damage and odors.

## Deep Cleaning Your Wetsuit: Hand Washing Essentials

While a quick rinse is good, your wetsuit needs a deeper clean periodically. This is especially true after several uses or if it starts to develop an odor. Hand washing is the best method for wetsuits. Machine washing can damage the delicate neoprene and seams.

You will need a large tub or a clean bathtub. Fill it with cool or lukewarm water. Hot water can damage the neoprene and glues used in your wetsuit. Add a small amount of wetsuit-specific cleaner. These cleaners are formulated to be gentle on neoprene while effectively removing salt, chlorine, and organic matter. If you do not have a wetsuit cleaner, a very mild, non-detergent soap can work. Avoid harsh detergents, bleach, or fabric softeners. These products can strip the neoprene's natural oils and break down the material.

Submerge your wetsuit completely in the water. Gently agitate the water and lightly scrub the wetsuit with your hands. Focus on areas that get a lot of contact with your body, like the armpits and crotch. Let it soak for about 15-20 minutes. After soaking, drain the soapy water. Rinse the wetsuit thoroughly with fresh, cool water until all soap residue is gone. Make sure no suds remain, as soap can attract dirt and degrade the material over time.

## Tackling Stubborn Odors and Mold on Your Wetsuit

Sometimes, despite regular rinsing, your wetsuit can develop stubborn odors or even mold. This usually happens when it does not dry properly or if bacteria have had a chance to grow. Dealing with these issues promptly is important to save your wetsuit.

For odors, a simple solution of white vinegar and water often works wonders. White vinegar is a natural deodorizer and has mild antiseptic properties. Mix one part white vinegar with four parts cool water in your tub. Submerge your wetsuit in this solution and let it soak for about 30 minutes. The vinegar helps neutralize the bacteria causing the smell. After soaking, rinse the wetsuit thoroughly with fresh water. The vinegar smell will dissipate as the wetsuit dries. This method is similar to how you might use vinegar to clean [how to clean shower with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shower-with-vinegar).

If you find mold or mildew spots, act quickly. Mold can severely damage neoprene and is a health hazard. Create a gentle cleaning solution with a wetsuit cleaner or mild soap and cool water. Use a soft brush or cloth to gently scrub the affected areas. Do not use harsh brushes or abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch or tear the neoprene. For more persistent mold, a very diluted solution of specialized wetsuit cleaner with anti-bacterial properties might be needed. Always test on a small, inconspicuous area first. For comparison, managing mold in other humid environments, like learning [how to clean mold in shower](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-in-shower), involves similar principles of gentle cleaning and preventing regrowth. After treating mold, ensure the wetsuit dries completely and quickly. Proper drying is key to preventing future mold growth.

## Proper Wetsuit Drying Techniques for Longevity

Drying your wetsuit correctly is as crucial as cleaning it. Incorrect drying methods can lead to mold growth, material degradation, and unpleasant odors. I have seen many wetsuits ruined by being left in the sun or crumpled in a corner.

First, avoid direct sunlight. UV rays are extremely harmful to neoprene. They break down the material, making it brittle and shortening its lifespan significantly. Always dry your wetsuit in a shaded, well-ventilated area. A garage, a shady spot outdoors, or even a spacious bathroom can work.

Second, use a proper hanger. Do not hang your wetsuit on a thin wire hanger. The weight of a wet wetsuit can stretch and damage the shoulders, creating permanent creases or weak spots. Instead, use a wide plastic or wooden hanger designed for wetsuits or a sturdy clothing hanger with broad shoulders. You can also fold your wetsuit in half over the crossbar of a wide hanger to distribute the weight evenly, which is what I usually do.

Hang your wetsuit inside out first. This allows the internal lining, which gets most contact with your body, to dry completely. Once the inside is dry (which might take a few hours or overnight), flip it right side out to dry the exterior. Ensure the wetsuit is completely dry before storing it. Any moisture left behind can lead to mildew and foul smells.

## Storing Your Wetsuit for Maximum Life

Proper storage is the final piece of the wetsuit care puzzle. Even if you clean and dry it perfectly, poor storage can undo all your hard work. Correct storage prevents damage, keeps the neoprene supple, and ensures your wetsuit is ready for your next adventure.

The goal of storage is to avoid creases, extreme temperatures, and direct light. Creases can create permanent weak spots in the neoprene, leading to cracks and tears. Avoid folding your wetsuit tightly or stuffing it into a bag for long-term storage.

My preferred method for long-term storage is to hang the wetsuit on a wide, padded hanger. As mentioned, drape it over the hanger's crossbar to distribute the weight evenly. If hanging is not an option, store your wetsuit flat. You can lay it under your bed or on a large shelf. Make sure there are no heavy objects on top of it that could create pressure points.

Store your wetsuit in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme heat or cold. Basements and attics can be too humid or have extreme temperature fluctuations, which are not ideal. A closet or a dedicated gear locker is usually best. This proper storage routine helps maintain the neoprene's integrity and extends the overall life of your wetsuit.

## Common Wetsuit Cleaning Mistakes to Avoid

Many common mistakes can shorten your wetsuit's life or even ruin it. Knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do. I have learned these lessons the hard way, so you do not have to.

**First, never use a washing machine or dryer.** A washing machine's agitation and spin cycles are too harsh for neoprene. They can stretch, tear, and damage the seams. A dryer's high heat will melt or severely damage the neoprene, making it stiff and unusable. Always hand wash and air dry.

**Second, avoid harsh chemicals.** Bleach, strong detergents, fabric softeners, and chemical solvents are detrimental to neoprene. They strip the material's protective coatings, break down its structure, and can cause discoloration. Stick to wetsuit-specific cleaners or very mild, pH-neutral soaps.

**Third, do not dry in direct sunlight.** As I mentioned, UV rays are neoprene's worst enemy. They cause rapid degradation, leading to brittleness and cracking. Always dry your wetsuit in the shade.

**Fourth, avoid improper hanging.** Thin wire hangers create sharp pressure points that will permanently crease and damage the shoulder area. Never store your wetsuit crumpled in a ball or folded tightly for long periods. These habits cause irreversible damage to the neoprene, reducing your wetsuit's flexibility and warmth. By avoiding these common errors, you protect your investment and ensure your wetsuit stays in excellent condition for many years of enjoyment.

## When to Consider Professional Wetsuit Cleaning or Repair

While DIY cleaning covers most wetsuit maintenance needs, there are times when professional help might be the best option. I consider professional services when my own efforts are not enough or if the damage seems beyond my skill.

One key situation is when your wetsuit has a persistent, deep-seated odor that regular cleaning cannot remove. This might indicate extensive bacterial growth within the neoprene that requires specialized treatment. Professionals have access to industrial-grade cleaning agents and methods that are safe for neoprene but more powerful than home solutions.

Another reason is significant damage. If your wetsuit has a large tear, a broken zipper, or seams coming apart, a professional repair service is often necessary. They have the right glues, patches, and stitching equipment to restore your wetsuit without compromising its performance. Trying to fix complex issues at home can sometimes make the problem worse, especially with materials like neoprene.

Finally, if you use your wetsuit very frequently in harsh conditions, like commercial diving or extreme sports, regular professional cleaning could be a good investment. They can perform a thorough deep clean and inspection, identifying potential wear and tear before it becomes a major issue. Think of it as preventative maintenance for your most important gear.
