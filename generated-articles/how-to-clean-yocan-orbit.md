## Disassembling Your Yocan Orbit Safely

Disassembling your Yocan Orbit is the first step in cleaning. Handle each part gently. This prevents damage to the device. The Yocan Orbit has a simple design, making disassembly straightforward. Take your time with each component.

Follow these steps to take apart your Yocan Orbit:
1.  **Remove the Glass Attachment:** Gently twist and pull the glass top piece from the battery base. This piece typically connects via a silicone seal or magnetic connection. Set it aside carefully on a soft surface to prevent breakage.
2.  **Separate the Atomizer:** Unscrew the atomizer from the battery base. The atomizer is the main heating component. It usually twists off in a counter-clockwise direction. This part often has the most reclaim buildup.
3.  **Detach the Coil (if applicable):** Inside the atomizer, you will find the coil. The Yocan Orbit uses a TGT coil, which is a unique spinning coil design. This coil may be removable or integrated. If it's designed to be removed, gently unscrew or pull it out. Be careful not to bend or damage the delicate heating element wires.
4.  **Remove the Silicone Ring (if any):** Some parts may have small silicone rings or O-rings. These create seals and prevent leaks. Carefully slide them off to clean them separately. They often get sticky with residue.
5.  **Examine the Battery Base:** The main battery base should not be submerged in liquid. Inspect it for any visible residue around the 510 connection or air holes. You will clean this part differently later.

Place all removed components on a clean paper towel. This keeps them organized and prevents loss. Do not force any parts during disassembly. If something feels stuck, check your device manual for specific instructions. Safe disassembly makes cleaning much easier.

## Deep Cleaning Yocan Orbit Glass Components

The glass attachment on your Yocan Orbit is crucial for clean vapor. It collects a lot of reclaim and residue. Cleaning this part properly ensures clear visibility and pure hits. Isopropyl alcohol is the best solution for this task.

Start by placing your separated glass attachment into a small container. Pour enough 90% or higher isopropyl alcohol into the container to fully submerge the glass. Let the glass soak for at least 30 minutes. For heavily soiled glass, you might let it soak for a few hours or even overnight. This soaking dissolves stubborn, sticky concentrate residue effectively.

After soaking, remove the glass from the alcohol. Use a cotton swab or a pipe cleaner to scrub any remaining residue. Pay attention to the inside curves and any small holes. You want the glass to be perfectly clear. If some residue still clings, you can try a second soak. You can also try a solution of warm water and vinegar for very tough spots if isopropyl alcohol alone is not enough. Learn more about cleaning glass with vinegar to tackle stubborn stains. [how to clean glass with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-glass-with-vinegar) After scrubbing, rinse the glass thoroughly under warm running water. Ensure all alcohol and loosened residue are gone. Let the glass air dry completely on a paper towel before reassembling. Any moisture left could affect device performance or safety.

## Cleaning the Yocan Orbit Atomizer and Coils

The atomizer and coils are the heart of your Yocan Orbit. They handle the heating of your concentrates. This means they accumulate the most residue. Thorough cleaning here ensures optimal vapor production and flavor. The Yocan Orbit features a TGT coil, which stands for "Target Tech Glass" coil, making careful cleaning important.

Start by carefully removing the atomizer from the battery. If your TGT coil is designed to be fully removed from the atomizer housing, take it out. Place the atomizer housing and any removable coil parts into a small glass container. Pour 90% or higher isopropyl alcohol over them until they are completely submerged. Allow these parts to soak for at least one hour. For heavy buildup, a longer soak of several hours or even overnight is beneficial. The alcohol dissolves the sticky reclaim.

After soaking, remove the components from the alcohol. Use cotton swabs and pipe cleaners to scrub away any remaining residue. Pay close attention to the coil's quartz balls and glass tube, which can trap concentrate. For very stubborn, hardened reclaim, a stiff pipe cleaner can help dislodge it. You can also try a short, gentle scrub with a brush. Make sure no parts of the coil are bent or damaged. For detailed advice on cleaning these critical components, you can refer to our guide on [how to clean Yocan coils](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-yocan-coils). Rinse all parts thoroughly under warm running water. Ensure all alcohol and loosened debris are removed. Let the atomizer and coils air dry completely. They must be bone dry before you put them back into the device. Any moisture can cause issues when you try to use the device again.

Sometimes, reclaim can be incredibly sticky and difficult to remove, almost resembling a stubborn, mold-like residue. In such cases, a more aggressive cleaning agent, like vinegar, can be a helpful addition to your cleaning routine. Vinegar's acidic properties help break down tough, caked-on buildup. You can learn more about using vinegar to tackle stubborn deposits with general cleaning tips on [how to clean mold with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-with-vinegar). While the Yocan Orbit doesn't develop mold, the principles of using vinegar for tough stains apply to stubborn reclaim.

## Cleaning the Yocan Orbit Base and Airpath

The main body or base of your Yocan Orbit houses the battery. It also contains critical internal connections and air pathways. This part should never be submerged in liquids. You will clean it differently from the glass or metal components. Proper cleaning of the base ensures good electrical contact and unobstructed airflow.

First, take a fresh cotton swab. Dip it lightly in isopropyl alcohol. Make sure the swab is damp, not dripping wet. Use this damp swab to carefully wipe around the 510 threading where the atomizer connects. Residue often accumulates here. Clean inside the threads to ensure a good connection. This helps the atomizer screw on smoothly.

Next, focus on the airpath holes. The Yocan Orbit needs clear airflow for proper vapor production. Use a dry pipe cleaner or a very thin, slightly damp cotton swab to gently poke into any visible air holes. Twist and push the pipe cleaner through the path to dislodge any blockages. Be careful not to push debris further inside the device. You want to bring it out.

Use another slightly damp cotton swab to wipe down the exterior of the battery base. Remove any fingerprints, dust, or sticky spots. Follow up with a dry paper towel to wipe away any excess moisture. Inspect the entire base for any lingering residue. Ensure all external surfaces are clean and dry. A clean base looks good and performs reliably.

## Reassembling and Testing Your Clean Yocan Orbit

After all parts are completely dry, you can reassemble your Yocan Orbit. This step is important. Make sure every piece is dry before putting it back together. Any moisture can cause short circuits or other problems. Take your time to ensure everything fits correctly.

Follow these steps for reassembly:
1.  **Reattach the Coil:** If you removed the TGT coil, carefully place it back into the atomizer housing. Make sure it sits securely. Do not overtighten if it screws in.
2.  **Screw on the Atomizer:** Gently screw the atomizer back onto the battery base. Twist it clockwise until it is finger-tight. Avoid forcing it, as this can damage the threading. A proper connection ensures the device powers on.
3.  **Place the Glass Attachment:** Carefully slide or twist the glass top attachment back onto the atomizer. Make sure it forms a snug seal. This prevents vapor from escaping and ensures proper airflow.
4.  **Reinsert Silicone Rings:** If you removed any silicone O-rings, put them back into their correct grooves. These rings provide seals and prevent leaks. Ensure they sit flat and are not twisted.

Once fully reassembled, perform a quick test. Turn on your Yocan Orbit. Cycle through the temperature settings if your model has them. This confirms the device powers on and the buttons work. Then, perform a "burn-off" cycle. Turn on the device without any concentrate inside. Let it heat up for a few seconds. This helps burn off any tiny residue or alcohol remnants. It prepares the device for your next session. Your Yocan Orbit is now clean and ready for use. Enjoy pure, flavorful vapor again.
