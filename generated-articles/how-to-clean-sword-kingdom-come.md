## Master Sword Cleaning in Kingdom Come Deliverance

You step into the shoes of Henry, a simple blacksmith's son, in the vast world of Bohemia. Survival in Kingdom Come: Deliverance means keeping your gear in top shape. Your sword is not just a weapon; it is your life. Learning how to clean your sword in Kingdom Come becomes a key skill for any player. This guide will show you how to maintain your blade. We will cover everything from simple cleaning to full repairs.

A well-maintained sword cuts better. It also looks good. A dirty or dull blade hurts your combat skills. It can also make people see you in a bad light. I will help you understand the game's mechanics. You will learn the best ways to keep your sword sharp and shining. This article outlines the importance of sword cleanliness. It details how to use grindstones and repair kits. It also explains when to visit a blacksmith.

### Takeaway:

*   **Grindstones:** Use grindstones to sharpen and clean your sword yourself.
*   **Repair Kits:** Carry various repair kits for quick fixes in the field.
*   **Blacksmiths:** Visit blacksmiths for professional repairs and deep cleaning.
*   **Prevent Damage:** Avoid unnecessary combat or environmental wear.
*   **Impact:** Cleanliness affects combat effectiveness, reputation, and charisma.

### How do you clean your sword in Kingdom Come?

You clean your sword in Kingdom Come: Deliverance mainly by using grindstones to sharpen and polish it yourself. You can also use weapon repair kits in your inventory for quick fixes. For more significant damage or thorough cleaning, visit a blacksmith or armorer in town. These methods keep your blade effective and looking good.

## Understanding Sword Condition in Kingdom Come

Your sword in Kingdom Come: Deliverance is more than just a weapon. It has a condition meter. This meter tells you how clean and sharp your sword is. A sword's condition drops with use. Fighting, hitting enemies, or even just carrying it around can cause wear. This wear shows as dirt, dullness, or even rust on your blade.

The game tracks two main aspects of your sword's state: durability and cleanliness. Durability refers to how much more damage the weapon can take before breaking. Cleanliness affects its cutting power and visual appeal. A sword at 100% condition is clean and sharp. A sword at 0% condition is broken and useless. You need to keep an eye on this meter.

A low condition sword will perform poorly in combat. It deals less damage. It also makes your attacks less effective. This can turn easy fights into hard ones. Your reputation can also suffer if you walk around with a dirty, broken weapon. People might see you as unkempt or poor. This affects prices in shops and how NPCs talk to you. You must pay attention to your gear's state.

It's important to know the difference between damage and dirt. Damage affects the sword's actual durability. Dirt affects its visual appearance and can also lower its effectiveness. Both lower the overall condition percentage. You need to address both issues for a fully functional and presentable weapon. Always check your inventory to see the exact condition of your sword.

### Effects of Poor Sword Condition

*   **Reduced Damage Output:** A dull blade cuts less effectively.
*   **Lowered Durability:** A damaged sword is closer to breaking.
*   **Negative Reputation:** NPCs may view you poorly.
*   **Impact on Charisma:** A dirty appearance reduces your charisma stats.
*   **Increased Repair Costs:** Waiting too long makes repairs more expensive.

## The Grindstone: Your Primary Tool for Sword Cleaning

The grindstone is the most common way to clean and sharpen your sword in Kingdom Come: Deliverance. You will find grindstones in almost every town. They are usually near blacksmiths or in public areas. Using a grindstone is a mini-game. It requires some practice to master. But once you learn, you can keep your sword in top shape for free.

To use a grindstone, you interact with it. Henry will then hold the sword to the wheel. You must move the sword up and down the wheel. You also need to rotate the blade. The goal is to sharpen both edges evenly. Look for sparks. Sparks show you are doing it right. If you see red, you are grinding too hard. This can damage your sword further.

You need to pay attention to the angles. The game provides visual cues. Keep the blade at the right angle. Move it slowly and steadily. Don't rush the process. A successful grind makes your sword sharper and removes dirt. It improves its condition percentage. This skill gets easier with practice. You will become a master sharpener over time.

Learning to use the grindstone saves you money. Blacksmiths charge for repairs. The grindstone costs nothing. It is an essential skill for any player. It helps you maintain your gear in the field. This way, you always have a sharp blade ready for battle. Practice on cheaper swords first if you are worried about damaging your main weapon.

### Steps for Using a Grindstone Effectively

1.  **Locate a Grindstone:** Find one in towns or larger camps.
2.  **Interact with it:** Press the action button to start the mini-game.
3.  **Position the Blade:** Move the sword onto the spinning wheel.
4.  **Find the Spark:** Adjust the angle and pressure until you see yellow sparks. This indicates the correct contact.
5.  **Grind Both Edges:** Move the blade up and down the wheel to sharpen the entire edge. Rotate the blade to sharpen the other side.
6.  **Avoid Red Sparks:** If you see red sparks, you are pressing too hard or at a wrong angle. This will damage your sword.
7.  **Check Condition:** Monitor the sword's condition bar on the screen. Stop when it reaches 100%.

## Repair Kits and Blacksmiths: Alternative Cleaning and Repair

Sometimes, a grindstone is not enough. Your sword might have significant damage. Or you might be far from a grindstone. This is where repair kits and blacksmiths come in handy. Both offer ways to clean and fix your sword. They are vital for long-term gear maintenance.

Weapon repair kits are consumable items. You can buy them from vendors. They let you fix your sword on the go. Open your inventory, select the repair kit, and then select your sword. Repair kits fix a certain percentage of damage. Different kits work for different item types. Make sure you have a "Weapon Repair Kit." These are great for minor damage or dirt. They save you a trip to town.

Blacksmiths and armorers offer professional services. They can fully repair and clean your sword. They can fix items that are too damaged for a repair kit. They can also fix items that you struggle to fix yourself. This service costs money. The cost depends on the item's current condition and its value. High-value, badly damaged swords cost more to repair. Visiting a blacksmith ensures your sword returns to perfect condition. They also sell new gear and repair kits.

I find it useful to carry a few repair kits. They are light. They can save you in a pinch. For serious damage, I always go to a blacksmith. They do a better job. They also improve your smithing skill. Your smithing skill makes your own repairs better over time.

### When to Use Each Method

*   **Light Dirt/Dullness:** Use a grindstone yourself for free.
*   **Minor Damage/Dirt in the Field:** Use a weapon repair kit from your inventory.
*   **Heavy Damage/Broken Sword:** Visit a blacksmith or armorer for a full repair.
*   **High-Value Weapons:** Always take expensive swords to a professional blacksmith for best results.
*   **Specific Blade Types:** Some specific blade types, like a Katana, have unique care requirements. For those, check a specialized guide like [how to clean a katana sword](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-katana-sword).

## Keeping Your Blade Pristine: Prevention and Maintenance

Preventing damage is always better than repairing it. You can do several things to keep your sword pristine in Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Thinking ahead saves you money and effort. It also means you always have a battle-ready weapon.

First, avoid unnecessary combat. Every hit you take or give uses up your weapon's durability. If you can sneak past enemies, do so. If you can talk your way out of a fight, choose that option. This reduces wear and tear on your sword. Use blunt weapons or your fists for training. This saves your sharp sword for real fights.

Second, be mindful of where you draw your sword. Dragging it through mud or water will make it dirty faster. Keep it sheathed when not in use. The game models environmental effects on your gear. A clean environment helps keep your gear clean. After a fight, quickly check your sword's condition. A small fix early on is easier than a major repair later.

Third, carry basic repair kits. Weapon repair kits are small. They are lightweight. They can fix minor damage or dirt on the spot. This stops small issues from becoming big problems. Regularly check your inventory. See the condition of all your gear. I make it a habit to check my gear after every major encounter. This ensures I am always prepared.

Finally, consider the "Maintenance" skill. As Henry's skills improve, his ability to repair items gets better. Investing skill points here makes your grindstone use more effective. It also makes repair kits work better. This skill also reduces the chance of damaging your items during self-repair. Being proactive about sword care makes a big difference.

### Smart Maintenance Habits

*   **Sheath Your Weapon:** Always keep your sword sheathed when not in combat to prevent accidental wear.
*   **Avoid Unnecessary Fights:** Choose stealth or dialogue when possible to preserve weapon durability.
*   **Regular Inspections:** Check your sword's condition after every significant encounter or quest.
*   **Carry Repair Kits:** Keep Weapon Repair Kits in your inventory for immediate, on-the-go fixes.
*   **Invest in Maintenance Skill:** Improve Henry's Maintenance skill to make self-repairs more effective.
*   **Cleanliness for Appearance:** Remember that dirt affects not just performance but also Henry's appearance and charisma. Keeping your appearance clean, like maintaining your shoes, can have similar positive effects on how people perceive you.

## Impact of Sword Cleanliness on Combat and Reputation

A clean sword does more than just look good in Kingdom Come: Deliverance. It directly impacts your combat effectiveness. It also influences your reputation with the people of Bohemia. These links are important for your journey as Henry. You need to understand them to succeed.

In combat, a clean and sharp sword deals more damage. It penetrates armor better. Your attacks land more often. A dull or dirty blade, on the other hand, performs poorly. It might bounce off armor. Your swings might feel weaker. This can make fights harder and longer. You use more stamina. You take more damage. Keeping your sword sharp gives you an edge in every fight. It makes a real difference in melee encounters.

Your sword's condition also affects your charisma and reputation. People notice how you present yourself. A knight with a gleaming sword shows status and care. A peasant with a rusty, battered blade looks poor and unkempt. This can impact quests. It can change how characters react to you. Shopkeepers might offer worse prices. Lords might treat you with less respect. Your appearance, including your weapon, speaks volumes about you.

I always try to keep my primary sword at 100% condition. It makes me feel more confident in a fight. It also helps in social situations. A good reputation opens up more opportunities. It can lead to better quest rewards. It might even get you discounts. So, cleaning your sword is not just about battle. It's about being a well-respected figure in the game world.

### Benefits of a Pristine Blade

*   **Increased Damage:** Deal maximum damage to enemies.
*   **Better Armor Penetration:** Cut through enemy defenses more easily.
*   **Improved Combat Flow:** Attacks feel smoother and more effective.
*   **Enhanced Charisma:** Your well-maintained appearance boosts your charisma stat.
*   **Positive Reputation:** NPCs view you more favorably, leading to better prices and quest outcomes.
*   **Reduced Stamina Drain:** A sharp sword requires less effort to use effectively, saving your stamina.

## Advanced Tips for Sword Care in Bohemia

Beyond the basics, there are some advanced tips for sword care in Kingdom Come: Deliverance. These strategies can further optimize your weapon maintenance. They help you stay ahead in the harsh world of Bohemia. I use these tips to keep my gear ready for anything.

Firstly, consider carrying multiple swords. You can have a "combat" sword and a "town" sword. Use your combat sword for fights. Keep your town sword in pristine condition. This ensures you always have a clean weapon for social interactions. It also prevents your best fighting blade from getting damaged when you don't need it. This takes up inventory space, but it's worth it for key moments.

Secondly, pay attention to the specific weapon type. Some swords, like longswords, are harder to keep at 100% condition due to their length and use. Other weapons, like daggers, might accumulate less damage. Understanding these nuances helps you prioritize which weapons need more frequent attention. Each weapon type has its own wear pattern.

Third, use the "maintenance" skill to your advantage. As Henry's maintenance skill grows, his ability to repair items improves dramatically. This includes using repair kits more effectively and reducing the risk of damaging items on a grindstone. Train this skill by repeatedly using grindstones and repair kits. It pays off in the long run.

Finally, explore the world for hidden grindstones or repair points. Not all repair spots are obvious. Sometimes, you find small camps with grindstones. Knowing these locations can save you from a long trip back to town. Always be on the lookout for useful resources that help you clean your sword.

### Strategic Maintenance Practices

*   **Weapon Specialization:** Consider having different swords for different purposes (e.g., a "social" sword, a "combat" sword).
*   **Skill Training:** Actively train your Maintenance skill to become better at self-repairs and grindstone use.
*   **Environmental Awareness:** Be mindful of where you fight and travel to avoid unnecessary dirt and damage.
*   **Looting and Selling:** Repair damaged weapons you loot before selling them. This increases their value and can help train your repair skills.
*   **Strategic Repairs:** Prioritize repairing your primary weapon first. Then repair secondary weapons or armor.
*   **Cleaning Your Arsenal:** Just as you clean your main sword, remember to clean other equipment. This includes your armor, shields, and even small items. Maintaining all your gear helps keep your inventory tidy and your stats optimal.

## Common Misconceptions About Sword Cleaning

There are some common misunderstandings about cleaning your sword in Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Clearing these up helps you maintain your gear more effectively. I want to make sure you have the right information.

One common misconception is that blacksmiths are the only way to repair and clean your sword. This is not true. You can use grindstones yourself for sharpening and cleaning. You can also use weapon repair kits for on-the-go fixes. Blacksmiths are for major repairs or when you prefer not to do it yourself. Relying only on blacksmiths can get expensive.

Another myth is that sword dirt is purely cosmetic. While some dirt is visual, it always affects the overall condition. This means it impacts performance. A dirty sword will not perform as well as a clean one, even if its durability is high. You must address both damage and dirt. Both contribute to the weapon's overall effectiveness.

Some players believe that only combat causes wear. This is also false. Simply drawing and sheathing your weapon, or even just having it equipped while running around, causes minor wear. Environmental factors like rain or mud can also contribute to dirt and slight damage. Your sword is always under some form of stress. Regular checks are a good idea.

Finally, people sometimes think that high-level smithing skill makes your sword invincible. While a high maintenance skill helps, no sword is truly invincible. All weapons will eventually degrade with use. The skill only makes your repairs better and more efficient. You still need to actively maintain your gear.

Understanding these points helps you approach sword maintenance with a clearer mind. It saves you time and resources in the game. Always check the in-game descriptions and tutorials for the most accurate information.
