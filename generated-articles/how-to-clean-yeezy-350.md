## How To Clean Yeezy 350: Keep Your Sneakers Spotless

Do your Yeezy 350 sneakers look a little dull? We all love our Yeezys. Their unique design and comfort make them a favorite for many. But like any footwear, they get dirty. Dust, dirt, and stains can quickly take away their fresh look. Knowing how to clean Yeezy 350 properly is key to keeping them sharp. You want to protect your investment and keep them looking new.

This guide will walk you through every step. We will cover the best tools and techniques. You will learn how to tackle different parts of the shoe. This includes the delicate Primeknit upper and the responsive Boost sole. My goal is to help you maintain your Yeezy 350s so they stay clean and last a long time. Get ready to bring back that factory fresh appeal to your beloved sneakers.

### Takeaway

*   Gather the right tools: soft brush, cleaning solution, microfibre cloths.
*   Always remove laces and insoles before cleaning.
*   Use gentle methods for the Primeknit upper.
*   Clean the Boost sole carefully to remove dirt and stains.
*   Air dry your Yeezys away from direct heat.

How to clean Yeezy 350 sneakers? You can clean Yeezy 350 sneakers using a soft-bristled brush, mild cleaning solution, and water. Focus on gently scrubbing the Primeknit upper and using a firmer approach for the Boost sole and outsole. Always air dry them afterward.

## Why Proper Yeezy 350 Cleaning Matters

Your Yeezy 350s are more than just shoes. They are a style statement and a comfortable pair for your feet. Cleaning them correctly helps in many ways. First, it keeps them looking great. A clean pair of Yeezys always stands out. Dirt and grime can make your expensive shoes look cheap and uncared for. Regular cleaning removes these visible marks.

Second, proper cleaning extends their life. Dirt particles can get into the shoe's materials. Over time, these particles can cause wear and tear. For instance, abrasive dirt on the Primeknit can weaken the fibers. Cleaning prevents this damage. It protects the integrity of the materials, especially the sensitive Primeknit and the soft Boost sole. This means your Yeezys will last longer.

Third, cleaning helps maintain hygiene. Shoes collect sweat, bacteria, and odors. A good cleaning process removes these things. This keeps your feet healthy and your shoes smelling fresh. Nobody wants smelly shoes. Lastly, it preserves their value. If you ever plan to resell your Yeezys, their condition matters greatly. A well-maintained, clean pair will always fetch a better price. Investing a little time in cleaning them pays off in the long run.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Tools for Yeezy 350s

Before you start cleaning your Yeezy 350s, you need the right supplies. Using the correct tools makes the process easier and safer for your shoes. You do not need many special items. Most of them you might already have at home. Having everything ready before you begin saves time and prevents interruptions.

First, you will need a soft-bristled brush. An old toothbrush works well for small areas and the Primeknit. A softer shoe brush is also good. You will also need a medium-bristled brush for tougher areas like the outsole. A small bowl or bucket for water is essential. Two microfibre cloths are also important. One will be for cleaning, and the other for drying.

For cleaning solutions, a mild laundry detergent or a dedicated sneaker cleaner is ideal. Avoid harsh chemicals. They can damage the materials of your Yeezys. Warm water will also be needed. Lastly, you might want some paper towels or a small towel. These help with absorbing excess moisture. Having these items ready ensures a smooth and effective cleaning session.

## Pre-Cleaning Steps for Your Yeezy 350 Sneakers

Starting your cleaning process with proper preparation is vital. These initial steps help protect your Yeezy 350s and make the deep cleaning more effective. Skipping these can lead to less effective cleaning or even damage. Take your time with this part. It sets the stage for a successful clean.

First, remove the laces and insoles from your Yeezys. This allows you to clean these parts separately. It also ensures you can reach all areas of the shoe. The laces often collect a lot of dirt. The insoles can absorb sweat and odors. Cleaning them individually is best. You can machine wash the laces in a mesh bag with mild detergent or hand wash them. For insoles, hand wash with soap and water, then let them air dry completely.

Next, get rid of any loose dirt or debris from the shoes. You can do this by tapping the shoes together gently over a trash can. Use a soft brush or a dry cloth to brush off any surface dirt. Pay attention to the grooves on the outsole. Dirt can get stuck there. This step prevents you from grinding dirt further into the material during the wet cleaning process. It also helps your cleaning solution work better on actual stains. These small steps make a big difference in the final result.

### Detaching Laces and Insoles

Removing laces and insoles is the first practical step. It gives you full access to the shoe's interior and exterior. Laces can be washed separately in a small bowl with soap or tossed into a laundry bag and machine washed on a gentle cycle. Insoles might need a gentle scrub with a soft brush and mild soap. Ensure both are fully dry before putting them back.

### Removing Loose Dirt

Before applying any liquid, gently brush off loose dirt. A dry soft-bristled brush works well for the Primeknit upper. For the Boost sole and outsole, a slightly stiffer brush or even a dry cloth can help. This prevents mud or large dirt pieces from turning into a muddy mess when water is added. Tap the shoes together to dislodge stubborn debris from the treads.

## Deep Cleaning the Primeknit Upper of Your Yeezy 350

The Primeknit upper is a signature feature of the Yeezy 350. It is lightweight and breathable but also delicate. Cleaning this part requires a gentle touch. Aggressive scrubbing or harsh chemicals can damage the fabric. My approach is always to start mild and only increase intensity if needed. This keeps the Primeknit looking good and intact.

Begin by mixing your cleaning solution. Use a small amount of mild detergent or sneaker cleaner with warm water in your bowl. Dip your soft-bristled brush into the solution. Make sure the brush is damp, not soaking wet. Excess water can be hard to dry and might leave water marks. Gently scrub the Primeknit in small, circular motions. Work on one section at a time. The goal is to lift the dirt, not push it deeper into the fabric.

For stubborn spots, apply a bit more solution directly to the brush. Avoid scrubbing too hard. Rinse your brush frequently to keep it clean. After scrubbing, use a clean, damp microfibre cloth to wipe away the suds and dirt. Wipe gently until all the cleaning solution is gone. You might need to rinse the cloth and wipe again a few times. This ensures no residue is left behind, which can attract more dirt later. Remember, patience is key here.

### Gentle Scrubbing Techniques

When cleaning the Primeknit, use very little pressure. Think of it as gently massaging the dirt out. Dip your soft brush, like a toothbrush, into your mild solution. Lightly flick excess water. Then, use small, soft circles on the fabric. Focus on one small area at a time. Rinse your brush often to avoid spreading dirt. This gentle method protects the knit from stretching or fraying.

### Removing Stains from Primeknit

For specific stains on the Primeknit, treat them quickly. A small drop of cleaning solution directly on the stain, gently dabbed with a clean cloth, can work. Avoid rubbing aggressively, as this can set the stain. For oil-based stains, a tiny bit of cornstarch can help absorb the oil before cleaning. Apply it, let it sit, then brush off before wet cleaning. Always test any new method on a hidden area first.

## Reviving the Boost Sole and Outsole of Your Yeezy 350

The Boost sole is another iconic part of the Yeezy 350. It provides comfort and cushioning. However, its textured surface can trap dirt easily. The outsole, the very bottom of the shoe, faces the most direct contact with the ground. These parts often need more vigorous cleaning than the Primeknit. My method focuses on thorough cleaning without damaging the Boost material.

Start with the Boost sole. Dip your medium-bristled brush into your cleaning solution. Unlike the Primeknit, you can apply a bit more pressure here. Scrub the Boost sole in various directions to get into all the crevices. The unique texture of the Boost can be challenging. Pay extra attention to yellowed areas or dark scuff marks. For particularly stubborn marks, you can use a small amount of undiluted cleaning solution directly on the spot, then scrub.

After cleaning the Boost, move to the outsole. This is the rubber part at the bottom. It can handle more scrubbing. Use your medium-bristled brush and cleaning solution to scrub away embedded dirt and grime. The grooves and patterns on the outsole often collect a lot of mud and small stones. Make sure you remove all debris from these areas. Rinse your brush frequently to avoid reapplying dirt. Once you are done scrubbing both the Boost and the outsole, wipe them down thoroughly with a clean, damp microfibre cloth. Ensure all soap residue is removed. A clean Boost sole brings back a lot of the shoe's original appeal. If you own other Yeezy models, similar cleaning principles apply to their soles, like when you [clean Yeezy Foam Runners](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-yeezy-foam-runners) or [clean Yeezy 700 MNVN](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-yeezy-700-mnvn).

### Tackling Yellowing on Boost Soles

Yellowing on Boost soles is a common issue, especially on white Boost. This happens from oxidation and dirt build-up. For light yellowing, regular deep cleaning can help. For more severe yellowing, you might need a specialized sole whitener product. These products often contain oxidizers. Apply them carefully as directed, usually with UV light exposure. Always follow product instructions closely to avoid damage. This method helps restore the bright white look.

### Cleaning the Rubber Outsole

The outsole is very durable. Use a medium or stiff brush with your cleaning solution. Apply good pressure to remove all dirt and grime from the treads. A toothpick or a small pick can help remove pebbles or debris stuck deep in the grooves. Rinse the outsole thoroughly with a damp cloth afterward. This ensures no dirt is left behind, giving you better traction and a cleaner look.

## Drying and Post-Cleaning Care for Yeezy 350s

After a good cleaning, proper drying is crucial. Incorrect drying can lead to damage, bad odors, or even mildew. Patience is key here. Never rush the drying process for your Yeezy 350s. My rule is always air dry. This preserves the materials and prevents shrinking or warping.

First, gently blot any excess water from the shoes with a clean, dry microfibre cloth. You want to remove as much surface moisture as possible. Next, stuff your Yeezys with paper towels or a shoe tree. This helps absorb internal moisture and maintains the shoe's original shape as it dries. Avoid using newspaper, as the ink can transfer onto the Primeknit. Change the paper towels every few hours if they become very damp.

Place your Yeezy 350s in a well-ventilated area. A spot with good airflow, away from direct sunlight or artificial heat sources, is perfect. Direct heat, like from a dryer or a radiator, can shrink the Primeknit or warp the Boost sole. It can also yellow the Boost material. Allow them to dry completely. This can take anywhere from 12 to 24 hours, depending on humidity. Once fully dry, you can reinsert the insoles and laces. Your Yeezys should look fresh and ready to wear. This gentle drying process ensures longevity and preserves the integrity of your beloved sneakers. Just as with [cleaning Yeezy slides](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-yeezy-slides), air drying is the safest choice.

### Air Drying Best Practices

Always air dry your Yeezys. Place them in an open space with good air circulation. You can put them near a fan, but not directly on top of a heating vent. Hanging them upside down can help water drain out. Make sure they are completely dry before you wear them again. Wearing damp shoes can cause odor and bacterial growth.

### Maintaining Shape During Drying

Stuffing your Yeezy 350s with paper towels or using shoe trees is important. This prevents the Primeknit from collapsing or shrinking as it dries. The paper towels also pull moisture from inside the shoe. Change damp paper towels as needed. This simple step helps your Yeezys keep their original form and fit.

## Advanced Tips and Stain Removal for Stubborn Yeezy 350 Marks

Sometimes, your Yeezy 350s encounter stains that are tougher than average dirt. These might be oil, ink, or grass stains. Dealing with these requires a slightly different approach. My experience shows that quick action and the right technique make a big difference. Do not lose hope if you see a tough stain.

For oil or grease stains on the Primeknit, act fast. Blot the excess oil with a paper towel. Then, sprinkle a generous amount of cornstarch or talcum powder directly on the stain. Let it sit for several hours, or even overnight. The powder will absorb the oil. After it has sat, gently brush off the powder. Then, proceed with your regular mild cleaning solution and soft brush. This often lifts the oil successfully.

Ink stains are trickier. For fresh ink, try dabbing with rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab. Apply only to the stain, working from the outside in to prevent spreading. Blot with a clean cloth. For dried ink, professional help might be needed. Grass stains often respond well to a mixture of baking soda and vinegar paste. Apply the paste, let it dry, then brush off and clean normally. Always test any new product or method on an inconspicuous area first. Prevention is also a great strategy. Using a water and stain repellent spray can add a protective layer to your Yeezys, making future cleanings easier. Just like [cleaning Yeezy 700 V3](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-yeezy-700-v3), careful stain removal protects the shoe's materials.

### Preventing Future Stains

Protecting your Yeezy 350s from future stains is a smart move. Using a quality sneaker protector spray is highly recommended. These sprays create a barrier that repels water and prevents stains from soaking into the Primeknit. Apply the spray to clean, dry shoes according to the product instructions. Reapply every few weeks or months, depending on wear. This proactive step saves you a lot of cleaning effort.

### Dealing with Tough Scuff Marks

Scuff marks, especially on the Boost sole, can be stubborn. For light scuffs, a magic eraser (melamine foam) can work wonders. Dampen the eraser and gently rub the scuff mark. The abrasive nature of the magic eraser helps lift the mark. Be very careful not to use it on the Primeknit, as it can damage the fabric. For deeper scuffs on the Boost, sometimes a dedicated sole cleaner or even a little bit of undiluted cleaning solution with a firm scrub can help.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you put Yeezy 350s in the washing machine?

It is generally not recommended to put Yeezy 350s in a washing machine. The delicate Primeknit material and the Boost sole can be damaged by the machine's agitation and heat. Machine washing can also cause the shoe to lose its shape, shrink, or detach glues. Hand cleaning is always the safest and most effective method to maintain your Yeezys.

### How often should I clean my Yeezy 350s?

The frequency of cleaning depends on how often you wear them and where. If you wear your Yeezy 350s regularly, a light clean once a week to remove surface dirt is good. A deep clean every 2-4 weeks is advisable, especially if they get heavily soiled. For occasional wear, clean them as needed when visible dirt appears.

### How do I remove yellowing from Yeezy 350 soles?

To remove yellowing from Yeezy 350 Boost soles, you can use specialized sole whitening products. These products typically contain chemicals that reverse oxidation. Apply the solution to the yellowed areas, cover with plastic wrap, and expose to UV light (sunlight) for a few hours. Always follow the product's specific instructions for the best results and to avoid damage.

### What cleaning products are safe for Yeezy 350s?

Mild cleaning solutions are safe for Yeezy 350s. This includes diluted laundry detergent, mild dish soap, or dedicated sneaker cleaning solutions. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach, strong stain removers, or industrial cleaners. These can discolor, weaken, or damage the Primeknit and Boost materials. Always choose gentle, pH-neutral options.

### Can I use bleach on my Yeezy 350s?

No, you should never use bleach on your Yeezy 350s. Bleach is a very strong chemical. It can damage the Primeknit fabric by weakening its fibers and causing discoloration. It can also react negatively with the Boost material, leading to irreversible yellowing or degradation. Stick to mild, non-bleach cleaning solutions.

### How to dry Yeezy 350s properly?

To dry Yeezy 350s properly, always air dry them. After cleaning, blot excess water with a clean cloth. Stuff the shoes with paper towels to absorb moisture and maintain shape. Place them in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or artificial heat sources like radiators or dryers. Allow them to dry completely, which can take up to 24 hours.

## Conclusion

Keeping your Yeezy 350s clean is simple when you know the right steps. We have covered everything from gathering your tools to tackling stubborn stains. Remember, gentle care is crucial for the delicate Primeknit, while the Boost sole can handle a bit more attention. My advice is to always use mild solutions and let your sneakers air dry naturally. This protects their materials and extends their life.
