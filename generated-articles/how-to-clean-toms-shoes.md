## Keep Your Toms Fresh: How To Clean Toms Shoes

Toms shoes are known for their comfort and simple style. We wear them often. This means they can get dirty quickly. Dirt, stains, and odors are common problems. Cleaning them properly keeps them looking good. It also helps them last longer. Many people wonder how to clean Toms shoes safely. This guide will show you how. We will cover different materials. You will learn the best methods for each type. I will share tips for deep cleaning and spot treatments. This article helps you keep your Toms in top shape.

### Takeaway:
*   Identify your Toms' material before cleaning.
*   Hand wash canvas Toms with mild soap and cold water.
*   Spot clean suede and leather Toms carefully, avoiding water.
*   Air dry all Toms away from direct heat or sunlight.
*   Address specific stains and odors promptly for best results.

Cleaning Toms shoes involves gentle methods tailored to their material. Canvas Toms respond well to hand washing with mild soap and cold water. For suede or leather Toms, spot cleaning with specialized brushes or cleaners is best. Avoid machine washing for most Toms. Always air dry your shoes to maintain their shape and prevent damage.

## Understanding Your Toms Shoe Materials

Knowing what your Toms are made of is the first step. This decides the best cleaning method. Toms come in various materials. Each needs special care. Using the wrong method can damage your shoes.

Most classic Toms are made from canvas. This material is durable but absorbs dirt easily. Canvas is generally simple to clean. However, it can shrink or fade with hot water. Other Toms models use suede, leather, or synthetic fabrics. Suede feels soft and fuzzy. It requires dry cleaning methods. Leather is smooth and needs conditioning. Synthetic materials vary. They often mimic other fabrics. I always check the tag inside my shoes first. This tag usually tells you the material. If there is no tag, look at the shoe's texture. This helps you identify the fabric. You want to match the cleaning process to the material for good results.

## Preparing Your Toms for Cleaning

Proper preparation makes cleaning easier. It also protects your shoes. Do not skip these steps. They remove loose dirt and protect delicate parts. A little effort here saves big trouble later.

First, remove any loose dirt. Take your Toms outside. Gently clap the soles together. This knocks off dried mud and debris. You can also use a soft-bristled brush. A dry toothbrush works well for crevices. Next, take out the insoles if they are removable. Many Toms have removable insoles. Cleaning insoles separately prevents odor and mildew. You can often hand wash these. Set them aside for later. Finally, remove any laces or embellishments. These can get tangled or damaged during cleaning. Wash laces separately. This ensures a thorough clean for every part of your Toms. This simple preparation sets you up for a successful cleaning session.

## Cleaning Canvas Toms: Step-by-Step Guide

Cleaning canvas Toms is straightforward. This material is forgiving. Follow these steps for a deep clean. You will see your Toms look much brighter. This method works for most fabric Toms too.

### Hand Washing Canvas Toms

Hand washing is the safest method for canvas Toms. It lets you control the water and pressure. This prevents damage to the shoe's structure. I always choose hand washing over machine washing for my canvas pairs. It gives me peace of mind.

*   **Gather Supplies:** You need a bowl, cold water, mild detergent (like dish soap or laundry detergent), a soft brush, and clean towels. Do not use harsh chemicals.
*   **Pre-Soak (Optional):** If your Toms are very dirty, you can soak them. Fill a basin with cold water. Add a tiny amount of mild detergent. Submerge the Toms for 10-15 minutes. This helps loosen stubborn dirt.
*   **Gentle Scrubbing:** Empty the basin. Apply a small amount of detergent directly onto the wet shoe. Use your soft brush to gently scrub the canvas. Focus on dirty areas. Scrub in small circles. Be careful around the espadrille sole. This part is delicate.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the Toms under cold running water. Make sure all soap is gone. Soap residue can leave marks. It can also attract new dirt. Squeeze out excess water gently. Do not twist the shoes.
*   **Inner Shoe Clean:** Do not forget the inside. You can also [clean the inside of shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes) at this stage. Use a cloth with diluted detergent. Wipe the footbed and lining. Rinse the cloth and wipe again. This removes sweat and grime.

This hand washing method keeps your canvas Toms in great condition. They will feel fresh again.

### Machine Washing Canvas Toms (Use with Caution)

Machine washing Toms is possible but risky. It can cause shrinking or damage. I only recommend this if hand washing is not enough. Always follow these specific precautions.

*   **Protect Your Shoes:** Place your Toms in a mesh laundry bag. This protects them from the machine's agitator. It also prevents them from banging around. This step is very important.
*   **Use Cold Water:** Set your washing machine to a gentle cycle. Choose cold water only. Hot water can shrink the canvas. It can also cause colors to bleed.
*   **Mild Detergent:** Use a small amount of mild laundry detergent. Avoid bleach or harsh cleaners. These can damage the fabric.
*   **Air Dry Immediately:** Remove Toms from the washer at once. Do not put them in the dryer. The heat will damage them. Place them somewhere to air dry right away. For more general advice on machine cleaning, consider reading our guide on [how to clean shoes in the washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer).

Only use machine washing as a last resort. Hand washing is always the better choice for the longevity of your Toms.

## Cleaning Suede and Leather Toms: Specialized Care

Suede and leather Toms need different care. Water can damage these materials. You must use dry cleaning methods. This approach keeps them looking good.

### Caring for Suede Toms

Suede is delicate. It easily picks up dirt and stains. Water can leave permanent marks. Always use specialized products for suede.

*   **Dry Brush First:** Use a suede brush to remove loose dirt. Brush in one direction. This lifts the nap of the suede. It also removes dust. This is your first line of defense.
*   **Spot Cleaning Stains:** For stains, use a suede eraser. Gently rub the eraser over the stain. This lifts dirt without wetting the suede. Work slowly and patiently. If the stain is stubborn, you might need a specialized suede cleaner. Apply it sparingly. Do not saturate the material.
*   **Dealing with Water Marks:** If water spots appear, lightly mist the entire shoe with water. Then, blot with a clean cloth. Brush the suede once it dries. This can help even out the color. For more detailed instructions on leather care, you can refer to our article on [how to clean leather shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-leather-shoes). Suede is a type of leather, so some principles apply.
*   **Protecting Suede:** After cleaning, use a suede protector spray. This forms a barrier against future stains. Reapply it periodically. This extra step really helps.

Always test any cleaner on a hidden spot first. This ensures it does not cause discoloration. Suede needs gentle handling.

### Maintaining Leather Toms

Leather Toms are more robust than suede. Yet, they still need proper care. Water can still stain leather. Always use products made for leather.

*   **Wipe Down:** Use a damp cloth to wipe away surface dirt. Use only a slightly damp cloth. Do not soak the leather. Dry immediately with a clean, dry cloth.
*   **Leather Cleaner:** For deeper cleaning, use a dedicated leather cleaner. Apply a small amount to a soft cloth. Gently rub it into the leather. Follow the product instructions carefully. This cleans the surface without harming the material.
*   **Conditioning:** After cleaning, condition the leather. Leather conditioner keeps the material soft and prevents cracks. Apply a small amount and buff with a clean cloth. This step is crucial for leather longevity.
*   **Addressing Scuffs:** Small scuffs can often be buffed out. Use a soft cloth and gentle pressure. For deeper scuffs, a leather repair kit might be needed. This restores the shoe's appearance.

Regular maintenance keeps leather Toms looking new. It also extends their lifespan. Treat your leather Toms with care.

## Tackling Common Toms Shoe Stains and Odors

Toms shoes are prone to common issues like stains and smells. Knowing how to handle these makes a big difference. Quick action is important for success.

### Removing Stubborn Stains

Different stains need different approaches. Act fast for the best results. Do not let stains set.

*   **Mud Stains:** Let mud dry completely. Then, brush off as much as you can. For canvas, use the hand washing method. For suede, use a suede brush and eraser. If your shoes are very muddy, you might want to look at our guide on [how to clean muddy shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-muddy-shoes) for more tips.
*   **Oil and Grease Stains:** For canvas, sprinkle cornstarch or baking soda on the stain. Let it sit for several hours. This absorbs the oil. Then, brush it off and hand wash. For suede, apply cornstarch or talcum powder. Let it sit overnight. Brush it off in the morning. Repeat if necessary.
*   **Ink Stains:** For canvas, use rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab. Dab the stain. Do not rub. Rubbing can spread the ink. Rinse with cold water. Repeat as needed. For suede, this is very difficult. A professional cleaner might be best. Our article on [how to clean stained shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stained-shoes) provides more general stain removal advice applicable to various shoe types.
*   **Grass Stains:** For canvas, mix hydrogen peroxide with water. Dab the stain. Rinse thoroughly. For tough stains on white Toms, you can also check out our tips on [how to clean white shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes).

Always test any stain remover in an inconspicuous area first. This prevents damage or discoloration. Patience is key when removing stains.

### Eliminating Odors from Toms

Toms can get smelly, especially without socks. Odor comes from bacteria. Eliminating odors makes your shoes pleasant to wear again.

*   **Baking Soda Method:** Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda inside each shoe. Let it sit overnight, or even for 24 hours. Baking soda absorbs odors. Then, shake out the powder. You can also vacuum it out.
*   **Sunshine and Fresh Air:** Place your Toms in direct sunlight for a few hours. UV rays kill bacteria. Fresh air also helps ventilate the shoes. Do this on a dry, sunny day.
*   **Essential Oils (Caution):** A few drops of tea tree oil or lavender oil on a cotton ball placed inside the shoe can help. These have antibacterial properties. Be careful not to let the oil touch the fabric directly. This can stain.
*   **Odor Eliminating Sprays:** Use a shoe deodorizer spray. These products are designed to neutralize odors. Follow the product instructions.
*   **Preventive Measures:** Wear socks with your Toms. Rotate your shoes so they can air out between wears. This is the best way to prevent future odors. For more extensive methods to remove bad smells, read our guide on [how to clean smelly shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes).

Dealing with odors quickly keeps your Toms fresh. Regular prevention is even better.

## Drying and Maintaining Your Toms Shoes

Proper drying and ongoing maintenance are crucial. These steps prevent damage and keep your Toms looking good. Do not rush the drying process.

### The Importance of Proper Drying

Incorrect drying can cause shrinkage, mold, or warping. Always air dry your Toms. This maintains their shape and material integrity.

*   **Avoid Direct Heat:** Never put Toms in a dryer. The heat will shrink canvas and damage espadrille soles. It can also crack leather. Keep them away from radiators or direct sunlight.
*   **Stuff with Paper:** Stuff your Toms with paper towels or crumpled newspaper. This helps absorb moisture. It also helps maintain the shoe's shape as it dries. Change the paper when it gets damp.
*   **Air Dry Completely:** Place your Toms in a well-ventilated area. This could be indoors or outdoors in the shade. Allow them to dry completely. This can take 24-48 hours. Make sure they are totally dry before wearing them. Wearing damp shoes can lead to bad odors or mildew.

Patience during drying pays off. It protects your investment.

### Long-Term Care Tips

Regular care extends the life of your Toms. A little effort goes a long way. These simple habits keep your shoes in top condition.

*   **Spot Clean Regularly:** Do not wait for a full wash. Wipe off small marks as they happen. This prevents stains from setting.
*   **Rotate Your Shoes:** Do not wear the same pair of Toms every day. Giving them a rest allows them to air out. This reduces odor buildup.
*   **Use Shoe Trees:** For leather or structured Toms, use shoe trees. They help maintain shape. They also absorb moisture.
*   **Storage:** Store your Toms in a cool, dry place. Avoid damp basements or hot closets. Use dust bags for long-term storage. This protects them from dust and light.
*   **Protectant Sprays:** Consider using a water and stain repellent spray. Apply it after cleaning and drying. This adds an extra layer of protection. It is especially useful for canvas and suede.

## FAQs About Cleaning Toms Shoes

### Can I put my Toms in the washing machine?
You can machine wash canvas Toms on a gentle cycle with cold water. Always put them in a mesh laundry bag first. This protects them from damage. However, hand washing is generally safer. It reduces the risk of shrinking or sole damage. Avoid machine washing for suede, leather, or wool Toms.

### How do I remove stains from the espadrille sole?
The espadrille sole is delicate. Use a small brush, like an old toothbrush, with a tiny amount of mild soap and cold water. Gently scrub the stained area. Do not soak the sole. Rinse with a damp cloth. Let it air dry completely. Be careful not to unravel the fibers.

### What should I do if my Toms get moldy?
If your Toms get moldy, first brush off any dry mold outdoors. For canvas, mix equal parts water and white vinegar. Dab the solution onto the mold with a cloth. For deeper mold, refer to our comprehensive guide on [how to clean mold off shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-shoes). Air dry completely in a well-ventilated area. For suede or leather, consult a professional.

### Can I use bleach on white Toms?

### How often should I clean my Toms?
Clean your Toms as needed. Spot clean minor dirt and stains right away. For a full clean, do it when they appear noticeably dirty or start to smell. This might be every few weeks or months, depending on how often you wear them. Regular maintenance prevents heavy buildup.

### My Toms shrunk after washing, what can I do?
If your canvas Toms shrunk, it usually means the water was too hot or they were machine dried. Try wetting them again with cold water. While damp, wear them around the house for a bit. This can help stretch them back to size. Air dry them on your feet if possible.
