## Keep Your White NMD Shoes Spotless

My white NMD shoes are a favorite in my collection. They offer unmatched comfort and a sleek style. However, their bright white color makes them show dirt quickly. Keeping white NMD shoes clean is a common challenge for many owners. Dirt, mud, and daily wear can dull their pristine look fast.

This article provides a complete guide to help you restore your NMDs. We will cover essential tools and simple steps. You will learn how to clean Primeknit uppers and bright white Boost soles. We also discuss tackling tough stains and protecting your shoes from future dirt. Get ready to make your white NMDs look new again.

### Takeaway

*   Gather the right tools like soft brushes and gentle cleaning solutions.
*   Clean Primeknit uppers with light scrubbing and mild soap.
*   Restore Boost soles using baking soda paste or specific sole cleaners.
*   Address stubborn stains immediately for best results.
*   Always air dry your NMDs away from direct heat or sunlight.
*   Apply protective sprays to prevent future dirt and stains.

To clean white NMD shoes, first remove loose dirt. Then, use a mild soap solution and a soft brush to gently scrub the Primeknit upper. For the Boost sole, apply a cleaning paste or dedicated sole cleaner. Rinse gently, and air dry away from heat.

### Understanding Your White NMDs: Materials Matter

Before you start cleaning, it is important to know the materials of your white NMD shoes. NMDs feature specific components. Each part requires a different cleaning approach. Understanding these materials helps you clean effectively without causing damage.

The upper part of most white NMD shoes uses Primeknit. This is a woven textile material. It offers flexibility and breathability. Primeknit can absorb liquids and dirt easily due to its woven structure. You need gentle methods for this delicate fabric. Harsh scrubbing or strong chemicals can damage the fibers.

The midsole of NMDs uses Boost technology. This is a soft, foamy material. It provides excellent comfort and energy return. White Boost soles are famous for attracting dirt and yellowing over time. They often need specific cleaning techniques to restore their bright white color. Standard shoe cleaners might not be enough for Boost.

The outsole is typically made of rubber. This part contacts the ground most directly. It collects mud, grime, and small stones. Rubber outsoles are more durable than Primeknit or Boost. You can use firmer brushes on them. Knowing these material differences is the first step. It ensures you use the right cleaning tools and solutions for each part of your white NMDs. This detailed understanding helps to keep your sneakers in top condition.

### Gathering Your NMD Cleaning Toolkit

Having the right tools makes cleaning your white NMD shoes much easier. You do not need many specialized items. Most are simple household products. Preparing your toolkit beforehand saves time and ensures you have everything ready. This prevents mid-cleaning interruptions.

First, you need a soft-bristle brush. An old toothbrush works perfectly for delicate areas. You also need a medium-bristle brush for tougher spots like the outsole. Avoid stiff wire brushes. They can scratch or damage the materials. A soft cloth or microfiber towel is essential for wiping and drying.

For cleaning solutions, start with mild dish soap and warm water. You can also buy specialized sneaker cleaning kits. These kits often include gentle cleaning agents designed for various shoe materials. A small bowl for mixing solutions is helpful. For the Boost sole, consider baking soda or a magic eraser. These items effectively tackle scuffs and yellowing.

You might also want some paper towels or old newspapers. These are useful for stuffing shoes to help them keep their shape during drying. They also absorb excess moisture. A protective spray is a good investment for after-cleaning care. This helps repel water and stains in the future. With these simple items, you are ready to tackle any dirt on your white NMDs. Having all these tools ready ensures a smooth and effective cleaning process for your beloved sneakers.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning NMD Uppers (Primeknit)

Cleaning the Primeknit upper of your white NMD shoes requires a gentle touch. This material is soft and can be sensitive to harsh methods. Follow these steps to clean your NMD uppers effectively and safely. You will help maintain their structure and color.

**1. Remove Loose Dirt:** First, remove any large chunks of dirt or mud. Use a soft-bristle brush or an old toothbrush. Gently brush the entire upper. Make sure to get into the crevices of the Primeknit. This step prevents rubbing dirt further into the fabric during washing.

**2. Prepare Cleaning Solution:** Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water in a bowl. Create a foamy solution. You can also use a dedicated sneaker cleaner designed for knit materials. Test the solution on a small, hidden area first. This checks for any adverse reactions.

**3. Gentle Scrubbing:** Dip your soft-bristle brush into the cleaning solution. Tap off any excess liquid. Lightly scrub the Primeknit upper in small, circular motions. Do not press too hard. Focus on dirty spots, but clean the entire upper for an even finish. The goal is to lift the dirt, not to grind it in.

**4. Wipe and Rinse:** Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth to wipe away the soap and dirt. Rinse the cloth often to keep it clean. Do not submerge the entire shoe in water. This prevents saturating the interior. Repeat the scrubbing and wiping process as needed until the upper looks clean.

This gentle cleaning method will keep your NMD uppers looking fresh.

### Restoring the Brightness: Cleaning NMD Boost Soles

The white Boost sole is a signature feature of NMDs. It provides comfort but also attracts dirt and can yellow over time. Restoring its bright white appearance is crucial for making your shoes look new. This material requires specific attention.

**1. Initial Wipe-Down:** Begin by wiping the Boost sole with a damp cloth. This removes loose dirt and surface grime. Use a little mild soap if needed for the first pass. This prepares the surface for deeper cleaning.

**2. Tackle Scuffs and Stains:** For scuff marks and light dirt, a magic eraser works wonders. Dampen the magic eraser slightly. Gently rub it over the scuffed areas on the Boost sole. You will see the marks lift away. Be careful not to rub too aggressively.

**3. Deep Cleaning Yellowed Soles:** If your Boost soles have yellowed, a baking soda paste is effective. Mix baking soda with a small amount of water to form a thick paste. Apply this paste directly onto the yellowed areas of the Boost sole. Use an old toothbrush to gently scrub the paste into the material. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes. The baking soda helps to lift the discoloration.

**4. Rinse and Dry:** After the paste has set, use a clean, damp cloth to wipe off the baking soda. You might need to rinse the cloth multiple times. Ensure all residue is gone. For stubborn rubber soles, you can also check our guide on [how to clean white rubber shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-rubber-shoes). This will bring back the original brightness of your NMD Boost soles. Your shoes will look much better with a clean sole.

### Tackling Stubborn Stains on White NMDs

Stubborn stains are inevitable on white NMD shoes. Mud, grass, and grease can leave unsightly marks. Acting quickly and using the right method is key to successful stain removal. Different stains require different approaches.

**1. Mud Stains:** Let mud dry completely on your shoes. Once dry, gently brush off as much as possible with a stiff brush. Do not rub wet mud. This pushes the dirt deeper into the fabric. After removing the dry mud, clean the remaining stain with a mild soap and water solution. Use a soft brush. For persistent mud, check our specific guide on [how to clean mud off white shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mud-off-white-shoes).

**2. Grass Stains:** Grass stains contain chlorophyll, which can be tough to remove. Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol to a clean cloth. Gently dab the grass stain. Work from the outside of the stain inwards. This prevents spreading the stain. Follow up with a mild soap and water wash.

**3. Oil or Grease Stains:** These stains need immediate action. Sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder directly onto the fresh oil stain. Let it sit for several hours or overnight. The powder absorbs the oil. Then, brush off the powder. Follow with a gentle cleaning solution. For tough grease, a small amount of laundry detergent applied directly can help.

**4. General Stubborn Dirt:** For general, deep-set dirt or minor yellowing on the Primeknit, you can try specific cleaners. A paste of OxiClean and water can be very effective. Apply it, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then gently scrub and rinse. Learn more about using OxiClean in our guide on [how to clean white shoes with OxiClean](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes-with-oxiclean). Alternatively, a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution can help brighten whites. Mix one part hydrogen peroxide with two parts water. Apply to the stained area with a cloth, let it sit briefly, then rinse. Read more about this method in our article on [how to clean white shoes with hydrogen peroxide](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes-with-hydrogen-peroxide). Always rinse thoroughly after treating stains.

### Drying Your NMDs Safely and Effectively

Proper drying is as important as the cleaning itself. Incorrect drying methods can damage your white NMD shoes. They can lead to shrinking, warping, or a lingering musty smell. Always prioritize air drying to preserve your shoes.

After cleaning, remove the laces and insoles from your NMDs. This allows air to circulate better. It also ensures the inside dries completely. If insoles are wet, clean them separately and let them air dry as well.

Stuff your cleaned NMDs with white paper towels or old newspaper. Avoid colored newspaper, as ink can transfer onto white shoes. The paper helps absorb moisture from inside the shoe. It also helps your shoes maintain their original shape as they dry. Change the paper every few hours if it becomes very damp.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area. Choose a spot away from direct sunlight or artificial heat sources. Direct sunlight can cause white materials to yellow faster. High heat from radiators or dryers can shrink or crack the Primeknit and Boost sole. Allow plenty of time for your shoes to dry naturally. This can take 24 to 48 hours, depending on humidity levels. Patience here protects your investment. Once completely dry, reinsert the insoles and laces. Your white NMDs are now ready to wear or store.

### Protecting Your White NMDs: Prevention is Key

Preventing dirt and stains is easier than cleaning them. Proactive measures help keep your white NMD shoes looking fresh for longer. Integrating simple protection steps into your routine extends their life. This also reduces the frequency of deep cleaning.

**1. Apply a Water and Stain Repellent Spray:** This is the first line of defense. Purchase a quality sneaker protection spray. These sprays create an invisible barrier on the shoe's surface. This barrier repels water, dirt, and stains. Apply the spray to clean, dry shoes. Follow the product instructions carefully. Often, you apply multiple light coats. Let each coat dry fully before applying the next. Reapply the spray every few weeks or months. This depends on how often you wear your shoes.

**2. Regular Wiping and Spot Cleaning:** Do not wait for dirt to build up. After each wear, give your white NMDs a quick wipe-down. Use a soft, damp cloth to remove any fresh dirt or dust. Address small scuffs or marks immediately. A quick spot clean with a magic eraser or mild soap can prevent stains from setting. This regular maintenance keeps your shoes looking presentable.

**3. Choose Your Wearing Environment Wisely:** Try to avoid wearing your white NMDs in harsh conditions. Muddy paths, heavy rain, or dusty environments are not ideal. Save them for drier, cleaner outings. This simple choice significantly reduces exposure to dirt.

**4. Proper Storage:** Store your white NMDs in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Using shoe trees or stuffing them with acid-free paper helps maintain their shape. Proper storage prevents dust accumulation and yellowing. By adopting these preventive habits, you reduce the effort needed to maintain your white NMDs.

### Deep Cleaning and Machine Washing White NMDs

Sometimes, your white NMD shoes need more than a simple surface clean. For heavily soiled shoes, deep cleaning methods may be necessary. Machine washing is an option for NMDs, but you must do it with extreme caution. This method carries risks for the shoe's structure and materials.

**When to Consider Machine Washing:** Only machine wash your NMDs if they are extremely dirty. Consider it if hand cleaning has not removed tough stains. This should be a last resort. Do not machine wash frequently. Frequent washing can damage the delicate Primeknit and Boost materials.

**Steps for Safe Machine Washing:**
**1. Prepare the Shoes:** Remove the laces and insoles first. Brush off any loose dirt or mud. Place your NMDs inside a mesh laundry bag. This protects them from harsh tumbling inside the machine. You can also add some old towels to the wash. This provides cushioning and balances the load.

**2. Use Cold Water and Mild Detergent:** Set your washing machine to a delicate or hand wash cycle. Use cold water only. Hot water can cause shrinking or warping. Add a small amount of mild, liquid laundry detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals or bleach. Bleach can damage the fabric and cause yellowing.

**3. No Spin Cycle:** If your machine allows, select a setting with no spin cycle. The high speed of the spin cycle can stress and damage the shoe's materials. If a no-spin option is not available, choose the lowest spin setting.

**4. Air Dry Only:** Never put your NMDs in a dryer. High heat will cause irreversible damage. Always air dry them, following the safe drying methods discussed earlier. Stuff them with paper towels to absorb moisture and maintain shape. This process helps to deep clean your NMDs effectively.
