Hard Rock Stadium enforces a clear bag policy for all events. This rule helps keep everyone safe and allows for faster entry. Security staff can easily see what is inside your bag without opening it. This speeds up the screening process at the gates.

The policy limits the size and type of bags guests can bring. It applies to all major events, including Miami Dolphins games and concerts.

Knowing what bags you can bring is key to a smooth entry. Hard Rock Stadium strictly follows its clear bag policy. Here are the specific types of bags allowed inside the venue.

*   **Clear Tote Bags:** These are the most common type of accepted bag. They must be clear plastic, vinyl, or PVC. The maximum size for these bags is 12” x 6” x 12”. You can find these bags easily online or at many retail stores.
*   **Small Clutch Bags:** You can bring a small clutch bag or purse. This bag does not need to be clear. Its size must not exceed 4.5” x 6.5”. This is roughly the size of a hand, and it can contain your personal items like a phone, keys, and cards. Many people prefer to use these for quick access items.
*   **One-Gallon Plastic Freezer Bags:** A simple clear one-gallon plastic freezer bag (like a Ziploc bag) is also permitted. This is a very convenient option for those who want to carry minimal items. It meets all the clear bag requirements easily.
*   **Exceptions for Medical and Diaper Bags:** Guests with medical needs may bring necessary medical equipment. This includes bags for medications or other health-related items. Parents with infants may bring a diaper bag. These bags are subject to a thorough inspection at a designated gate. You should clearly indicate your medical or family need upon arrival to staff.

Remember, each guest is allowed one clear bag and one small clutch bag. This policy ensures security while still allowing you to carry essentials.

### Prohibited Items and Bag Exceptions

While many items enhance your stadium experience, some are simply not allowed. Hard Rock Stadium lists specific items and bag types that are prohibited for security reasons. Understanding this list helps you avoid delays at the gate. My advice is always to leave questionable items at home.

    *   **Fanny Packs (Non-Clear/Oversized):** While small fanny packs might be similar to a clutch, if they are not clear or exceed the 4.5" x 6.5" clutch size, they are not permitted. It is better to err on the side of caution.

Fans attending Dolphins games should always adhere to the 12" x 6" x 12" clear bag rule and the small clutch exception. This ensures a consistent experience across all NFL venues.
