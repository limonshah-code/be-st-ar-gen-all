## Draining Your Inground Pool Below the Skimmer

Winter approaches, or maybe your pool needs a serious repair. You know you need to lower the water level. But how do you drain an inground pool specifically below the skimmer? This task is important for many pool owners. It protects your pool from freezing damage or allows for vital equipment work.

This guide will show you how to drain your inground pool below the skimmer. We will discuss the right tools and safe methods. We cover using your main drain or a submersible pump. You will learn about important steps and safety tips. Let's get your pool ready.

### Takeaway

*   Understand why draining below the skimmer is important for your inground pool.
*   Choose the right draining method: using your main drain or a submersible pump.
*   Always plan where to discharge the pool water safely.
*   Take precautions to protect your pool structure and equipment during the draining process.

To drain an inground pool below the skimmer, use a submersible pump or your pool's main drain connected to the filter's waste setting. Ensure proper water disposal, monitor the level, and take precautions against structural damage, especially during winterization.

## Understanding Why You Need to Drain Your Inground Pool Below the Skimmer

You might wonder why dropping your pool's water level below the skimmer line is necessary. This specific level serves a key purpose. It helps prepare your pool for different situations. Each reason centers on protecting your pool and its systems.

Knowing the 'why' helps you understand the 'how'. It ensures you perform the task correctly. You want to avoid future problems with your pool.

### Winterization and Freeze Protection

Protecting your pool from winter damage is a primary reason to drain water below the skimmer. In colder climates, water expands when it freezes. This expansion can crack your skimmer's housing. It can also damage the pipes connected to it. These pipes are often close to the surface and prone to freezing.

Lowering the water prevents this. It moves water away from vulnerable components. This step is crucial for safe winterizing. You protect costly parts of your pool system.

### Equipment Repairs and Maintenance

Sometimes, pool equipment needs attention. A common repair might involve your skimmer itself. You cannot fix a leaky skimmer line with water flowing into it. Draining the water below the skmer allows you to access this part. It makes repairs possible.

Other equipment, like certain jets or lights, sit just below the water line. Draining below the skimmer gives you clear access. This makes maintenance much easier and safer. You can perform precise work without battling the water.

### Extensive Cleaning or Liner Replacement

If your pool needs a deep clean, draining below the skimmer helps. This lets you thoroughly clean pool walls. You can address stubborn algae or stains that sit near the waterline. It prepares the surface for a fresh start. [Learn how to clean algae from pool](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-algae-from-pool) before you start.

For vinyl liner pools, sometimes the liner needs replacement or significant repair. You must drain the water below the skimmer to do this. This allows the liner to be pulled back or completely removed. It ensures the new liner fits correctly.

## Essential Tools and Equipment for Effective Pool Draining

Draining your inground pool effectively requires the right tools. Having everything ready before you start saves time. It also prevents frustration. I always check my equipment first.

This section covers the basic tools you will need. Each item plays a role in a smooth draining process. You want reliable equipment for this task.

### Submersible Pumps: Your Primary Tool

A submersible pump is often the best way to drain an inground pool below the skimmer. This pump sits directly in the water. It pushes water out through a hose. Pumps come in various sizes, measured by gallons per hour (GPH).

Choosing the right size matters. A larger pump drains faster. I recommend a pump with a flow rate of at least 2,000 GPH for most residential pools. You will also need a long power cord and a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) for safety.

### Hoses and Discharge Management

You need a durable hose to move the water away from your pool. A standard garden hose is too small and slow. Look for a backwash hose or a lay-flat discharge hose. These are wider, often 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter. They handle large water volumes.

Planning your discharge area is very important. You cannot just dump pool water anywhere. Consider local storm drains or your own property. Avoid flooding your yard or your neighbor's property. Chlorine and other chemicals can harm plants. Direct the water to an area that can absorb it without damage.

### Safety Gear and Monitoring Tools

Safety comes first when working with water and electricity. Always wear closed-toe shoes to protect your feet. Gloves can protect your hands. Use a GFCI outlet for your pump. This device shuts off power if it detects an electrical fault.

You also need a way to monitor the water level. A simple measuring stick or even marking the pool wall helps. This ensures you drain to the exact level needed. It prevents draining too much or too little.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Draining Via the Main Drain (If Applicable)

Some inground pools have a main drain that connects to the pool's filter system. This allows you to drain water through your existing equipment. It is a convenient method if your system supports it. I use this method when I can.

This process involves adjusting your pool's multi-port valve. You will direct water away from the filter and to a waste line. Always ensure your waste line is clear.

### Preparing Your Filter System

Before you start, turn off your pool pump. You do not want the pump running dry. Locate your pool's multi-port valve on the filter. This valve has different settings. Common settings include "Filter," "Backwash," "Rinse," "Recirculate," and "Waste" (or "Drain").

Your goal is to move the handle to the "Waste" setting. This routes water directly out of the pool and to your waste line. If your filter is a sand filter, this is a common method. For more information, you can check out this guide on [how to drain a pool with a sand filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-drain-a-pool-with-a-sand-filter). Ensure all other valves are set correctly to allow water flow from the main drain.

### Activating the Waste Function

Once your multi-port valve is on "Waste," you can turn on your pool pump. The pump will draw water from the main drain at the bottom of your pool. It will then push this water out through the waste line. You should see water flowing out quickly.

Keep an eye on the water level in your pool. It will start to drop. Make sure the water is going where you planned. Avoid flooding areas that cannot handle the water.

### Monitoring and Shut-off

As the water level drops, monitor it closely. Your goal is to drain the water below the skimmer opening. Once the water clears the bottom of the skimmer, turn off your pool pump immediately. Running the pump dry can cause serious damage.

If your pool has multiple skimmers, ensure the water level is below all of them. This method works well for general draining. However, it cannot remove the last few inches of water. You might need a submersible pump for that. You can also learn about [how to blow out main drain inground pool](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-blow-out-main-drain-inground-pool) for winterizing.

## Mastering the Submersible Pump Method for Precise Draining

When draining to a precise level, especially below the skimmer, a submersible pump is often your best friend. This method gives you more control. It also works for pools without a main drain connection to the waste line. I find it very reliable.

This section details how to use a submersible pump safely and effectively. You will learn to manage the water discharge and monitor the draining process. This ensures you hit your target water level perfectly.

### Positioning the Pump Correctly

Place the submersible pump directly into the pool water. Position it on a stable surface at the bottom of the pool. Do not place it directly on the liner if you have one, as sharp edges could damage it. You can use a small plastic milk crate or a paver stone under the pump. This keeps the pump off the very bottom and prevents it from sucking up debris.

Attach your discharge hose firmly to the pump's outlet. Ensure the hose extends far enough away from the pool. You want the water to flow to your designated discharge area without pooling near the pool's edge.

### Managing the Discharge Water

The water coming out of your pump can be significant. Plan your discharge route carefully. Direct the hose to a storm drain, a sewer clean-out, or an area of your yard that can absorb a large amount of water. Remember, pool water contains chemicals like chlorine. These chemicals can harm plants and grass in large concentrations.

If discharging to a public sewer, check local regulations first. Some areas require you to dechlorinate the water before disposal. Always ensure the water flows away from your house foundation or your neighbors' properties.

### Monitoring the Water Level and Skimmer Line

Plug in the submersible pump to a GFCI-protected outlet. The pump will start working immediately. Keep a close watch on the water level. As the water drops, you will see the skimmer opening appear. Continue draining until the water level is well below the lowest point of the skimmer. For winterization, this means below the skimmer throat.

Once the water hits your desired level, unplug the pump. Never let a submersible pump run dry for long periods. This can cause the motor to overheat and fail. Lift the pump out of the pool carefully. There will still be some water in the hose. Let it drain out before storing the pump. You can then proceed with cleaning, such as learning [how to clean the bottom of a pool](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bottom-of-a-pool).

## Critical Considerations Before Draining an Inground Pool

Draining an inground pool, especially below the skimmer, is a big task. It requires more than just moving water. You must think about your pool's construction. You also need to consider the surrounding environment. Skipping these checks can lead to serious damage. I always stress these points to pool owners.

This section covers vital precautions. These steps protect your pool's structure and your property. Always confirm these points before you start any draining work.

### Understanding Your Pool's Construction and Liner

The type of inground pool you have matters a lot. Fiberglass and concrete pools are generally more robust. They can handle draining without major issues. However, vinyl liner pools are different. Draining them completely can cause the liner to float or shift. This happens if groundwater pressure pushes against the empty pool shell. It can create wrinkles or tears when the pool refills.

For vinyl liner pools, draining below the skimmer is usually safe. Draining *completely* is risky and often not advised. If you must drain a vinyl liner pool fully, consult a professional. They can assess groundwater levels and provide specific advice.

### Weather Conditions and Groundwater Levels

Always check the weather forecast. You do not want to drain your pool right before heavy rain. Rain can quickly refill your pool, defeating your draining efforts. It can also increase groundwater pressure around your empty pool shell. This raises the risk of damage, especially for vinyl liner pools.

High groundwater levels are a significant concern. If the water table is high, the pressure from underground water can literally lift an empty pool out of the ground. This is called "floating." It can cause irreversible damage to the pool structure. If you suspect high groundwater, it's best to consult a local pool professional. They have ways to check the water table.

### Local Regulations for Water Disposal

Pool water often contains chemicals like chlorine or salt. Discharging this water directly into storm drains, natural waterways, or even your garden can violate local laws. These chemicals can harm aquatic life and plant life. They can also overwhelm local wastewater treatment systems.

Before you drain, contact your local municipality or water authority. Ask about specific regulations for pool water disposal. They might require you to dechlorinate the water first. They might also suggest specific disposal points, like a sanitary sewer clean-out. Always follow these rules. Ignoring them can result in fines or environmental harm.

## Post-Draining Procedures: Protecting Your Inground Pool

Once your inground pool is drained below the skimmer, your work is not done. This lowered water level opens up new tasks. You must protect the exposed parts of your pool. This is crucial, especially if you are winterizing. I always ensure these steps are done carefully.

This section details the next steps. These actions secure your pool for the season or prepare it for repairs. Proper follow-up ensures your pool stays healthy.

### Winterizing Lines and Equipment

If you drained your pool for winter, protecting the plumbing lines is vital. Water left in pipes can freeze and burst. Use a powerful shop vac or an air compressor to blow out all water from the skimmer lines, return lines, and main drain lines. You want to make sure these lines are completely dry. Start from the closest point to the pool and work your way back to the equipment pad. This prevents costly repairs in the spring.

After blowing out lines, plug them with winterizing plugs. This prevents water from re-entering. Remove all removable equipment like skimmer baskets. Store them in a dry place. You might also need to troubleshoot your skimmer, check [Betta pool skimmer troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/betta-pool-skimmer-troubleshooting).

### Cleaning and Repairing Surfaces

With the water level lowered, you have access to parts of your pool walls and the skimmer opening. This is a good time for deep cleaning. Use a brush and a pool-safe cleaner to scrub away any waterline stains or algae. This helps keep your pool looking good. You can read about [how to clean pool walls](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pool-walls) for more detail.

Inspect the exposed parts of your pool. Look for cracks, leaks, or loose tiles. This is the ideal time to make repairs. Address any issues before refilling the pool. Fixing small problems now prevents them from becoming big ones later.

### Protecting the Pool Structure

After draining, your pool structure needs protection. If you live in an area with freezing temperatures, consider using a winter cover. A solid cover protects the pool from debris. It also helps prevent unwanted refilling from rain or snow. Secure the cover tightly to prevent wind damage.

For long-term draining, like for a major repair, consider temporary bracing for the walls if recommended for your pool type. This is more common for older or weaker structures. Always consult a pool professional if you are unsure about your pool's specific needs. Proper care after draining keeps your pool strong for many years.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues During Pool Draining

Even with careful planning, things can go wrong during pool draining. Pumps might act up. Water might not drain as fast as you expect. Knowing how to handle these issues saves time and stress. I have encountered many of these problems myself.

This section covers common problems you might face. It provides simple solutions. Being prepared helps you complete the draining task smoothly.

### Slow Draining or Clogs

If your pool drains very slowly, or stops draining altogether, check for clogs.
If using the main drain method:
*   **Check the skimmer baskets and pump strainer basket.** These can get full of debris and restrict water flow. Clean them out.
*   **Inspect your multi-port valve.** Make sure it is fully seated on the "Waste" setting. Sometimes it gets stuck between settings.
*   **Consider a clog in the main drain line.** This is less common but possible. If you suspect a major clog, you might need professional help or try to backwash your main drain.

If using a submersible pump:
*   **Check the pump's intake.** Debris like leaves or toys can block the pump's opening. Turn off the pump, remove it, and clear any blockages.
*   **Inspect the discharge hose.** Kinks or twists in the hose can restrict flow. Straighten the hose.
*   **Ensure the discharge area is not flooded.** If the hose outlet is submerged in water, the pump has to work harder, reducing efficiency.

### Pump Malfunctions

Your pump might stop working or make strange noises.
If using your pool's main pump for draining:
*   **Check power supply.** Ensure the pump is plugged in and the circuit breaker is not tripped.
*   **Listen for unusual noises.** If the pump sounds like it is straining or humming without moving water, it might be air-locked. Turn off the pump, check water levels in the pump basket, and restart.
*   **Overheating.** If the pump runs for a long time without sufficient water, it can overheat. Let it cool down before restarting.

If using a submersible pump:
*   **Check power and GFCI.** Ensure the pump is properly plugged into a GFCI outlet and the GFCI has not tripped.
*   **Pump running dry.** Many submersible pumps are not designed to run dry. If the water level drops too low, the pump might stop or be damaged. Turn it off immediately if this happens.
*   **Debris in impeller.** Small stones or debris can get stuck in the pump's impeller. Unplug the pump and carefully inspect the impeller for blockages.

### Uneven Drainage and Structural Concerns

Sometimes, the water might drain unevenly. Or you might notice unsettling cracks.
*   **Uneven Draining:** This is usually not a problem if you are just draining below the skimmer. However, if the ground under your pool shifts significantly, it could indicate a larger issue. For most situations, just keep pumping until the lowest skimmer opening is clear.
*   **Cracks or Liner Shifts:** If you notice new cracks in a concrete pool or shifting/floating of a vinyl liner, stop draining immediately. This indicates a serious structural issue, often related to high groundwater pressure. You should contact a pool professional right away. They can assess the situation and advise on safe repair or refilling. Never ignore these signs, as they can lead to very costly damage.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why must I drain below the skimmer for winter?
Draining below the skimmer prevents water from freezing inside the skimmer opening and its connected pipes. Frozen water expands, causing cracks and costly damage to the skimmer body and plumbing lines. This step protects your pool's essential components from ice-related structural damage during cold months.

### Can I fully drain my inground pool?
It depends on your pool type. Vinyl liner pools should generally not be fully drained, as groundwater pressure can cause the liner to float or shift. Concrete and fiberglass pools are more robust but still carry risks of structural stress or floating if groundwater levels are high. Always consult a professional or local guidelines before full draining.

### How long does it take to drain a pool below the skimmer?
The time depends on your pool's size and your pump's power. A typical residential inground pool might take 4-8 hours to drain from its normal level to below the skimmer. Larger pools or smaller pumps will take longer. Using a powerful submersible pump speeds up the process significantly.

### What kind of submersible pump should I use?
Choose a submersible pump designed for pool or utility use. Look for one with a high flow rate, ideally 2,000-4,000 gallons per hour (GPH). It should have a sturdy base and a connection for a standard discharge hose (1.5-2 inches). Ensure it has an adequate power cord length and always use it with a GFCI outlet for safety.

### What happens if I don't drain properly?
Improper draining can lead to severe damage. If water freezes in pipes, it can burst them. If a vinyl liner pool is drained too much in high groundwater, the liner can float, creating wrinkles or tears. Improper water disposal can violate local laws and harm the environment. Correct draining prevents these costly issues.

### Where can I dispose of pool water?
Check your local municipal regulations first. Many areas allow discharge into a sanitary sewer clean-out or a storm drain, but you might need to dechlorinate the water beforehand. You can also direct it to a permeable area of your yard that can absorb large amounts, ensuring it flows away from your home's foundation and your neighbors' properties.
