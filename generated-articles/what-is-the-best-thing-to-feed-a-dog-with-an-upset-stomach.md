## Feeding a Dog with Upset Stomach: What's Best?

Every dog owner eventually faces the worry of a beloved pet with an upset stomach. You see your dog feeling unwell, and your immediate thought is, "What Is The Best Thing To Feed A Dog With An Upset Stomach?" This common problem can range from mild discomfort to more serious illness. Knowing the right approach to feeding is essential for your dog's speedy recovery. I understand this concern because I have experienced it with my own pets.

This article will guide you through the best foods for a dog with an upset stomach. We will explore bland diet options, the importance of hydration, and foods to strictly avoid. You will also learn when to consider professional veterinary care. My goal is to equip you with the knowledge to help your furry friend feel better.

### Takeaway

When your dog has an upset stomach, here are the key actions:

*   **Offer a Bland Diet:** Stick to easily digestible foods like boiled chicken and plain white rice.
*   **Ensure Hydration:** Provide constant access to fresh water. Offer ice cubes or low-sodium broth if needed.
*   **Avoid Harmful Foods:** Keep your dog away from fatty, spicy, or human foods.
*   **Monitor Symptoms:** Watch for signs of dehydration, prolonged vomiting, or severe diarrhea.
*   **Consult Your Vet:** Seek professional help if symptoms worsen or persist for more than 24-48 hours.

The best thing to feed a dog with an upset stomach is a simple, bland diet. This usually consists of plain, boiled white rice mixed with small amounts of boiled, boneless, skinless chicken breast. This combination is easy to digest, low in fat, and provides gentle nourishment, allowing your dog's digestive system to rest and recover. Always ensure fresh water is available.

### Recognizing a Dog's Upset Stomach: Early Warning Signs

Spotting the signs of a dog's upset stomach early helps you act quickly. Dogs cannot tell us when they feel unwell. We must observe their behavior closely. Common signs include vomiting, diarrhea, or a combination of both. You might see your dog licking their lips excessively, indicating nausea.

Another sign is a decreased appetite or refusal to eat. Your dog may seem lethargic, sleeping more than usual. They might have a hunched posture, suggesting abdominal pain. Sometimes, you may hear gurgling sounds from their stomach, which is also a common indicator.

My own dog once started pacing nervously and drooling. These were new behaviors for her, and they signaled something was wrong. Shortly after, she vomited. Learning to recognize these subtle cues is important for any pet owner.

Observing the nature of the vomit or diarrhea can also provide clues. Is it watery? Does it contain undigested food? Is there any blood present? These details are important to note if you need to contact your veterinarian. Keeping track of the frequency and severity of symptoms helps you provide clear information to your vet.

### Immediate Actions: What to Do First for an Upset Dog

When your dog shows signs of an upset stomach, your first step is usually to withhold food. This allows their digestive system to rest. For mild cases, withholding food for 12-24 hours can be beneficial. Always ensure your dog has access to fresh water during this time.

Hydration is very important when a dog has an upset stomach. Vomiting and diarrhea can quickly lead to dehydration. Offer small amounts of water frequently. You can also try offering ice chips. Some dogs prefer to lick ice rather than drink large amounts of water.

Monitor your dog closely during this initial fasting period. If vomiting continues or becomes severe, fasting may not be appropriate. Call your vet if your dog cannot keep water down. They might need fluids administered by a professional.

My vet once advised me to offer my dog small sips of low-sodium chicken broth. This provided some electrolytes and encouraged her to drink. It is crucial to use only low-sodium options to avoid further upset. Always ensure any broth is plain and does not contain onions or garlic, which are toxic to dogs.

### The Gold Standard: Best Bland Diet Options for Dogs

A bland diet is the cornerstone of recovery for a dog with an upset stomach. These foods are easy to digest. They provide necessary nutrients without irritating the sensitive digestive system. The goal is to give the stomach and intestines a break.

Start by offering very small portions. Give one or two tablespoons every few hours. This prevents overloading the stomach. Gradually increase the amount as your dog tolerates it.

If your dog keeps down the bland food, you can increase the portion size slowly. Do this over the next 24-48 hours. Always observe your dog's reaction to each meal. If vomiting or diarrhea returns, reduce the portion or re-fast for a short period.

#### Boiled Chicken and White Rice: A Classic Choice

Boiled chicken and white rice are the most recommended bland diet for dogs. This combination is simple and effective. Chicken provides lean protein, which is easy to digest. White rice is low in fiber and acts as a binder.

To prepare, boil boneless, skinless chicken breast until fully cooked. Do not add any seasonings, oils, or butter. Shred the chicken into very small pieces. Cook plain white rice according to package directions. Again, use no seasonings or fats.

Mix one part shredded chicken with two parts cooked white rice. Make sure the chicken is completely cooled before serving. My dog always seems to enjoy this bland meal. It is gentle on her stomach and provides needed energy.

This diet helps soothe the digestive tract. It offers a nutrient boost without causing further irritation. The low fiber content of white rice helps firm up stool. This is very helpful when diarrhea is present.

#### Plain Pumpkin: Fiber and Soothing

Plain canned pumpkin is another excellent addition to a bland diet. It is important to use 100% pure pumpkin puree. Do not use pumpkin pie filling, as it contains sugar and spices harmful to dogs. Pumpkin is rich in soluble fiber.

This soluble fiber helps regulate bowel movements. It can either firm up loose stool or help alleviate constipation. It is also a good source of vitamins and minerals. For an upset stomach, a small amount mixed with rice and chicken can be beneficial.

My vet recommended a tablespoon or two for my medium-sized dog. Introduce it slowly to see how your dog reacts. Pumpkin is known for its soothing properties on the digestive tract. It can help calm an irritated stomach lining.

Always ensure the pumpkin you use is free from additives. The soluble fiber forms a gel-like substance in the digestive tract. This helps slow down digestion and absorbs excess water, which is good for diarrhea.

#### Other Soothing Options: Sweet Potatoes and Low-Fat Cottage Cheese

Plain, boiled sweet potatoes can also be part of a bland diet. Like pumpkin, they are a good source of fiber and vitamins. Peel and boil the sweet potato until very soft. Mash it thoroughly, and serve in small amounts. Do not add any seasonings.

Sweet potatoes are gentle on the digestive system. They provide complex carbohydrates for energy. They are also easily digestible, similar to white rice. These vegetables offer different nutrients from rice, providing a bit more variety.

Low-fat cottage cheese can be offered in very small amounts. It provides protein and calcium. However, some dogs are lactose intolerant. Introduce it cautiously to ensure your dog tolerates it well. Start with a teaspoon.

If your dog shows no signs of increased stomach upset, you can continue with small portions. Always choose low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese. High-fat dairy products can worsen an upset stomach. Monitor your dog closely after offering any new food item.

### Ensuring Hydration: Preventing Dehydration in Sick Dogs

Maintaining proper hydration is crucial for a dog with an upset stomach. Vomiting and diarrhea cause rapid fluid loss. This can lead to dehydration, a serious condition. Dehydration can worsen your dog's overall health quickly.

Always have fresh, clean water available for your dog. Offer water in small, frequent amounts. Large gulps of water can sometimes trigger more vomiting. You can try offering ice cubes for your dog to lick. Many dogs find ice cubes appealing and easier to keep down.

Low-sodium chicken or beef broth can encourage fluid intake. Ensure the broth contains no onions, garlic, or other harmful ingredients. These ingredients are toxic to dogs. Warmed broth can be very comforting for a sick dog.

My vet once suggested adding a tiny bit of unflavored Pedialyte to water. This helps replace electrolytes lost during vomiting or diarrhea. However, this should only be done under veterinary guidance. Too much can cause an imbalance.

Monitor your dog for signs of dehydration. These include lethargy, dry gums, sunken eyes, and loss of skin elasticity. To check skin elasticity, gently pull up the skin on your dog's back. If it snaps back slowly, your dog might be dehydrated. Contact your vet immediately if you suspect dehydration.

### Foods to Avoid: Aggravating an Upset Canine Stomach

Knowing what not to feed your dog is just as important as knowing what to offer. Certain foods can worsen an upset stomach. They can prolong recovery or even cause new health problems. Avoiding these items helps prevent further irritation.

Never offer fatty foods. These include bacon, sausages, or greasy table scraps. High-fat foods are difficult for a dog's digestive system to process. They can trigger pancreatitis, a serious and painful inflammation of the pancreas. Pancreatitis requires immediate veterinary attention.

Spicy foods or heavily seasoned foods are also a strict no-go. These can irritate the stomach lining. They can cause more vomiting or diarrhea. Always stick to plain, unseasoned ingredients when preparing a bland diet.

Dairy products like milk, cheese (other than small amounts of low-fat cottage cheese), and yogurt can be problematic. Many dogs are lactose intolerant. This means they lack the enzyme to digest milk sugars. Feeding them dairy can lead to gas, bloating, and diarrhea.

Avoid giving your dog rich commercial kibble. Regular dog food can be too complex for an upset digestive system. The fats, proteins, and fibers can be hard to process. Stick to the bland diet until your dog recovers. Gradually reintroduce their regular food later.

Do not give your dog human medications without vet approval. Many over-the-counter drugs are toxic to dogs. Some common pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can cause severe organ damage in dogs. Always consult your veterinarian before administering any medication.

### Gradual Recovery: Reintroducing Regular Dog Food

After your dog's upset stomach symptoms subside, you cannot immediately switch back to their regular food. A sudden change can trigger a relapse. The key is to reintroduce their normal diet gradually. This allows their digestive system to readjust slowly.

Start by mixing a small amount of your dog's regular kibble with the bland diet. Begin with a ratio of about 25% kibble to 75% bland food. Feed this mixture for one to two days. Observe your dog closely for any returning symptoms.

If your dog tolerates this mixture well, gradually increase the proportion of kibble. Move to 50% kibble and 50% bland food for another day or two. Continue this process, increasing the kibble by 25% increments every 1-2 days. The goal is a full transition over 5-7 days.

During this transition, continue to monitor your dog's stool and behavior. If you notice any signs of upset, such as vomiting or loose stools, revert to the previous step. You may need to slow down the reintroduction process further. Patience is key to preventing a setback.

My own experience taught me the importance of this slow transition. Rushing the process led to my dog's symptoms returning. A slow and steady approach ensures your dog's digestive system fully recovers. It also helps them adapt to their normal diet again.

Remember to keep fresh water available at all times. Hydration remains important throughout the recovery process. A slow and mindful reintroduction helps secure a full and lasting recovery for your dog.

### When to Worry: Recognizing Serious Symptoms and Vet Care

While many cases of upset stomach are mild, some require immediate veterinary attention. Knowing when to call your vet is critical. Delaying care can lead to serious health complications for your dog. Your dog's well-being depends on your quick action.

Seek veterinary help if your dog's vomiting or diarrhea is severe or prolonged. This means if it lasts for more than 24-48 hours. Frequent vomiting, especially if your dog cannot keep water down, is a red flag. Persistent diarrhea, particularly if it is watery or bloody, also warrants a vet visit.

Observe your dog's energy level. If your dog becomes very lethargic, weak, or unresponsive, call your vet immediately. Signs of severe dehydration, like sunken eyes, very dry gums, or skin that stays tented when pinched, are emergencies. Your dog may need intravenous fluids.

Other serious symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, or difficulty breathing. If your dog is trying to vomit but nothing comes up, this could indicate bloat. Bloat is a life-threatening condition requiring urgent care. Any foreign object ingestion suspicion also needs immediate vet attention.

My dog once had vomiting that lasted over a day. She became very quiet and seemed weak. I called the vet, and they asked me to bring her in. It turned out she had a mild infection. The vet prescribed medication and specific dietary advice. Trust your instincts as a pet parent. If something feels off, it is always best to err on the side of caution and consult a professional.

### Beyond Diet: Probiotics and Digestive Support

After an upset stomach, a dog's gut flora can be imbalanced. Probiotics can help restore beneficial bacteria in the digestive system. These are live microorganisms. They promote a healthy gut environment. A healthy gut is vital for nutrient absorption and overall immunity.

Probiotics can be given as a supplement. They come in various forms, such as powders, capsules, or chews. Choose a probiotic specifically formulated for dogs. Human probiotics may not contain the correct strains of bacteria for canine digestive systems. Always consult your vet before starting any new supplement.

Prebiotics are another form of digestive support. These are non-digestible fibers. They act as food for the beneficial bacteria in the gut. Some bland diet foods, like pumpkin, naturally contain prebiotics. Combining probiotics and prebiotics (a synbiotic approach) can be very effective.

My vet recommended a probiotic supplement after my dog had a severe bout of diarrhea. It seemed to help her recovery. She returned to her normal digestive rhythm faster. Probiotics can also be beneficial during times of stress or antibiotic use. Both can disrupt gut health.

Do not give your dog any human digestive aids without vet approval. Products like Pepto-Bismol or Imodium can be dangerous for dogs. They can contain ingredients toxic to pets or mask serious underlying conditions. Always follow your veterinarian's advice for any medications or supplements.

### Cleaning Up Accidents: Managing Vomit and Diarrhea Messes

An upset stomach often leads to unfortunate accidents around the house. Vomit and diarrhea can stain carpets, furniture, and other surfaces. Prompt cleanup is essential for hygiene and preventing odors. Having the right cleaning supplies ready helps immensely.

When your dog vomits on the carpet, act quickly. First, remove any solid material with a spoon or paper towel. Avoid rubbing the vomit, as this can push it deeper into the fibers. Then, blot the area with a clean cloth to absorb as much moisture as possible.

Enzyme cleaners are excellent for breaking down organic matter and neutralizing odors.

If your dog has diarrhea on hard surfaces like concrete, clean it thoroughly. Remove solids, then scrub the area with a stiff brush and a cleaning solution. A mixture of warm water and a small amount of dish soap can work. Rinse well afterward.

Stepping in dog poop is an unpleasant experience. It often happens when taking your sick dog outside for frequent potty breaks. If you get dog poop on your shoes, cleaning them promptly prevents tracking it indoors. Scrape off the excess, then use soap and water or a specialized shoe cleaner.
