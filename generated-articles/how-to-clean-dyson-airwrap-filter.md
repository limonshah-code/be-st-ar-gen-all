## Unlock Peak Performance: How to Clean Your Dyson Airwrap Filter

My Dyson Airwrap is one of my favorite styling tools. It delivers beautiful curls and waves with minimal heat damage. Many people own a Dyson Airwrap, but they often forget one crucial step: cleaning its filter. A clean filter ensures your Airwrap works at its best. It also helps your device last longer. I am here to guide you through the simple steps to clean your Dyson Airwrap filter. This guide covers everything from recognizing when it needs cleaning to the proper tools and techniques. You will learn how to maintain your Airwrap's powerful airflow. This ensures you get salon-quality results every time you style your hair. Keeping the filter clean is simple. It makes a big difference in your Airwrap's performance and lifespan.

### Takeaway: Simple Steps to Maintain Your Airwrap

*   Clean your Dyson Airwrap filter regularly for peak performance.
*   Use the filter cleaning brush and a damp cloth for best results.
*   Allow the filter cage to dry completely before reattaching it.
*   Proper maintenance prevents power loss and device damage.

Cleaning your Dyson Airwrap filter involves a few simple steps. First, remove the filter cage. Then, use the provided cleaning brush to clear debris. Finally, wipe the cage with a damp cloth and let it dry fully. This process restores airflow and maintains your Airwrap's power.

## The Importance of a Clean Dyson Airwrap Filter

My Dyson Airwrap creates stunning hairstyles. It works by using a powerful motor to generate a high-velocity airflow. This airflow creates the Coanda effect, which styles hair with air, not extreme heat. The Airwrap draws air into its motor through a small filter located at the base of the handle. This filter traps dust, lint, hairspray residue, and other debris from the air.

Over time, this debris builds up on the filter. A clogged filter restricts airflow to the motor. When airflow is restricted, the motor works harder. This extra effort can reduce the device's performance. It might even cause the Airwrap to overheat or shut down during use. Think of it like a car engine; a dirty air filter reduces fuel efficiency and power. Similarly, a dirty Dyson Airwrap filter diminishes its styling effectiveness. It can even shorten the life of your valuable device.

Maintaining a clean filter ensures your Airwrap provides consistent, powerful airflow. This means the Coanda effect works properly. Your curls will hold better, and drying will be faster. I have seen firsthand the difference a clean filter makes. My styling results are always better. A clean filter also protects the internal components of your Airwrap from dust and hair. This protection is key to the device's longevity. It keeps your investment safe and functioning correctly for many years. Regular filter cleaning is a simple act. It gives you a great return on your styling investment.

## Recognizing When Your Airwrap Filter Needs Cleaning

How do you know it's time to clean your Dyson Airwrap filter? Your Airwrap will often give you clear signs. The most common sign is a noticeable decrease in airflow or styling power. You might find your hair takes longer to dry. Or, your curls might not form as easily or hold their shape as well. This happens because the clogged filter prevents the motor from getting enough air. The Coanda effect then weakens.

Another sign is if the device repeatedly pulses or shuts off during use. The Dyson Airwrap has a safety mechanism. If the motor overheats due to restricted airflow, it will automatically shut down. This prevents damage. If your Airwrap stops mid-styling, a dirty filter is likely the cause. You might also hear a change in the motor's sound. It could sound strained or louder than usual. This indicates it is working harder to pull air through the clogged filter. I always listen for these subtle changes. They tell me it is time for a quick cleaning session.

You can also visually inspect the filter. The filter cage is at the bottom of the handle. Hold your Airwrap up to a light source. Look closely at the mesh. You will see accumulated dust, lint, and hair. If the mesh appears significantly covered, it needs cleaning. Dyson recommends cleaning the filter at least once a month. However, I clean mine more often. I use my Airwrap almost daily. If you use hairspray or styling products heavily, your filter might get dirty faster. Regular visual checks are important. They help you decide when a cleaning is due.

## Gathering Your Tools: What You Need for Filter Cleaning

Cleaning your Dyson Airwrap filter is straightforward. You only need a few basic tools. Dyson provides a specific filter cleaning brush with every Airwrap. This brush is essential. It has stiff bristles designed to dislodge stubborn dust and hair from the filter mesh. If you cannot find your original brush, you can use a clean, soft-bristled toothbrush. Make sure the toothbrush is dry and dedicated only to cleaning the filter. Avoid using metal brushes or anything too abrasive. These can damage the delicate mesh of the filter.

Next, you will need a lint-free cloth or microfibre towel. This is for wiping down the filter cage after brushing. A damp cloth helps remove fine dust particles. It can also clear any residue that brushing alone cannot remove. Ensure the cloth is only slightly damp, not wet. Excess water can damage the electrical components of your Airwrap if it gets inside. I usually wring out my cloth very well before using it.

Finally, you might need a small basin or sink with cool water for a deeper clean of the filter cage. This is only if your filter is very dirty. I will explain this process later. For routine cleaning, the brush and a dry cloth are sufficient. Always remember to unplug your Dyson Airwrap from the power outlet before you begin any cleaning. Safety comes first. Having all your tools ready before starting the process makes the cleaning quick and efficient. This preparation prevents interruptions.

## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Clean Your Dyson Airwrap Filter

Cleaning your Dyson Airwrap filter is a simple process. Follow these steps for an effective clean. This will restore your Airwrap's performance.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Dyson Airwrap

Safety is important. First, ensure your Dyson Airwrap is completely unplugged from the power outlet. Do not try to clean the filter while the device is plugged in. This prevents any accidental activation. It also protects you from electric shock. Allow your Airwrap to cool down completely if you just used it. Hot surfaces can make cleaning uncomfortable. They also might interfere with the material of the filter.

Next, locate the filter cage at the bottom of your Airwrap handle. It is a cylindrical mesh component. You will need to twist it to unlock it. Gently twist the filter cage counter-clockwise. It usually takes a quarter turn. You will feel a slight click. This indicates the filter cage is loose. Once it clicks, pull the cage straight down to remove it from the main body of the Airwrap. Set the main Airwrap unit aside on a clean, dry surface. Now you have the filter cage ready for cleaning.

### Step 2: Initial Dust Removal with the Cleaning Brush

This is the most important part of the cleaning process. Take your Dyson filter cleaning brush. It has stiff, short bristles. Insert the brush into the filter cage. The brush is designed to fit snugly inside. Move the brush back and forth. Rotate it to make sure the bristles contact all parts of the mesh.

The bristles will dislodge hair, dust, and lint trapped in the filter. You will see visible debris coming out. Continue brushing until no more dust or hair comes loose. Be thorough but gentle. Do not press too hard, as this can deform the mesh. The goal is to clear the visible blockages. This step is usually sufficient for routine cleaning. Many Dyson owners also regularly clean their [Dyson blow dryer filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dyson-blow-dryer-filter). The process for these filters is very similar.

### Step 3: Wipe Down the Filter Cage

After brushing, fine dust particles might still cling to the mesh. Take your lint-free cloth. Dampen it slightly with cool water. Wring out all excess water. The cloth should feel just damp, not wet. Wipe the exterior and interior surfaces of the filter cage.

This helps pick up any remaining dust. It also removes residues from hair products that might have accumulated. Pay attention to the fine mesh. Ensure you remove all visible grime. This step ensures maximum airflow once the filter is reassembled. Remember, a clean filter helps your Airwrap perform its best.

### Step 4: Drying the Filter Cage

Drying the filter cage completely is critical. Never reattach a damp or wet filter cage to your Airwrap. Moisture inside the device can cause serious damage to its electrical components. Place the cleaned filter cage on a clean, dry towel. Allow it to air dry for at least 24 hours. I usually leave mine in a well-ventilated area overnight.

Make sure no water droplets remain on the mesh or inside the cage. You can gently shake the cage to dislodge any trapped water. You can also use a dry, lint-free cloth to dab any moisture. Patience is important here. A fully dry filter prevents damage. This ensures your Airwrap operates safely.

### Step 5: Reassemble the Filter

Once the filter cage is completely dry, you can reattach it to your Airwrap. Align the cage with the base of the handle. There are usually small arrows or guides on the filter and the device. These help with proper alignment. Push the filter cage upwards into the handle.

Then, twist it clockwise until you hear a click. This click indicates the filter cage is securely locked in place. Give it a gentle tug to ensure it is firm. Your Dyson Airwrap is now ready to use. You should notice improved airflow immediately. My Airwrap always feels brand new after this cleaning. Many people also clean their Dyson Airwrap attachments.

## Deep Cleaning Your Dyson Airwrap Filter for Stubborn Buildup

Sometimes, routine brushing is not enough. If your Dyson Airwrap filter has stubborn buildup, you might need to deep clean it. This buildup can include sticky hairspray residue or significant lint accumulation. A deep clean helps restore airflow when a simple brush-off doesn't quite do the trick. I usually deep clean my filter a few times a year. This depends on how often I use hair products.

Start by removing the filter cage as described earlier. Then, take a small basin or sink. Fill it with cool water. You can add a tiny drop of mild dish soap to the water. Do not use strong detergents or harsh chemicals. They can damage the filter material. Submerge the filter cage in the soapy water. Let it soak for about 10-15 minutes. This helps loosen stubborn grime and residue.

After soaking, use your filter cleaning brush. Gently scrub the mesh inside and out while it is still submerged. The water helps lift the dirt. You will see the water getting cloudy as debris comes off. Rinse the filter cage thoroughly under cool running water. Make sure all soap residue is gone. Any leftover soap can attract more dust later. Rinse until the water runs clear. Then, follow the drying and reassembly steps carefully. Ensure the filter cage is absolutely dry before placing it back on your Airwrap. This deep cleaning method is effective. It keeps your Airwrap running smoothly.

## Frequency and Best Practices for Airwrap Filter Maintenance

How often should you clean your Dyson Airwrap filter? Dyson recommends cleaning the filter at least once a month. However, your cleaning frequency depends on several factors. If you use your Airwrap daily, or if you use a lot of styling products like hairspray, you should clean it more often. I personally clean mine every two to three weeks. This ensures consistent performance. Hair type also plays a role. If you have long hair or hair that sheds a lot, your filter will accumulate debris faster.

Regular visual inspection is a key best practice. Quickly check the filter before each use. If you see any visible dust or hair, take a moment to brush it off. This prevents major buildup. It saves you from needing a deep clean too often. Think of it like daily upkeep. A quick brush takes only a minute. It prevents bigger problems.

Proper storage also helps. When not in use, store your Airwrap in a clean, dust-free place. The Dyson Airwrap comes with a storage case. Using this case protects the device. It also keeps the filter from collecting airborne dust. Avoid storing it on dusty surfaces or near open windows. This reduces the amount of debris entering the filter. Following these best practices extends your Airwrap's life. It ensures it always performs at its best. Just like how you might maintain other Dyson filters, such as learning [how to clean a Dyson air filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dyson-air-filter) for a purifier, consistent care is vital.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Your Airwrap Filter

While cleaning the Dyson Airwrap filter is simple, it is easy to make mistakes. Avoiding these common errors ensures you clean your device safely and effectively. The first mistake is not unplugging the device. This is a significant safety risk. Always ensure the Airwrap is disconnected from power before you touch the filter. Cleaning a live electrical appliance is dangerous. I always double-check the plug.

Another common mistake is using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials. Bleach, alcohol, or other strong cleaning agents can damage the plastic and mesh of the filter cage. They can also leave residues that attract more dust. Stick to cool water and a very mild soap if needed for deep cleaning. Never use metal brushes, wire brushes, or anything that can scratch or tear the delicate mesh. The Dyson cleaning brush or a soft toothbrush is perfect. Damage to the filter mesh can reduce its effectiveness. This allows debris to enter the motor.

Reassembling a wet filter is also a serious error. Moisture inside the Airwrap can cause short circuits or damage the motor. This can lead to costly repairs or even render your device unusable. Always allow the filter cage to air dry completely for at least 24 hours. Patience here saves you from potential device failure. I sometimes leave mine to dry even longer to be safe.

Finally, neglecting regular cleaning is a mistake. Waiting until the Airwrap loses significant power means the filter is already heavily clogged. This puts strain on the motor. Regular, light cleaning is much better for your device than infrequent, intensive cleanings. A little consistent effort goes a long way.

## Troubleshooting Filter-Related Performance Issues

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter performance issues. If your Dyson Airwrap still feels underpowered after cleaning the filter, check a few things. First, double-check that the filter cage is fully and securely locked in place. If it is loose, air can leak, reducing the Coanda effect. A simple twist and click usually solves this.

Next, consider the condition of the filter itself. Has the mesh become stretched or torn over time? If the filter mesh is damaged, debris can pass through it. This debris can then reach the motor. A damaged filter requires replacement, not just cleaning. You can order replacement parts directly from Dyson. This ensures you get a genuine part.

Sometimes, hair or dust can get past the filter into the main body of the Airwrap. This is rare if the filter is intact. If you suspect this, contact Dyson support. Do not attempt to open the main body of the Airwrap yourself. This could void your warranty. Dyson customer service can provide specific guidance. They can also arrange for professional service if needed.

Finally, think about your power source. Are you using the Airwrap with an appropriate voltage? Is the outlet working correctly? An insufficient power supply can mimic filter issues. This is less common but worth considering. A clean filter solves most performance problems. However, it is good to know what else to check. This ensures your Airwrap always performs its best.
