### Why Clean Your Remington 870 Shotgun? Protecting Your Investment

Your Remington 870 is a precision tool. It functions best when clean. Dirt, carbon, and old lubricants build up inside. This debris causes problems. It can slow down moving parts. It can also lead to failures to feed or eject shells. A dirty shotgun becomes less reliable.

Rust is another major enemy. Moisture and residues invite rust formation. Rust degrades metal surfaces. It weakens parts and makes your shotgun unsafe. Regular cleaning removes these harmful elements. It protects the metal from corrosion. This extends the life of your shotgun.

Accuracy suffers with a dirty barrel. Fouling from gunpowder and wads builds up. This affects the projectile's path. A clean bore ensures consistent shot patterns. This is important for hunting or sport shooting. You hit targets more reliably with a clean gun.

Safety is always first. A well-maintained shotgun works as designed. Malfunctions are dangerous. They can occur if parts stick or fail to move freely. Cleaning ensures all components move smoothly. This helps prevent accidental discharges. A clean gun is a safe gun.

I clean my 870 after every use. This keeps it ready for the next adventure. It also saves time in the long run. Small cleaning sessions are easier than major overhauls. Your investment deserves this care.

### Gathering Your Essential Remington 870 Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin to clean your 870 Remington shotgun, gather all necessary tools. Having everything ready saves time. It makes the cleaning process smooth. You will need specific items for proper firearm care. Do not use household cleaners not meant for guns. These can damage your shotgun.

Start with a dedicated cleaning kit. These kits usually contain most basic items. You will need a cleaning rod. Make sure it is long enough for your barrel. Choose one with a rotating handle. This helps the brush follow the rifling. Different bore brushes are important. Get one for the bore and one for the chamber. A phosphor bronze brush works well for tough carbon. Nylon brushes are gentler for light cleaning.

You also need cleaning patches. Get them in various sizes. Use patches that fit snugly in the bore. A jag or patch holder attaches to the rod. It pushes patches through the barrel. Cleaning solvent is crucial. It breaks down carbon, lead, and plastic fouling. Follow the solvent's instructions. A good gun oil or lubricant is next. It protects parts from rust and reduces friction. Some oils work as a cleaner and lubricant.

Small picks and brushes help with hard-to-reach areas. Cotton swabs are also useful. A soft cloth or old T-shirt is good for wiping parts. Have a well-lit work area. Use a cleaning mat. This protects your table from chemicals. It also catches small parts. Always wear safety glasses. Nitrile gloves protect your hands from chemicals. Good ventilation is also important. These tools make your cleaning job effective. They help you maintain your 870 shotgun.

### Safe Disassembly: Field Stripping Your Remington 870

Disassembling your Remington 870 is the first step in cleaning. This process is called field stripping. It allows you to access internal parts. Always prioritize safety. Make sure your shotgun is unloaded. Check the chamber and magazine tube visually and by feel. Point the gun in a safe direction.

#### Removing the Barrel

First, clear the action. Rack the slide multiple times. Check the chamber. Check the magazine tube. Ensure no shells are present. Point the muzzle in a safe direction. Next, unscrew the magazine cap. This cap holds the barrel in place. Some models have a dimple that prevents easy removal of the magazine cap, you may need to consult your owner's manual for specific instructions. Pull the barrel forward and off the receiver. It should slide out easily. Set the barrel aside on your cleaning mat.

#### Removing the Trigger Group

The trigger group is next. Push out the two retaining pins. These pins hold the trigger group in the receiver. Use a punch or a sturdy tool like the end of your cleaning rod. Push them from right to left. Be careful not to lose the pins. They are small. Once the pins are out, pull the trigger group down and out. It might require a little wiggle. This part contains the trigger, hammer, and other firing components.

#### Removing the Fore-end and Bolt Carrier

Now, pull the fore-end forward slightly. The bolt and carrier assembly will come with it. You can then separate the bolt assembly from the fore-end. The bolt assembly usually slides off the fore-end tubes. Be gentle with these parts. They are important for the shotgun's function. This level of disassembly is enough for routine cleaning. Do not take apart the trigger group unless you are an expert. You can damage the small springs and pins inside. Detailed instructions are in your shotgun's manual.

### Detailed Cleaning of the Shotgun Barrel and Receiver

Now that your Remington 870 is field stripped, you can start cleaning. The barrel and receiver are main areas. They collect the most fouling. Proper cleaning here impacts performance and safety. I focus on these areas heavily.

Start with the barrel. Secure it upright if possible. Take your cleaning rod with a bore brush. Apply cleaning solvent to the brush. Push the brush through the barrel from the chamber end. Push it all the way out. Do not pull it back through the bore if possible. This can drag debris back into the bore. Remove the brush when it exits the muzzle. Then, pull the rod back. Repeat this 3-5 times. The brush scrubs away carbon and plastic fouling. Some shooters prefer to pull the brush back through, but pushing through completely is often gentler on the crown.

Next, attach a patch jag to the rod. Put a patch soaked with solvent on the jag. Push it through the barrel. Repeat with fresh patches until they come out clean. This removes loosened debris. Then, use dry patches to dry the bore. Inspect the bore with a bore light. Look for any remaining fouling. If you see streaks, repeat the solvent and patching steps. Copper fouling can also build up, which might require a specialized copper solvent for removal, similar to how one might clean copper components elsewhere. You can find more information on handling copper here: [how to clean copper](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-copper).

Move to the receiver. This is where the barrel connects. It also houses the bolt. Use a soft brush or a nylon brush. Apply solvent lightly to the brush. Scrub inside the receiver. Pay attention to the areas where the bolt rides. Also clean around the ejector and shell lifter. Carbon and unburnt powder gather here. Use cotton swabs for tight spots. Wipe all surfaces clean with a dry cloth. Ensure no solvent residue remains. A clean receiver allows smooth cycling. It prevents jams. Proper cleaning here means your 870 runs flawlessly.

### Cleaning Bolt, Trigger Group, and Other Components

After cleaning the barrel and receiver, move to the smaller parts. The bolt, trigger group, and fore-end assembly need attention. These parts are critical for your shotgun's function. They also collect a lot of grime. Being careful here prevents future issues.

Start with the bolt assembly. This part cycles shells. It gets very dirty. Use a nylon brush and solvent. Scrub all surfaces of the bolt and bolt carrier. Pay close attention to the bolt face. This area contacts the shell primer. Carbon builds up here quickly. Use picks or cotton swabs for small crevices. Clean the extractor and ejector. These parts grab and throw out spent shells. Make sure they move freely. Wipe all surfaces dry with a clean cloth.

The trigger group is next. This component contains many small springs and pins. Do not disassemble it further unless you are trained. Instead, use a spray cleaner designed for firearms. This can flush out grime from inside the group. Spray it into all openings. Let it drain. Use a soft brush to clean visible dirt. Use compressed air to blow out excess cleaner and loosened debris. Then, use cotton swabs to wipe down reachable surfaces. Be gentle. This is a delicate part. Precision cleaning, similar to working on a carburetor, is helpful here to ensure all small components are free of residue. You can find general principles for cleaning intricate mechanical parts here: [how to clean carburetor](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-carburetor).

Clean the fore-end assembly. This includes the slide bars. These bars allow the pump action to move. Wipe them down with solvent on a cloth. Remove any old grease or dirt. Ensure they are smooth. Clean the magazine tube as well. Wipe the inside and outside. Use a patch or brush on a rod for the inside. This tube feeds shells into the chamber. Any obstruction affects feeding. Clean any choke tubes separately. Use a specialized choke brush and solvent. Remove carbon and plastic buildup. This ensures correct shot patterns. All these small parts contribute to your 870's overall performance.

### Proper Lubrication and Reassembly of Your 870

Once all parts are clean, lubrication is next. Lubrication reduces friction. It prevents wear. It also protects metal surfaces from rust. Use a good quality gun oil or lubricant. Do not over-lubricate. Too much oil attracts dirt. This can lead to new problems. Apply a thin, even coat.

Apply a light coat of oil to the barrel's exterior. Use a patch with a small amount of oil. Push an oiled patch through the bore one last time. This protects the bore from rust. Pay attention to the exterior metal parts of the barrel. The receiver needs lubrication where parts slide. Put a thin film of oil on the interior rails. These are where the bolt carrier moves. Also oil the shell lifter and ejector. A drop of oil on their pivot points helps.

Lubricate the bolt assembly. Apply a light coat of oil to the bolt body. Pay attention to the locking lugs. These engage the barrel extension. Put a small drop on the extractor and ejector pins. Wipe down the slide bars of the fore-end. A thin layer of oil on these ensures smooth pump action. If you removed the choke tube, apply a thin layer of grease to its threads. This prevents it from seizing.

Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly.
1.  **Attach the bolt and fore-end:** Slide the bolt assembly onto the fore-end tubes.
2.  **Insert the fore-end and bolt:** Slide the fore-end assembly into the receiver. Ensure the bolt aligns correctly.
3.  **Insert the trigger group:** Guide the trigger group into the receiver. Push the two retaining pins back into place from left to right. They should click securely.
4.  **Attach the barrel:** Slide the barrel into the receiver. Make sure it seats fully.
5.  **Screw on the magazine cap:** Tighten the magazine cap firmly. This secures the barrel.

After reassembly, perform a function check. Point the shotgun in a safe direction. Cycle the action several times. Feel for smooth operation. Press the trigger (on an empty chamber). Ensure the hammer drops. This confirms your 870 is ready for use. Proper lubrication makes your shotgun run like new.

### Post-Cleaning Care and Long-Term Remington 870 Storage

Cleaning your Remington 870 is a vital part of its care. But maintenance does not stop there. Proper storage is just as important. It protects your shotgun between uses. It ensures your firearm stays in top condition for years. Consistent care extends its lifespan.

After every cleaning session, perform a quick visual inspection. Look for any loose screws or pins. Check for unusual wear patterns. Catching small issues early prevents big problems. Wipe down the exterior of your shotgun with an oiled cloth. This removes fingerprints and adds a layer of protection. It helps prevent rust from forming on exposed metal. Use a silicone cloth for this.

Consider the frequency of cleaning. Clean your 870 after every shooting session. This is important even if you fire only a few rounds. Residue from gunpowder and primers is corrosive. It starts causing damage quickly. If you shoot many rounds, a thorough cleaning is essential. For long-term storage, a detailed cleaning is a must. You want the gun to be perfectly clean and well-oiled.

Choose a good storage location. A climate-controlled environment is best. Avoid damp basements or hot attics. These conditions promote rust and material degradation. A gun safe is ideal. It protects your firearm from theft and unauthorized access. It also offers some environmental protection. Many safes are dehumidified. This keeps moisture away from your shotgun.

If storing for an extended period (months or years), apply a heavier coat of preservative oil. Consider using a gun sock. These are fabric sleeves often treated with rust inhibitors. They provide an extra layer of protection. Do not store your shotgun in a soft case for long periods. Soft cases can trap moisture. This leads to rust. Always store your 870 unloaded. Keep ammunition separate. This is a critical safety rule. Regular maintenance and proper storage keep your Remington 870 ready.
