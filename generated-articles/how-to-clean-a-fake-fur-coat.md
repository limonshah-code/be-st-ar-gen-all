To clean a fake fur coat, first check its care label for specific instructions. Most faux fur coats can be hand-washed or spot-cleaned with mild detergent and cold water. Always air dry the coat away from heat. Gentle handling prevents damage to the fibers, keeping your coat soft and plush.

## Understanding Your Faux Fur: Why Proper Care Matters

Fake fur, also known as faux fur, consists of synthetic fibers. These fibers often include acrylic, polyester, or blends. Manufacturers design them to look and feel like real animal fur. Because they are synthetic, they react differently to water and heat than real fur. Proper care helps these fibers maintain their shape and texture. It also stops them from becoming matted or damaged.

Real fur needs professional dry cleaning. Fake fur usually does not. Dry cleaning chemicals can harm synthetic fibers. They can make the fur stiff or cause it to lose its softness. Many fake fur coats are washable at home. Checking the care label is the most important first step. The label tells you if you can hand wash, machine wash, or only spot clean. Following these instructions protects your coat. Ignoring them can ruin its look and feel.

If you bought a fake fur coat from a second-hand store, it might not have a care label. In this case, always choose the gentlest cleaning method. Spot testing a small area first is also a smart idea. Learning how to clean a fake fur coat ensures it stays a cherished item in your wardrobe. Remember that gentleness is key. This approach keeps the fur fibers intact and soft.

It provides helpful tips for ensuring delicate materials are cared for properly.

## Pre-Cleaning Steps: Prepare Your Fake Fur Coat

Proper preparation makes the cleaning process easier and more effective. Before you apply any water or cleaner, take time to prepare your fake fur coat. This initial stage helps remove loose dirt and prevents it from spreading. It also lets you check for any specific problem areas.

First, shake your fake fur coat vigorously. Hold it by the shoulders and give it several good shakes. This action dislodges loose dust, crumbs, and other debris. You might be surprised how much dust comes off. Shaking it outdoors is best to avoid spreading dust inside your home. This step prepares the fur for deeper cleaning.

Next, use a soft-bristled brush to gently comb through the fur. A pet brush designed for fine fur works well. Brush in the direction of the fur's pile. This helps untangle any matted sections. It also removes more loose particles that shaking missed. Be gentle; do not pull hard on the fibers. This brushing also helps to lift the fur.

After brushing, inspect your coat for any visible stains. Look for food spills, makeup marks, or dirt spots. Identifying these spots early helps you focus your cleaning efforts. You can then decide if spot cleaning is enough or if the whole coat needs washing. Pay extra attention to cuffs, collars, and pockets. These areas often get dirtier faster.

Always perform a spot test before using any cleaning solution on your coat. Choose an inconspicuous area, like an inside seam or a small part of the lining. Apply a tiny amount of your cleaning solution to this spot. Wait a few minutes and check for any discoloration or damage. If the fabric looks fine, you can proceed with cleaning the rest of the coat. This step prevents potential damage to your coat's color or texture.

When dealing with light-colored coats, especially white ones, stains are more noticeable. Our guide on [how to clean white coat](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-coat) offers further insights into pre-treating and washing light-colored garments effectively, which can be useful here.

## Spot Cleaning Stubborn Stains on Faux Fur

Spot cleaning is perfect for small spills and isolated stains. It avoids the need to wash the entire coat. This method saves time and reduces stress on the fabric. It is also the safest option for faux fur that cannot be fully submerged in water. You will need a few basic supplies for effective spot cleaning.

Start with a clean white cloth or sponge. Avoid colored cloths, as their dye might transfer to your coat. Prepare a mild cleaning solution. Mix a small amount of gentle laundry detergent or dish soap with cool water. Use only a tiny drop of soap; too much can leave residue. You want a very dilute solution, barely sudsy.

Dip your cloth or sponge into the cleaning solution. Wring out excess water thoroughly. The cloth should be damp, not soaking wet. Excessive moisture can damage the faux fur or the coat's lining. You want to apply just enough moisture to clean the stain.

Gently dab the stained area with the damp cloth. Do not rub the stain. Rubbing can push the stain deeper into the fibers. It can also mat or damage the faux fur pile. Use a blotting motion, working from the outside of the stain inwards. This helps prevent the stain from spreading. Repeat this dabbing process until the stain begins to lift.

Once the stain is gone, use a new clean cloth dampened with plain cool water. Dab the area again to rinse away any soap residue. It is important to remove all soap. Leftover soap can attract more dirt over time. Finally, blot the area with a dry towel to absorb as much moisture as possible. Allow the spot-cleaned area to air dry completely. You can gently fluff the fur with your fingers as it dries to restore its texture.

For delicate items that require precise cleaning, such as intricate jewelry pieces, the same gentle approach to spot treatment applies. You can find more tips on careful cleaning techniques in our article about [how to clean fake diamonds](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-fake-diamonds).

## Hand Washing Your Fake Fur Coat for Best Results

Hand washing is often the safest and most recommended method for cleaning fake fur coats. It offers maximum control over the cleaning process. This helps prevent damage to delicate faux fur fibers. If your care label suggests hand washing, this is the method to choose. Even without a label, hand washing is a good choice for unknown or delicate faux fur.

First, gather your supplies. You will need a clean bathtub or a large basin. Ensure it is free of any dirt or residue. You will also need a mild laundry detergent designed for delicates. Woolite or a similar gentle soap works well. Make sure the soap does not contain harsh chemicals or bleaches. These can strip the softness from the faux fur.

Fill the tub or basin with cool water. Cold water is important for faux fur. Hot water can damage the synthetic fibers. It can also cause them to melt or become matted. Add a small amount of your chosen mild detergent to the water. Swirl the water gently to mix the soap. You want a consistent, lightly sudsy solution. Avoid creating too many suds.

Submerge your fake fur coat into the soapy water. Gently press the coat down to ensure it is fully saturated. Do not rub, twist, or wring the coat. Instead, gently agitate the water with your hands. Swish the coat around for a few minutes. Focus on gently squeezing the soapy water through the fur. This action helps release dirt and oils without damaging the fibers. Let the coat soak for about 15-20 minutes.

After soaking, drain the soapy water. Refill the tub with clean, cool water. Rinse the coat thoroughly. Continue to gently squeeze the water through the fur. Repeat this rinsing process several times. Change the water until it runs clear and no soap bubbles remain. Rinsing completely is vital to prevent residue buildup. Once rinsed, gently press out excess water without twisting or wringing. You want to remove as much water as possible before drying.

Applying gentle care techniques is important not just for coats but also for other items with fur-like textures. For insights into cleaning other delicate, fur-adorned accessories, read our guide on [how to clean fur shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-fur-shoes).

## Machine Washing Fake Fur: When It's Safe (and How)

Machine washing a fake fur coat can save time and effort. However, it is only safe if the care label explicitly allows it. Many faux fur items are too delicate for machine washing. Always check the care tag before putting your coat in the washing machine. If the label says "dry clean only" or "hand wash only," do not machine wash it. Ignoring these instructions can permanently damage your coat.

If your label permits machine washing, preparation is key. First, turn your fake fur coat inside out. This protects the outer fur from agitation and friction during the wash cycle. Place the coat inside a large mesh laundry bag. A mesh bag provides an extra layer of protection. It prevents the fur from tangling or catching on other items in the machine. It also reduces shedding of fibers.

Use a front-loading washing machine if possible. Top-loading machines with agitators can be too harsh for faux fur. The agitator can tangle and damage the delicate fibers. If you only have a top-loader, ensure it has a gentle or hand-wash cycle and no central agitator. Choose the most delicate or gentle cycle setting on your machine. A "hand wash" or "delicate" cycle uses slow agitation and less spinning.

Always use cold water for washing fake fur. As mentioned before, hot water can melt or distort synthetic fibers. It can also cause the fur to lose its softness and become matted. Use a small amount of mild liquid detergent. Avoid powdered detergents, which may not dissolve completely and can leave residue. Do not use bleach or fabric softener. Bleach can damage the fibers, and fabric softener can make the fur feel greasy or look matted.

After the wash cycle finishes, remove the coat promptly. Do not leave it sitting in the machine. Excess moisture can harm the lining or create odors. Gently squeeze out any remaining water. Do not wring or twist the coat, as this can stretch or damage the fabric. Proceed immediately to the drying steps. Proper drying is crucial to restore the coat's texture.

## Drying Your Faux Fur Coat: The Right Way to Fluff

Drying your fake fur coat correctly is just as important as washing it. Incorrect drying can cause matting, damage, or even shrinkage. The goal is to dry the coat gently while preserving its soft, fluffy texture. Avoid using heat at all costs, as this is the biggest enemy of faux fur.

After washing, gently press out as much excess water as possible from the coat. Do not wring or twist it. You can roll the coat in a clean, dry towel to absorb more moisture. Press down firmly on the rolled towel. This method helps to remove a significant amount of water without stressing the fur fibers.

Hang your fake fur coat on a sturdy padded hanger. A padded hanger prevents shoulder bumps. Make sure the hanger can support the coat's weight when wet. Hang the coat in a well-ventilated area. Choose a spot away from direct sunlight or heat sources. A bathroom with an open window or a laundry room works well. Air circulation is crucial for efficient drying and preventing mildew.

Do not use a tumble dryer, even on a low-heat or no-heat setting. The heat from a dryer can melt the synthetic fibers. This causes the fur to become permanently matted, stiff, and possibly crunchy. Even a "tumble dry low" setting is usually too much heat for delicate faux fur. The tumbling action itself can also damage the fur.

While the coat is air drying, periodically fluff the fur. Gently shake the coat every few hours. You can also use a soft-bristled brush, like a pet slicker brush, to gently comb through the fur. Brush in the direction of the pile to separate the fibers. This step helps restore the coat's original fluffiness and prevents it from looking matted. Continue brushing and fluffing until the coat is completely dry.

Ensure the coat is fully dry before storing it or wearing it. Damp fur can develop mildew or unpleasant odors. It might take 24-48 hours for a fake fur coat to dry completely, depending on its thickness and humidity levels. Patience is key for a perfectly restored faux fur coat.

Similar to drying a suede coat, which requires careful air drying to prevent stiffness or damage, faux fur also benefits from a slow, gentle drying process.

## Maintaining Your Fake Fur's Luster and Softness

Cleaning your fake fur coat correctly is a great start. Proper ongoing maintenance also helps keep it looking its best for years. Regular care preserves its luster, softness, and overall appearance. A few simple habits can make a big difference.

First, regular brushing is essential. Use a soft-bristled brush or a pet slicker brush specifically designed for grooming. Gently brush your fake fur coat a few times a month, even if it does not look dirty. Brush in the direction of the fur's pile. This helps to remove loose dirt, dust, and lint. It also untangles fibers and prevents matting. Brushing keeps the fur soft and fluffy. It also helps to distribute any natural oils from your skin, maintaining a healthy sheen.

Proper storage is also crucial. When not wearing your fake fur coat, hang it on a sturdy, padded hanger. Avoid wire hangers, as they can cause creases or damage the shoulder area. Store the coat in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Sunlight can fade the color of the faux fur over time. Heat sources, like radiators, can also damage the fibers. Keep the coat in a breathable garment bag if you have one. This protects it from dust and airborne particles without trapping moisture.

Avoid exposing your fake fur coat to excessive friction. Do not carry heavy shoulder bags that rub against the fur. This can cause matting and wear in specific areas. If you sit for long periods, try to avoid squashing the fur on your back. Small adjustments can prevent permanent flattening.

Be mindful of perfumes, hairsprays, and other chemical products. These can stick to the fur fibers and attract dirt. They can also cause discoloration or make the fur feel sticky. Apply these products before putting on your coat. Allow them to dry completely. If chemicals do get on your coat, try to spot clean the area as soon as possible.

Following these maintenance tips extends the life of your fake fur coat. It helps it remain a beautiful and stylish part of your wardrobe. Consistent care means less need for deep cleaning. This keeps the fibers strong and vibrant.

Maintaining the appearance of synthetic materials often involves similar gentle cleaning and storage methods. For example, keeping costume jewelry looking its best requires careful handling to prevent tarnishing or damage.
