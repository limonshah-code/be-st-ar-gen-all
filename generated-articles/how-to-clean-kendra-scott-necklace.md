Cleaning your Kendra Scott necklace properly helps maintain its beauty and extends its life. This guide gives you simple steps and important tips. We will cover gentle cleaning methods, specific care for different finishes, and ways to keep your necklace looking new. You will learn how to clean Kendra Scott necklace items safely and effectively at home.

### How to clean a Kendra Scott necklace?

To clean a Kendra Scott necklace, use a soft cloth with mild soap and warm water. Gently wipe the surface, avoiding harsh chemicals. For plated items, ensure minimal water exposure. Always dry thoroughly to prevent tarnishing and maintain shine.

## Understanding Your Kendra Scott Necklace Materials

Before you begin cleaning, it is important to know what your Kendra Scott necklace is made of. Kendra Scott jewelry often features unique designs and a variety of materials. Knowing these materials helps you clean your necklace safely. Using the wrong method can damage delicate finishes.

Most Kendra Scott necklaces use base metals like brass. These metals are then plated with precious metals. Common plating options include 14K gold, rhodium, and rose gold. Rhodium plating provides a bright, silver-like finish and offers durability. Gold and rose gold plating give necklaces their specific color and shine.

Many Kendra Scott necklaces also feature natural stones, cultured pearls, or colored glass. These elements require careful handling. Some stones are porous, meaning they can absorb liquids. Others might be more delicate and prone to scratching. Always consider both the metal plating and any added embellishments when cleaning. I always check my specific necklace's description to be sure.

Knowing your necklace's composition helps you choose the gentlest cleaning method. This prevents accidental damage. It also ensures your Kendra Scott necklace stays beautiful for many years. Proper care preserves both its look and its value.

## Gentle Daily Cleaning for Your Kendra Scott Necklace

You can keep your Kendra Scott necklace looking fresh with gentle daily care. This routine removes everyday dirt and oils. It prevents buildup that can dull the necklace's shine. Regular, light cleaning is always better than aggressive, infrequent cleaning.

Start with a very soft, lint-free cloth. A microfiber cloth works very well. You can use this cloth to gently wipe down your necklace after each wear. This removes skin oils, makeup, and general grime. It is a simple step that makes a big difference.

For a slightly deeper clean, prepare a bowl of warm water with a tiny drop of mild dish soap. Use a soap that does not contain harsh detergents or abrasives. Dip your soft cloth into the soapy water. Wring out the cloth so it is just damp, not soaking wet.

Carefully wipe your Kendra Scott necklace with the damp cloth. Pay attention to any areas where dirt might collect, such as around stone settings or in chain links. Do not submerge the entire necklace in water, especially if it has stones or is plated. Water can seep into settings or accelerate plating wear. Rinse the cloth with clean water and wipe the necklace again to remove any soap residue. Finally, dry the necklace thoroughly with a separate dry, soft cloth. I like to let mine air dry for a few minutes too, just to be sure.

## Deep Cleaning Your Kendra Scott Necklace (When to Do It)

Sometimes, your Kendra Scott necklace needs more than just a daily wipe. If it looks very dull or has visible grime, it is time for a deeper clean. Do not do deep cleaning too often; once a month or every few months is usually enough. This prevents unnecessary wear on the plating.

For a deeper clean, you will use the same mild soap and warm water solution. This time, you can use a very soft brush, like a baby toothbrush. Gently brush the necklace, focusing on intricate designs or areas around stones. Be extremely careful not to scrub too hard. Hard scrubbing can scratch the plating or loosen stones.

After brushing, rinse the necklace carefully. You can do this by holding it under a very gentle stream of lukewarm water from the faucet. Ensure all soap residue is gone. For necklaces with delicate stones or intricate settings, you might prefer to use a damp cloth for rinsing instead. This provides more control. Remember, minimal water exposure is key for plated jewelry.

After rinsing, dry your Kendra Scott necklace completely. Use a clean, soft, lint-free cloth. Gently pat and buff the necklace until it is dry. Any moisture left behind can lead to water spots or accelerate tarnishing. I always take my time with this step. Ensuring it is perfectly dry helps maintain its shine.

## Specific Care for Different Kendra Scott Finishes

Kendra Scott necklaces come in various finishes, each needing slightly different care. Understanding these differences helps you protect your specific piece. The most common finishes are 14K gold plated, rhodium plated, and rose gold plated. Each type of plating requires gentle handling.

### Cleaning Gold Plated Kendra Scott Necklaces

Gold plated necklaces offer a warm, classic look. This plating is a thin layer of real gold over a base metal. It is delicate and can wear off over time with improper care. Always use mild soap and water. Avoid any abrasive cleaners or cloths. These can scratch the gold layer and expose the base metal underneath. Do not use chemical jewelry cleaners unless they are specifically labeled safe for gold-plated items. I find gentle hand wiping works best.

### Cleaning Rhodium Plated Kendra Scott Necklaces

Rhodium plating gives a bright, shiny, silver-like finish. It is often used for its durability and resistance to tarnish. Even though it is more durable than gold plating, it still needs gentle care. Follow the same mild soap and water method. Rhodium plating can also be damaged by harsh chemicals or excessive rubbing. It maintains its luster well with regular soft cloth wiping. This finish is less prone to tarnish than sterling silver, for example.

### Cleaning Rose Gold Plated Kendra Scott Necklaces

Rose gold plated necklaces have a beautiful, reddish-pink hue. This finish is also a thin layer over a base metal. Like gold plating, it is susceptible to wear. Use only soft cloths and mild solutions. Acidic substances, even common household ones, can react with the copper content in rose gold. This reaction can change its color or damage the plating. Always ensure you dry these pieces very well after cleaning.

Regardless of the finish, the key is always gentleness. Avoid ultrasonic cleaners, as their vibrations can damage plating or loosen stones. Do not use rough brushes or cloths. These actions can shorten the life of your beautiful Kendra Scott necklace. For general metal care, you might explore techniques used for solid silver, but remember Kendra Scott is plated and requires a much gentler touch. For instance, methods for a [silver necklace with baking soda](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-silver-necklace-with-baking-soda) are generally too abrasive for delicate plating, emphasizing the need for minimal friction on plated jewelry.

## Dealing with Tarnish on Kendra Scott Necklaces

Tarnish can make your Kendra Scott necklace look dull and discolored. It happens when metals react with air or chemicals. While Kendra Scott uses plating to help resist tarnish, it can still occur over time. This is especially true if the plating wears down. You want to address tarnish quickly to restore your necklace's appearance.

For light tarnish, often a gentle clean with mild soap and water is enough. Use a soft cloth to gently buff the affected area. Do not scrub hard. Hard scrubbing can remove the plating faster than the tarnish. This method works well for superficial dullness.

If tarnish is more stubborn, avoid harsh chemical cleaners. Many commercial jewelry cleaners are too strong for plated jewelry. They can strip the plating entirely. Instead, try a very dilute solution of mild soap and water with a tiny pinch of baking soda. Make sure the baking soda is fully dissolved. Apply this with a soft cloth and rub very gently. Rinse immediately and dry thoroughly. This is a very mild abrasive, so use it with extreme caution and only if necessary.

Some people suggest using polishing cloths designed for jewelry. If you choose this, ensure the cloth is specifically for plated jewelry. Many polishing cloths have abrasive compounds that will damage plating. Always read the product label carefully. I prefer to stick with methods that do not involve abrasives for my Kendra Scott pieces. Preventing tarnish through proper storage and regular gentle cleaning is always the best approach. It saves your necklace from needing drastic measures.

## Preventative Measures: Keeping Your Necklace Clean Longer

The best way to keep your Kendra Scott necklace clean is to prevent it from getting dirty in the first place. Simple habits can extend the time between cleanings. These tips help maintain the necklace's sparkle and protect its plating. I always follow these steps to keep my pieces looking new.

First, always put your necklace on last when getting ready. This means after applying makeup, perfume, hairspray, and lotions. These products contain chemicals that can react with the plating. They can cause discoloration or accelerate wear. Letting them dry completely before putting on jewelry avoids direct contact.

Second, take your necklace off first when getting home. Remove it before showering, swimming, or exercising. Water, especially chlorinated water or saltwater, is very damaging to plating. Sweat also contains chemicals that can cause tarnish. Even washing dishes with your necklace on can expose it to harsh soaps.

Third, store your Kendra Scott necklace properly. Humidity and air exposure are major causes of tarnish. Store your necklace in a dry, airtight container or a soft pouch. Many Kendra Scott pieces come with a small pouch. Using these pouches keeps air exposure to a minimum. Store each piece separately to prevent scratching. This also prevents chains from tangling, which can cause damage.

Finally, clean your necklace immediately if it gets wet or exposed to harsh elements. A quick wipe with a dry, soft cloth can prevent long-term damage. These preventative steps are simple. They make a huge difference in the longevity and beauty of your Kendra Scott necklace.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Kendra Scott Jewelry

Cleaning your Kendra Scott necklace seems simple, but common mistakes can cause irreversible damage. Knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do. Avoiding these pitfalls helps you protect your valuable accessories. I learned some of these the hard way.

**Mistake 1: Using Harsh Chemicals or Abrasives.**
Never use strong household cleaners on your Kendra Scott necklace. This includes bleach, ammonia, or abrasive powders. These chemicals strip away plating rapidly. They can also damage any stones. Even toothpaste, often suggested for silver, is too abrasive for delicate platings. Stick to mild dish soap and warm water.

**Mistake 2: Submerging Plated Jewelry.**
Avoid soaking your plated necklace in water for long periods. While a quick dip is okay for some items, prolonged submersion can cause water to seep into stone settings. It can also accelerate the deterioration of the plating. Use a damp cloth instead of full immersion for most cleaning.

**Mistake 3: Rubbing Too Hard.**
When cleaning, use gentle pressure. Aggressive scrubbing can physically abrade the thin layer of plating. This exposes the base metal underneath. Once the plating is gone, it is very difficult to restore at home. Always use a soft, lint-free cloth and light motions.

**Mistake 4: Using Ultrasonic Cleaners.**
Ultrasonic cleaners use vibrations to clean jewelry. While effective for solid gold or silver, they are not suitable for plated items. The vibrations can lift or chip the plating. They can also loosen or damage delicate stones. Keep your Kendra Scott pieces out of these machines.

**Mistake 5: Not Drying Thoroughly.**
Leaving moisture on your necklace is a common error. Water spots can form, and the remaining moisture can accelerate tarnishing or corrosion. Always dry your necklace completely with a soft, clean cloth after cleaning. Air drying alone may not be sufficient.

By avoiding these common mistakes, you ensure your Kendra Scott necklace remains in excellent condition. Proper care prolongs its life and keeps it looking as beautiful as the day you bought it.

## FAQ Section

### Can I use jewelry cleaner on Kendra Scott?
You should generally avoid commercial jewelry cleaners. Many of these cleaners contain harsh chemicals that can strip the delicate plating from Kendra Scott necklaces. Always check the cleaner's label to ensure it is specifically safe for plated jewelry. Mild soap and warm water are much safer options.

### How often should I clean my Kendra Scott necklace?
For daily maintenance, wipe your necklace with a soft cloth after each wear. A deeper clean with mild soap and water is usually needed every few weeks or once a month. This depends on how often you wear it and your activity level. Clean it immediately if it gets exposed to harsh chemicals.

### Why is my Kendra Scott necklace turning green?
If your Kendra Scott necklace turns green, it is usually due to the base metal, often brass, reacting with moisture or chemicals. This happens if the plating wears off. The copper in brass oxidizes, creating a green residue on your skin or the jewelry itself. Proper care helps prevent plating wear.

### How do I store my Kendra Scott necklace?
Store your Kendra Scott necklace in a dry, cool place away from direct sunlight. Use an airtight container, a soft jewelry pouch, or a jewelry box with individual compartments. This minimizes exposure to air and humidity, which cause tarnish. Store each piece separately to avoid scratches.

### Can I shower with my Kendra Scott necklace?
No, you should not shower with your Kendra Scott necklace. Water, especially hot water and soap, can accelerate the wear of the plating. It can also leave residue on the necklace. Always remove your jewelry before showering, swimming, or engaging in any water-related activities.
