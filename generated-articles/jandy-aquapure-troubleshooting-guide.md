### Understanding Your Jandy AquaPure System

The Jandy AquaPure system is a salt chlorine generator. It creates chlorine from salt in your pool water. This eliminates the need for traditional chlorine tablets or liquid chlorine. The system consists of a control panel and a salt cell.

The control panel manages the chlorine output. It displays important information like salt levels and error codes. The salt cell is where the magic happens. It uses electrolysis to turn salt into chlorine. These two parts work together. They keep your pool sanitized and clear.

It is important to understand how these parts function. This knowledge helps you identify problems early. A well-maintained system means less work for you. It also means a cleaner pool for your family. I find knowing my equipment helps me care for it better.

When the AquaPure works right, your pool water is always ready. You enjoy swimming more. You spend less time worrying about chemical balance. This guide will help you keep it running well.

### Decoding Jandy AquaPure Error Codes

Your Jandy AquaPure control panel displays error codes. These codes help you understand what is wrong. Recognizing these codes is the first step in troubleshooting. Each code points to a specific issue. We will review the most common ones.

*   **"LOW SALT"**: This code means your pool water has too little salt. The system cannot produce enough chlorine without proper salt levels. Add salt as directed by your system's manual. Re-test your salt level after the salt dissolves.
*   **"HIGH SALT"**: This code means your pool water has too much salt. High salt levels can damage the cell and reduce its lifespan. You need to drain some water from your pool. Then, refill it with fresh water. This dilutes the salt concentration. Repeat this process until the salt level is correct.
*   **"CELL"**: This error typically means the cell needs cleaning. Mineral buildup, called scaling, can block the cell's plates. This prevents chlorine production. You should clean the cell following manufacturer instructions. A [guide on how to clean a Jandy salt cell](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-jandy-salt-cell) can provide detailed steps.
*   **"HOT"**: This code indicates that the water temperature is too high. The AquaPure system might shut down in high temperatures. This prevents damage. Ensure your pool water temperature is within the safe operating range. Check if your pool heater is working correctly. You can also refer to troubleshooting information for [Jandy pool heater issues](https://beacleaner.com/jandy-pool-heater-troubleshooting) if applicable.
*   **"PSc" or "Power Supply Communication Error"**: This means the control panel cannot communicate with the power supply. Check all wiring connections. Ensure they are secure and free of corrosion. Sometimes, resetting the circuit breaker fixes this. If the issue persists, you might have a faulty power supply.
*   **"COM" or "Communication Error"**: Similar to "PSc," this points to a communication issue between components. This often involves the main circuit board or its connection to the cell. Ensure all plugs are seated firmly.
*   **"CHECK SYSTEM"**: This is a general error. It means the system detects an issue but cannot specify it with a unique code. You will need to check other potential problems like flow, power, or cell condition. This requires a more thorough inspection of the system.
*   **"SERVICE"**: This code often appears after extended use. It suggests that the cell is nearing its end of life. While you can try cleaning it, prepare for a cell replacement soon. This light might also come on if other system parameters are severely out of range.

Understanding these codes helps you fix problems faster. When I see an error code, I first consult this list. Then, I take specific action. This saves time and prevents larger issues.

### Addressing Low/No Chlorine Production

One of the most common complaints is low or no chlorine production. Your Jandy AquaPure system should keep your pool sanitized. If it does not, your water quality will suffer. Many factors contribute to this problem. I will walk you through them.

First, check your salt level. The system needs a specific salt concentration to work. If the level is too low, the system cannot produce chlorine. Refer to your owner's manual for the ideal range. Add pool-grade salt if needed. Make sure the salt dissolves completely before retesting.

Next, inspect the salt cell for scaling. Over time, calcium and other minerals can build up on the cell's plates. This buildup insulates the plates. It prevents the electrolytic process. A dirty cell means little to no chlorine production. This is a very common issue. You can find detailed instructions on [how to clean your Jandy salt cell](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-jandy-salt-cell) in a separate guide. Regular cleaning extends cell life and ensures proper function. I clean my cell every few months.

Third, ensure you have proper water flow. The AquaPure cell requires water flow to operate. If the pump is off, or if there is a blockage, no chlorine will be made. Check your pump and filter system. Ensure they work correctly. A dirty filter or a closed valve can restrict water flow. The flow switch also needs to be working. We will discuss flow issues more in another section.

Fourth, check the chlorine output setting. Your AquaPure control panel has a setting for chlorine production percentage. If this is set too low, your pool will not get enough chlorine. Increase the output percentage if your pool needs more chlorine. Adjust it based on your pool's needs and bather load. I often adjust mine based on the season.

Finally, consider your pool water chemistry. Even with proper salt and a clean cell, poor water chemistry affects chlorine effectiveness. High pH or high cyanuric acid (stabilizer) can reduce chlorine's power. Test your pH, alkalinity, and CYA levels. Adjust them as needed. We will cover water chemistry in more detail soon. Addressing these points will likely solve most low chlorine problems.

### Troubleshooting AquaPure Control Panel Issues

The control panel is the brain of your Jandy AquaPure system. When it acts up, it can be frustrating. Problems can range from a blank display to unresponsive buttons. I will help you tackle these common control panel issues.

If your control panel display is blank, first check the power supply. Ensure the circuit breaker for your pool equipment is on. Check all wiring connections. Look for loose wires or signs of corrosion. Sometimes, simply resetting the breaker can bring the display back to life. A power surge might have caused a temporary glitch.

If buttons are unresponsive, try a system reset. Turn off the main power to your pool equipment at the breaker for a few minutes. Then turn it back on. This often clears minor software glitches. If specific buttons still do not work, the button pad itself might be faulty. In some cases, the entire control board might need replacement. This is a job for a professional.

Communication errors between the control panel and other components are also possible. The "PSc" or "COM" codes discussed earlier point to this. These errors mean the panel cannot talk to the power supply or the cell. Check the data cable connecting the panel to the power center. Ensure it is securely plugged in at both ends. Look for any damage to the cable. Damaged cables stop data flow.

Sometimes, the internal fuses on the power supply board can blow. This results in a non-responsive panel. Inspect these fuses. Replace any blown fuses with the correct type. Always disconnect power before checking fuses. This is a safety measure. If you are unsure, call a professional.

Keep your control panel clean and dry. Exposure to water or excessive humidity can cause internal damage. A damaged control panel often requires replacement. This can be costly. Regular care helps prevent these problems. I always make sure my panel cover is secure.

### Dealing with Jandy AquaPure Cell Problems

The salt cell is the heart of your Jandy AquaPure system. It is where chlorine generation occurs. Problems with the cell are common causes of system malfunction. I will explain how to handle these issues.

The most frequent cell problem is scaling. Calcium and other minerals build up on the titanium plates inside the cell. This mineral layer prevents the cell from converting salt into chlorine efficiently. You will notice reduced chlorine output. The "CELL" error code often appears. Regular cleaning prevents this buildup. For a thorough guide, refer to our [article on how to clean a Jandy salt chlorinator cell](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-jandy-chlorinator-cell). Cleaning involves soaking the cell in a mild acid solution. Always follow safety precautions.

Next, inspect the cell for physical damage. Look for cracks in the housing or damaged plates. Corrosion can also occur over time. If you see signs of wear or damage, the cell might need replacement. A visually damaged cell will not work properly. Hairline cracks can cause leaks.

Check the cell cable connections. Ensure the cable from the power center is securely plugged into the cell. Loose connections can interrupt power flow. This leads to no chlorine production. Also, examine the cable for fraying or damage. A damaged cable needs replacement.

The lifespan of a Jandy AquaPure cell is typically 3 to 5 years. This depends on usage, water chemistry, and cleaning frequency. As cells age, their efficiency drops. You might notice you need to run your system at a higher percentage to maintain chlorine. Or, the "SERVICE" light might come on more often. If your cell is old and cleaning does not help, it is likely time for a new one.

Sometimes, issues with the flow switch can be mistaken for cell problems. The flow switch tells the system that water is flowing. If it malfunctions, the system will not activate the cell. Ensure the flow switch is clean. Make sure it is installed in the correct direction. We will cover flow issues next. Properly handling cell issues ensures consistent sanitation. I make it a point to inspect my cell regularly.

### Resolving Flow Sensor and Water Flow Problems

Proper water flow is critical for your Jandy AquaPure system. The salt cell needs water moving through it to produce chlorine. A flow sensor detects this movement. If there is insufficient flow, the system will not turn on the cell. This prevents damage. I will help you diagnose flow-related issues.

First, check your pool pump. The pump creates the water flow. Ensure your pump is running and priming correctly. A weak pump, air in the system, or a dirty pump basket reduces flow. Clean the pump basket if it is full of debris. Ensure all valves are open.

Next, inspect your pool filter. A dirty or clogged filter severely restricts water flow. Backwash a sand or DE filter. Clean or replace cartridge filters. A clean filter ensures maximum flow to your AquaPure cell. This is often overlooked.

The Jandy AquaPure system uses a flow sensor. This sensor tells the control board if water is moving. If the sensor is dirty or faulty, it might incorrectly report no flow. The AquaPure unit will then not produce chlorine. Remove the flow sensor and check it. Look for debris or calcium buildup on the sensor probe. Clean it gently if it is dirty. Ensure it is installed in the correct direction, usually indicated by an arrow.

Check for air in your plumbing lines. Air bubbles can disrupt the flow sensor's reading. Look for air leaks around the pump lid or plumbing connections. Tighten any loose fittings. Bleed air from the system if needed.

Ensure the bypass valve (if present) around the cell is not fully open. Some installations have a bypass to reduce flow through the cell. If it is open too much, not enough water goes through the cell. Close it slightly to direct more water through the AquaPure unit.

Finally, verify that pool returns are not obstructed. Blocked return jets can cause back pressure. This affects overall system flow. Ensuring clear water movement through your entire pool system helps your AquaPure function correctly. These checks keep your pool water moving freely. They allow the AquaPure to do its job.

### Maintaining Optimal Water Chemistry for AquaPure

Proper water chemistry is vital for your Jandy AquaPure system. It impacts chlorine production and cell longevity. Imbalanced water can cause many problems. I will guide you through the key parameters.

First, maintain your salt level within the recommended range. For Jandy AquaPure systems, this is typically 2800-3800 ppm (parts per million), with an ideal level around 3200 ppm. Too low, and the system struggles to produce chlorine. Too high, and it can damage the cell. Always use pool-grade salt. Do not use table salt. I test my salt level monthly.

Second, control your pH level. The ideal pH for pools is 7.4-7.6. High pH reduces chlorine effectiveness. It also promotes calcium scaling on the cell. Low pH can be corrosive to equipment. Use pH increasers or decreasers to adjust as needed. Maintaining pH helps chlorine work better.

Third, manage your cyanuric acid (CYA) level. CYA stabilizes chlorine. It protects it from UV breakdown. The ideal range for salt water pools is 60-80 ppm. If CYA is too low, chlorine dissipates quickly. If it is too high, it binds up chlorine, making it ineffective. High CYA is hard to lower without draining water. This is why I always check CYA levels.

Fourth, check your calcium hardness. Recommended levels are 200-400 ppm. High calcium hardness increases the risk of scaling on the cell plates. Low calcium can make the water corrosive. Adjust calcium hardness with calcium chloride if it is too low.

Fifth, ensure total alkalinity is correct. Ideal total alkalinity is 80-120 ppm. This parameter buffers pH changes. It helps keep your pH stable. Adjust with alkalinity increaser or muriatic acid.

Regular testing is crucial. I recommend testing your water at least once a week. This helps you catch imbalances early. Balanced water chemistry makes your Jandy AquaPure system work efficiently. It also extends the life of your equipment. This proactive approach saves money and effort in the long run.

### Power Supply and Wiring Checks for Jandy AquaPure

Electrical issues can prevent your Jandy AquaPure system from working. A proper power supply is essential for operation. I will explain how to check common power-related problems. Safety comes first when working with electricity.

Always start by checking your circuit breaker. Find the breaker switch that controls your pool equipment. Ensure it is in the "ON" position. If it tripped, reset it. If it trips again immediately, you might have a short circuit or an overload. Do not keep resetting a tripping breaker. This indicates a serious electrical problem.

Next, inspect all wiring connections. Look for loose wires or signs of corrosion at the power center. Check connections to the control panel and the salt cell. All connections must be secure and clean. Loose connections prevent proper power flow. They can also create heat and cause damage.

Examine the power cord itself. Look for any cuts, fraying, or visible damage. A damaged cord is a safety hazard. It can also prevent the system from getting power. Replace any damaged cords immediately.

Check the transformer inside the power supply. A faulty transformer will not provide the correct voltage to the system. This can lead to various malfunctions or no operation at all. This check often requires opening the power supply housing. If you are not comfortable, call a professional.

Some AquaPure models have internal fuses within the power supply. These fuses protect the system from power surges. If a fuse blows, it breaks the circuit. The system will not work. Locate these fuses and inspect them. Replace any blown fuses with a fuse of the exact same rating. Incorrect fuses can cause further damage.

If you have performed these checks and the system still has no power, the issue might be internal to the power supply unit itself. A malfunctioning power supply might need repair or replacement. In such cases, professional help is recommended. Working with high voltage electricity can be dangerous. I always ensure power is off before touching any wiring.

### When to Call a Professional: Advanced AquaPure Problems

Sometimes, troubleshooting on your own reaches its limits. Certain Jandy AquaPure problems require expert knowledge. Knowing when to call a professional saves you time and prevents further damage. I will help you identify these situations.

You should call a professional if you suspect a faulty circuit board. The control panel or power supply contains complex circuit boards. Diagnosing and replacing these parts needs specialized tools and expertise. Incorrect handling can cause more damage. It can also void your warranty.

Any persistent electrical issue warrants a professional. If circuit breakers keep tripping, or if you detect burning smells, get help. These are serious safety hazards. A qualified electrician or pool technician can safely diagnose wiring problems. They can fix issues within the power supply. Do not attempt electrical repairs beyond basic breaker resets yourself.

If your Jandy AquaPure system is still under warranty, contact Zodiac/Jandy support or a certified service technician. Attempting DIY repairs on a warranted unit can void your coverage. Professionals ensure repairs meet warranty requirements. They use approved parts.

You should also call for help if you have tried all common troubleshooting steps. If you have checked salt levels, cleaned the cell, verified flow, and addressed error codes, but the problem persists, it is time for an expert. Complex internal component failures are hard to diagnose without proper diagnostic equipment.

Finally, if you are simply uncomfortable with any step, call a professional. Your safety is paramount. Pool equipment involves water and electricity. This combination can be dangerous. Professionals have the training and experience to work safely. They also have access to specific Jandy parts and technical support. Recognizing your limits is a sign of good judgment. I always call for help when a problem goes beyond my comfort level.
