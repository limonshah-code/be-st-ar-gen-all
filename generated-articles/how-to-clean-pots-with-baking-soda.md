Before you begin cleaning your pots, gather your materials. Having everything ready makes the process smooth. You will need a few simple items. Most are probably already in your home.

This includes your box of baking soda. You will also need dish soap. A sponge or non-abrasive scrubber is important. Warm water is always helpful. For tougher jobs, you might want a plastic scraper. This avoids scratching your pot surface.

It is a good idea to remove any loose food first. Scrape off large pieces. This helps the baking soda work better. Protect your hands with gloves if you wish. This keeps your skin from drying out.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning General Pot Stains

Many pots gather everyday cooking stains. These are usually easy to remove with baking soda. This method works well for light discoloration or sticky residues. It is a gentle yet effective approach.

First, rinse your pot with warm water. Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda on the stained areas. Add a few drops of dish soap. Use a damp sponge or scrubber. Gently rub the affected surfaces.

The baking soda acts as a mild abrasive. It lifts the grime. The soap helps cut through grease. Continue scrubbing until the stains disappear. Rinse your pot thoroughly with warm water. Your pot should look much better now.

## Tackling Burnt Food in Pots with Baking Soda

Burnt food is a common kitchen disaster. It can feel impossible to remove. But baking soda is a hero for this challenge. It helps lift even the most stubborn, charred bits.

First, fill the bottom of the burnt pot with water. Add a generous amount of baking soda to the water. I usually add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup, depending on the pot size. Bring the water to a gentle boil on the stove. Let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.

The boiling water softens the burnt residue. The baking soda helps break it down. After simmering, let the pot cool. Scrape away the loosened food with a plastic scraper. You can also use a non-abrasive sponge. For very tough spots, make a paste. Mix baking soda with a little water. Apply it to the stubborn areas. Let it sit for a while, then scrub. This method also works well for burnt food on baking sheets.

## Deep Cleaning Pots with Baking Soda and Vinegar

Sometimes, pots need extra power. Combining baking soda with vinegar creates a powerful fizzing reaction. This can tackle really tough stains and grime. It's especially effective for burnt-on food or lingering odors.

First, sprinkle a thick layer of baking soda over the bottom of your pot. Make sure it covers all the stained areas. Next, pour white vinegar directly over the baking soda. You will see it immediately fizz and bubble. This reaction is what helps lift the grime.

Let the mixture sit for at least 30 minutes. For very stubborn stains, let it sit for a few hours or even overnight. After soaking, pour out the liquid. Scrub the pot with a non-abrasive sponge. The residue should come off much easier. Rinse well. This powerful combination is also fantastic for other household cleaning tasks, like learning [how to clean with vinegar and baking soda](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-with-vinegar-and-baking-soda) in general. It even works wonders for large appliances; for instance, you can try cleaning your [dishwasher with vinegar and baking soda](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-with-vinegar-and-baking-soda) to remove grime and odors.

## Specific Pot Materials and Baking Soda Cleaning

Baking soda is versatile. It works on many pot materials. However, each material might need a slightly different approach. Knowing these nuances helps you clean effectively without damage.

### Stainless Steel Pots

Stainless steel pots love baking soda. For everyday cleaning, a paste of baking soda and water works wonders. Apply, scrub, and rinse. For stubborn stains, especially heat tints or discoloration, sprinkle dry baking soda. Add a bit of water to make a slurry. Scrub with the grain of the steel. This helps remove discoloration and restores shine.

### Non-Stick Pots

Use baking soda gently on non-stick surfaces. A paste can be too abrasive if scrubbed too hard. Instead, sprinkle baking soda into the pot. Fill it with water and bring it to a boil. Let it simmer for 5-10 minutes. This softens burnt food. Then, gently wipe with a soft sponge. Never use harsh scrubbers or metal tools.

### Cast Iron Pots

Cast iron pots need care. They can rust. For cleaning, sprinkle baking soda over any stubborn spots. Add a little water to make a paste. Scrub gently with a non-abrasive brush or sponge. Rinse quickly. Make sure to dry cast iron immediately and thoroughly. Re-season if needed after cleaning.

### Copper Pots

Copper pots can tarnish. Baking soda and lemon juice or vinegar make a great cleaner. Mix equal parts baking soda and lemon juice (or vinegar) to form a paste. Apply it to the copper surface. Let it sit for a few minutes. Gently rub with a soft cloth. This removes tarnish and brings back the shine. Rinse thoroughly and dry completely. Baking soda also effectively cleans other metallic items, such as for removing tarnish from [silverware](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-silverware-with-baking-soda).

## Maintaining Clean Pots and Preventing Stains

Cleaning is one part of the equation. Maintaining your pots keeps them looking new. It also makes future cleaning much easier. Simple habits go a long way in preventing stubborn stains and buildup.

Always clean your pots soon after use. Do not let food sit and dry onto the surface. This creates much harder stains. Soaking a dirty pot in warm, soapy water immediately helps. This loosens food particles.

Consider the heat you use for cooking. High heat can cause food to burn more easily. It also creates heat stains on stainless steel. Adjust your cooking temperatures as needed. Using the right tools also helps. Avoid metal utensils on non-stick surfaces. This prevents scratches.

Regular deep cleaning helps too. Even if your pots look clean, a monthly baking soda treatment can refresh them. This prevents minor buildups from becoming major problems. Baking soda also works well for other kitchen appliances, like when you need to clean your [coffee maker with baking soda](https://beacleaner.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-coffee-maker-with-baking-soda) to remove mineral deposits and old coffee residue. Taking these steps extends the life and beauty of your cookware.

## When to Avoid Baking Soda on Pots

While baking soda is fantastic, it's not always the best choice. Some materials can be damaged by its abrasive nature or alkaline properties. Knowing these exceptions protects your cookware.

Avoid using baking soda on aluminum pots, especially anodized aluminum. Baking soda can cause discoloration or pitting on these surfaces. It might leave dark spots or dull the finish. For aluminum, stick to dish soap and water.

Also, be careful with extremely delicate or antique cookware. This includes some very old, thin-gauge copper or certain decorative enamels. Test a small, hidden area first. If you see any adverse reaction, stop using it. Always use gentle scrubbing tools. Never use steel wool with baking soda on any pot. Steel wool can scratch surfaces and remove protective layers.
