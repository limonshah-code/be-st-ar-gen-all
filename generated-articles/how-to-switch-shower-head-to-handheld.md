## Upgrade Your Shower: How To Switch To A Handheld Shower Head

Have you thought about making your daily shower more comfortable? I certainly have. Switching your old shower head to a versatile handheld model can make a big difference. This simple DIY project offers many benefits. It gives you greater control over water flow. It also makes cleaning your shower much easier.

Many people wonder how difficult this task might be. The good news is that it is often a straightforward process. You do not need special plumbing skills. You just need a few basic tools. This article will guide you through each step. I will show you how to choose the right handheld shower head. We will cover how to remove your old fixture. You will learn to install the new one properly. Get ready to enjoy a more flexible shower experience.

### Takeaway:

*   Replacing your standard shower head with a handheld unit is a simple home improvement project.
*   You only need basic tools like a wrench and plumbers tape.
*   Proper preparation, including turning off water and gathering tools, ensures a smooth process.
*   Removing the old head and installing the new one involves basic unscrewing and screwing.
*   A handheld shower head offers convenience for bathing, cleaning, and pet washing.

To switch your shower head to a handheld unit, first turn off the water supply to the shower. Then, unscrew the old shower head from the shower arm. Clean the threads. Apply new plumber's tape. Attach the new handheld shower head assembly, tightening it by hand, then gently with a wrench. Finally, check for leaks.

## Why Choose a Handheld Shower Head? Exploring the Benefits

Many people enjoy the convenience of a handheld shower head. It makes showering more comfortable for different needs. Think about bathing children or washing pets. A handheld unit helps rinse hard-to-reach areas. It gives you better control over the water stream. This flexibility is a big advantage.

I find that handheld shower heads also make cleaning simpler. You can direct water exactly where you need it. This helps rinse soap scum from shower walls or bathtubs. It is much easier than splashing water with a fixed head. This small change can greatly improve your bathroomâ€™s function.

Handheld models come in various styles. You can choose one that matches your bathroom decor. Some models offer multiple spray settings. These settings give you different water pressures. You might like a gentle mist or a strong massage spray. This personalizes your shower experience. It makes every wash feel better.

## Selecting the Right Handheld Shower Head

Choosing the correct handheld shower head is important. Many types exist. You need to consider size, style, and features. First, think about your existing shower setup. Most shower arms have a standard thread size. This makes most handheld shower heads compatible. You will connect the new hose to this arm.

Consider the material of the shower head. Metal options are durable. Plastic ones are lighter and less expensive. Decide what is best for your budget and needs. Look for good quality in the hose material too. A flexible, long-lasting hose prevents kinks and leaks.

Think about the spray settings. Do you want a rain shower, a pulsating massage, or a soft spray? Many handheld units offer multiple options. Some even have pause buttons. This lets you stop water flow without adjusting temperature. Read reviews to find reliable brands. This helps ensure your new shower head performs well.

When you install a new shower head, you might also consider upgrading your main shower head if you want a dual setup. Some people like to [install a rain shower head with handheld](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-install-a-rain-shower-head-with-handheld) for a luxurious experience. This setup gives you the best of both worlds. You get the wide coverage of a rain head and the focused spray of a handheld.

## Essential Tools and Materials You Will Need

Before you start, gather all your tools. Having everything ready saves time. It makes the installation process smooth. You will need just a few common items. These are easy to find at any hardware store.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Adjustable Wrench:** This helps loosen and tighten fittings.
*   **Plumber's Tape (PTFE tape):** This white tape seals pipe threads. It prevents leaks.
*   **Soft Cloth or Rag:** Protects finishes from scratches. It also helps grip slippery parts.
*   **Pliers (optional):** Sometimes useful for stubborn old shower heads.
*   **Handheld Shower Head Kit:** This includes the shower head, hose, and mounting bracket.

I always recommend having a small bucket nearby. It can catch any leftover water when you remove the old head. This keeps your bathroom floor dry. Make sure the plumber's tape is new and clean. Old, dirty tape might not seal well. With these items, you are ready to begin.

You might encounter a very stuck old shower head. Sometimes, hard water deposits cause this. If you are struggling to remove it, you might find tips on [how to get an old shower head off](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-get-an-old-shower-head-off) helpful. This can save you frustration and effort during removal. Having the right method for a stubborn fixture is important.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Removing Your Old Shower Head

Taking off the old shower head is the first real step. It is usually quite simple. Follow these instructions carefully. This ensures you do not damage your plumbing. Always work gently.

### 1. Turn Off the Water Supply

This step is critical. You must stop water flow to the shower. Find the main water shut-off valve for your home. It might be in your basement, utility closet, or outside. Turn it off completely. Some homes have individual shut-off valves for each bathroom. If yours does, use that one. Turning off the water prevents floods when you disconnect the old head.

### 2. Prepare for Removal

Place a towel or small bucket below the shower arm. This catches any drips. Water always stays in the pipes, even after shutting off the main supply. Having a catch basin prevents a mess. You should also have your tools ready. Keep your adjustable wrench and a soft cloth nearby.

### 3. Loosen the Old Shower Head

Hold the shower arm firmly with one hand. Use your adjustable wrench with the other. Place the wrench on the flat part of the shower head base. Turn the wrench counter-clockwise. This loosens the old head. If the head is stubborn, try wiggling it gently. A soft cloth wrapped around the head can give you better grip. It also protects the finish.

Sometimes, an old shower head can be very tight. Mineral deposits build up over time. If you cannot get it off easily, you might need extra leverage. You can look up how to [how to loosen shower head](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-loosen-shower-head) for more specific tricks. These might include using a heat gun or penetrating oil. Be careful not to damage the pipe.

### 4. Unscrew the Old Shower Head

Once loose, continue turning the shower head counter-clockwise by hand. It should unscrew easily now. As it comes off, water may drip out. This is normal. Let it drain into your towel or bucket. Set the old shower head aside. You will not need it for your new installation.

### 5. Clean the Shower Arm Threads

Look at the threads on the shower arm. You might see old plumber's tape or mineral buildup. Use a soft brush or your finger to remove any debris. A clean surface helps the new seal form correctly. A smooth, clean thread ensures no leaks with your new handheld shower. This prepares the pipe for the next steps.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Installing Your New Handheld Shower Head

Installing the new handheld shower head is just as simple as removing the old one. You will essentially reverse the process. Follow these steps for a secure and leak-free setup.

### 1. Apply New Plumber's Tape

Take your roll of plumber's tape. Wrap it clockwise around the threads of the shower arm. Apply 3-5 layers of tape. Make sure the tape lies flat and smooth. Overlapping slightly is fine. Plumber's tape creates a watertight seal. It fills small gaps in the threads. This step is crucial for preventing leaks.

### 2. Attach the Diverter Valve (if included)

Some handheld shower head kits include a diverter valve. This valve lets you switch water between a fixed shower head and the handheld. If your kit has one, screw it onto the shower arm threads. Turn it clockwise until it is hand-tight. Then, use your adjustable wrench to tighten it another quarter to half turn. Do not overtighten. Overtightening can crack the plastic or strip the threads.

### 3. Install the Handheld Hose

The handheld shower head comes with a flexible hose. One end of the hose connects to the diverter valve or directly to the shower arm. The other end attaches to the handheld shower head itself. Screw the hose onto the outlet on the diverter or shower arm. Make sure the rubber washer is inside the hose fitting. This washer helps seal the connection. Hand-tighten this connection.

### 4. Connect the Handheld Shower Head

Now, screw the handheld shower head onto the other end of the hose. Again, ensure the rubber washer is in place. Hand-tighten this connection as well. The connections should feel snug. Avoid using a wrench on these parts if they are plastic. Hand-tightening is usually enough for these hose connections.

### 5. Mount the Holder Bracket

Most handheld shower head kits include a mounting bracket. This bracket holds the handheld shower head when not in use. It typically attaches to the wall with adhesive or screws. If it is adhesive, clean the wall surface first. Peel off the backing and press firmly. If it uses screws, mark the spots and drill pilot holes. Mount the bracket securely. Place the handheld shower head into its new holder.

## Testing Your New Handheld Shower Head

After installation, it is time to check your work. Testing properly prevents future problems. This step makes sure everything is secure and leak-free. Follow these final checks.

### 1. Restore Water Supply

Go back to your main water shut-off valve. Slowly turn the water supply back on. Listen for any strange noises in the pipes. A little gurgling is normal. Once the water is fully on, return to the bathroom.

### 2. Check for Leaks

Inspect all connections. Look closely at where the shower arm meets the wall. Check the diverter valve connections. Examine where the hose connects to the diverter. Also, check the connection between the hose and the handheld shower head. Look for any drips. If you see water, gently tighten the leaking connection with your wrench. Do not overtighten. A small drip can become a big problem.

### 3. Test Water Flow and Spray Settings

Turn on the shower. Let water run through the new handheld shower head. Check the water pressure. Test all the spray settings if your model has them. Make sure the water flows freely. There should be no blockages. Direct the water away from yourself at first. This prevents a cold surprise.

### 4. Check the Holder Bracket

Ensure the handheld shower head sits securely in its holder. Wiggle it slightly. It should feel stable. If it is loose, adjust the bracket mounting. Make sure it can support the weight of the shower head when full of water. A loose bracket could cause the shower head to fall.

If you notice any issues with water flow or clogging in the future, it might be time for maintenance. Knowing [how to clean shower head](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shower-head) can help you keep your new fixture working perfectly for years. Regular cleaning prevents mineral buildup and maintains good pressure.

## Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

Even simple projects can have small hiccups. Do not worry if you encounter a problem. Most issues are easy to fix. I will share some common problems and their solutions.

### Leaks at Connections

Leaks are the most common issue. You might see water dripping from one of the threaded connections.

*   **Solution:** Turn off the water supply again. Unscrew the leaking part. Remove the old plumber's tape. Apply 5-7 fresh layers of plumber's tape. Make sure it wraps clockwise and covers all threads. Re-tighten the connection. Remember, hand-tighten, then an additional quarter to half turn with a wrench. Do not overtighten. If the leak persists, check if the rubber washer inside the fitting is present and undamaged. Replace it if needed.

### Low Water Pressure

After installation, your shower might have weaker water flow.

*   **Solution:** First, check if the shower head has a flow restrictor. Many modern shower heads include these. They are small plastic discs inside the shower head or hose connection. You can often remove these. Use needle-nose pliers to pull them out. Removing the restrictor will increase water pressure. Also, ensure your main water supply is fully open. Sometimes, air can get trapped in the lines. Run the shower for a few minutes to clear any air.

### Shower Head Not Staying in Holder

If your handheld shower head keeps falling out of its bracket, the bracket might be loose.

*   **Solution:** If the bracket uses adhesive, the wall might not have been clean enough. Remove it, clean the wall thoroughly with rubbing alcohol, let it dry, and reapply with a stronger adhesive if needed. If it uses screws, tighten the screws. The bracket might also be angled incorrectly. Adjust its position if possible. Some holders are not universal. Ensure your holder is designed for your specific shower head model.

### Kinked Hose

The flexible hose might kink, restricting water flow or looking messy.

*   **Solution:** When installing, ensure the hose hangs freely. Avoid sharp bends. If a kink forms, gently straighten it out. You might need to adjust the mounting position of the bracket to allow for a smoother curve in the hose. If the hose kinks easily, it might be a lower quality material. Replacing it with a higher-quality, more flexible hose could be an option. Remember that the hose material matters for durability.

## Maintaining Your Handheld Shower Head

Proper maintenance extends the life of your new handheld shower head. It also keeps water flowing smoothly. Regular cleaning is key. I always make sure to keep my shower head clean.

### Regular Cleaning

Mineral deposits, like limescale, can build up. This is especially true if you have hard water. These deposits can clog the spray nozzles. They reduce water pressure over time.

*   **How to clean:** Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Soak the shower head in this solution for a few hours. For very stubborn buildup, soak it overnight. You can put the shower head in a plastic bag filled with the solution. Tie the bag around the shower arm. After soaking, use an old toothbrush to scrub away any remaining deposits. Rinse thoroughly with clean water.

For specific guidance on cleaning, you can refer to articles like [how to clean hard water from shower head](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hard-water-from-shower-head). This helps keep your new handheld unit sparkling. It ensures consistent performance. Regular cleaning prevents major issues.

### Inspecting for Wear and Tear

Periodically check the hose for cracks or leaks. Look at the connections for signs of corrosion. The rubber washers inside the connections can degrade over time.

*   **What to do:** If you see cracks in the hose, replace it. Leaking washers need replacement too. These parts are inexpensive. Replacing them prevents bigger problems. A small leak can waste water. It can also damage bathroom fixtures over time.

### Addressing Low Pressure

Even with regular cleaning, pressure might drop. This could be due to internal build-up beyond the nozzles.

*   **What to do:** If cleaning does not help, consider disassembling the shower head. Follow the manufacturer's instructions. Clean internal screens or filters. Some shower heads have flow restrictors that can be removed. Ensure all internal components are clean. Reassemble carefully.

Handheld shower heads are durable. With a little care, they will serve you well for many years. Regular checks catch problems early. This saves you money and hassle.
