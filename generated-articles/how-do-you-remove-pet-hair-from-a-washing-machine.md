## Effective Ways to Remove Pet Hair from Your Washing Machine

Having furry friends brings so much joy into our lives. But let's be honest, it also brings pet hair, seemingly everywhere. You might even find it clinging stubbornly inside your washing machine after a load of laundry. I know the feeling; it's frustrating to pull out supposedly clean clothes only to see them still covered in dog or cat hair. This lingering hair not only re-deposits onto your next laundry load but can also clog your machine's drain system over time.

You are here because you need to know how to remove pet hair from a washing machine effectively. This comprehensive guide will walk you through proven methods, from pre-treatment steps to deep cleaning your appliance. We will cover the specific components of your washing machine that attract and hold hair, explaining how to clean each one. By the end, you will have a clear action plan to keep your clothes and your washing machine free from pet hair.

### Takeaway

*   **Pre-treat clothes:** Remove as much hair as possible before washing.
*   **Clean machine components:** Focus on the drum, gasket, and filter.
*   **Run self-clean cycles:** Use hot water with vinegar or bleach.
*   **Regular maintenance:** Prevent future build-up with consistent habits.

To remove pet hair from a washing machine, first, pre-treat clothes to remove excess hair. Next, clean the machine's interior drum and rubber gasket. Then, check and clear the drain pump filter. Finally, run a hot wash cycle with a cleaning agent like vinegar or bleach to flush out remaining debris. Regular cleaning prevents build-up.

## Understanding Why Pet Hair Sticks to Your Washing Machine

Have you ever wondered why pet hair seems to cling inside your washing machine, even after a full cycle? It is a common problem for pet owners. Understanding why this happens helps us tackle the issue more effectively. Pet hair is very light. It can become airborne easily. Once hair gets into the washing machine with your clothes, water plays a role.

When clothes get wet, the fibers absorb water. This causes the hair to stick to the fabric and to the machine's interior surfaces. Static electricity also plays a part. Dryer sheets are often used to reduce static cling in dryers. However, in a washer, without a drying agent, hair can stick due to electrostatic forces. As the machine agitates, the hair sheds from clothes. Instead of washing away cleanly, some hair gets trapped. It can stick to the sides of the drum, inside the rubber gasket, or even get pushed into the machine's drainage system.

The design of your washing machine also influences where hair goes. Front-loading machines have a rubber gasket around the door. This gasket often traps hair, lint, and even small objects. Top-loading machines may have an agitator. Hair can collect around the base of the agitator or stick to the drum walls. Over time, this trapped hair builds up. It can become a sticky mess, especially when combined with detergent residue and dirt. This residue makes it harder for new hair to rinse away. It creates a cycle where hair accumulates more easily.

Additionally, the type of fabric you wash matters. Some fabrics, like fleece or towels, are known for attracting and holding onto pet hair. When these items are washed, they release a large amount of hair. This overwhelms the machine's ability to rinse it all away. Water temperature can also play a role. Cold water might not be as effective at loosening hair from clothes as warm or hot water. The hair then remains in the washing machine rather than getting flushed out. Understanding these factors helps you choose the right cleaning methods.

## Pre-Treatment Strategies: Stop Pet Hair Before It Enters the Washer

The best way to remove pet hair from a washing machine is to prevent it from getting there in the first place. Pre-treating your clothes is a crucial first step. I always try to remove as much pet hair as possible from garments before they even touch the washing machine. This significantly reduces the amount of hair that ends up inside your appliance. It also helps your clothes come out cleaner.

One simple yet effective method involves using a dryer. Before washing heavily furred items, put them in the dryer on a cool or no-heat cycle for about 10-15 minutes. Add a dryer sheet or two. The tumbling action and static cling generated in the dryer often loosen and collect a surprising amount of hair in the lint trap. After this initial tumble, remember to clean the lint trap thoroughly. You will be amazed at how much hair you collect. This prevents the hair from entering your washing machine and potentially clogging its system.

Another effective tool is a lint roller. Before loading clothes into the washer, go over them with a sticky lint roller. This works particularly well for visible clumps of hair. You can also use a damp rubber glove. Put on a rubber glove, dampen it slightly, and rub your hands over the fabric. The pet hair will stick to the damp rubber, forming clumps that you can easily pick off and discard. This method is very efficient for larger surfaces like blankets or pet beds.

For smaller items or more embedded hair, consider a stiff brush or a specialized pet hair removal brush. These brushes are designed to lift hair from fabric surfaces. Brush the items over a trash can to catch the dislodged hair. You can also give clothes a good shake outdoors. This helps dislodge loose hair before it goes into the wash. Taking these few minutes for pre-treatment saves you a lot of effort later. It keeps your washing machine much cleaner.

## Deep Cleaning the Washing Machine Drum and Gasket

Even with thorough pre-treatment, some pet hair will inevitably end up in your washing machine. Regular deep cleaning of the drum and gasket is essential to prevent build-up. These parts are primary collection points for hair, lint, and grime. A clean drum ensures your clothes get truly clean. It also extends the life of your appliance.

For front-loading washing machines, the rubber gasket around the door is a notorious trap for pet hair. After each wash, open the door and pull back the folds of the gasket. You will likely find a collection of hair, lint, and even small items. Use a damp cloth or paper towel to wipe this area thoroughly. Pay close attention to all the crevices. If the hair is wet and sticky, a dry cloth might pick it up better initially. Then, follow with a damp cloth. For stubborn residue, you can use a spray bottle with a mixture of equal parts water and white vinegar. Spray the gasket, let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe clean. This also helps with any mildew growth.

Top-loading machines do not have a prominent gasket. However, hair can stick to the inner walls of the drum and around the agitator (if it has one). After a cycle, visually inspect the drum. Use a damp cloth or a sponge to wipe down the inside surfaces. Pay attention to the area around the base of the agitator. Hair can collect here. If your top-loader has a removable agitator or pulsator, carefully lift it according to your machine's manual. Clean underneath it. This area can hide a surprising amount of hair and grime. Our guide on [how to clean washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine) offers more general cleaning tips for your appliance.

For a thorough drum cleaning, regardless of machine type, run a hot wash cycle with a cleaning agent. This helps dislodge any hair or residue clinging to the drum walls. You can use a washing machine cleaner tablet, or a natural alternative. Pour two cups of white vinegar directly into the detergent dispenser or drum. Then, run an empty hot water cycle on the longest setting. If you prefer to use bleach, add half a cup of bleach to the dispenser instead. Never mix bleach and vinegar, as it creates toxic fumes. This process helps sanitize the drum and flush out accumulated hair. For detailed steps on using bleach, refer to our article on [how to clean a washing machine with bleach](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-washing-machine-with-bleach).

## Cleaning the Washing Machine Filter and Drain Pump

The washing machine filter and drain pump are critical components for removing debris, including pet hair, from your laundry water. If these parts become clogged with hair, your machine cannot drain effectively. This can lead to hair redepositing on clothes or even machine malfunctions. Cleaning them regularly is a vital step in pet hair removal and machine maintenance. I learned this the hard way when my machine started draining slowly.

Most modern washing machines, especially front-loaders, have a drain pump filter. This filter is designed to catch lint, hair, and small objects before they reach the pump. The location varies by model. You usually find it at the bottom front of the machine, behind a small access panel. Consult your washing machine's user manual to locate it precisely. Before opening the filter, place a shallow pan or towels underneath. Some residual water will drain out. Twist the cap slowly to release the water.

Once the water has drained, completely unscrew the filter. You will often find a shocking amount of lint, hair, and sometimes even coins or buttons. Remove all visible debris by hand. You might need a brush or old toothbrush to clean stubborn gunk from the filter's mesh. Rinse the filter under running water until it is completely clean. Also, look into the filter housing. Use a flashlight to check for any hair or blockages inside. You might need to reach in with your fingers or a pair of pliers to pull out any deep-seated hair clumps.

The drain pump itself is usually behind the filter. While you may not need to clean the pump directly unless there's a severe blockage, cleaning the filter helps protect it. If you suspect a deeper clog in your drain system, it might be time for more involved maintenance. Our guide on [how to clean drain in washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-drain-in-washing-machine) provides detailed instructions on how to clear potential blockages beyond just the filter. Regularly checking and cleaning this filter, perhaps once a month for pet owners, prevents major hair build-up and keeps your machine running smoothly. It ensures pet hair does not recirculate back onto your clean laundry.

## Running a Self-Clean Cycle and Post-Wash Care

After you have manually cleaned the accessible parts of your washing machine, running a self-clean cycle is the next crucial step. This cycle helps to flush out any remaining pet hair, detergent residue, and general grime from areas you cannot reach. It circulates hot water and a cleaning agent through the entire system. This deep cleaning is vital for both hygiene and machine performance. I make sure to do this regularly to keep my machine fresh and efficient.

Many washing machines come with a dedicated "Tub Clean," "Sanitize," or "Self-Clean" cycle. If your machine has this feature, refer to your manual for specific instructions. Generally, you run this cycle empty, meaning no clothes should be inside. Some machines might require a specific cleaning tablet, which you can purchase. These tablets dissolve and clean the internal components. They are designed to break down residue, including pet hair, that might be clinging to the drum or hoses.

If your washing machine does not have a specialized self-clean cycle, you can create your own effective cleaning routine. Start by setting your machine to the hottest water setting available. Choose the largest load size or deepest fill option. Then, add a powerful cleaning agent. White vinegar is a popular and natural choice. Pour two cups of distilled white vinegar directly into the detergent dispenser or directly into the drum. Let the machine fill with water and agitate for a few minutes. Then, pause the cycle and let the vinegar solution soak for at least an hour. This soaking time allows the vinegar to break down stubborn hair, lint, and mineral deposits. After soaking, resume the cycle and let it complete.

Alternatively, you can use bleach for a powerful disinfecting clean. Add half a cup of liquid chlorine bleach to the bleach dispenser. Then, run a hot water cycle without clothes. Remember, never mix bleach and vinegar. After the cycle finishes, wipe down the inside of the drum with a clean cloth. Pay attention to any remaining residue. To prevent mold and mildew, which can trap hair, always leave the washing machine door slightly ajar after each use. This allows air to circulate and the interior to dry completely.

## Preventative Measures: Keeping Your Washer Hair-Free

Removing pet hair from your washing machine is one thing, but preventing its accumulation in the first place is even better. Implementing a few simple preventative measures can save you a lot of cleaning effort down the line. Consistent habits make a big difference in keeping your appliance and laundry free from persistent pet hair. I have found that a little effort upfront saves a lot of hassle later.

One of the most effective preventative strategies is to wash pet-related items separately. Blankets, pet beds, and towels used for grooming tend to hold the most hair. Washing these items in their own load helps contain the hair to that specific cycle. It also prevents the transfer of large amounts of hair to your regular clothes. Before washing these items, shake them vigorously outdoors to dislodge loose hair. This significantly reduces the amount of hair entering your washing machine.

Consider using pet hair catchers or laundry balls specifically designed to attract and collect hair during the wash cycle. These reusable devices, often made of a sticky or textured material, float in the wash water and trap hair and lint. You simply remove them after the cycle and clean off the collected hair. While not foolproof, they can capture a surprising amount of hair that would otherwise stick to your clothes or machine. This is a simple addition to your laundry routine. For more tips on managing pet hair from clothes before it reaches the washer, see our detailed article on [how do you get dog hair out of the washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-do-you-get-dog-hair-out-of-the-washing-machine).

Regular maintenance of your washing machine is also key. After every few loads, especially if you have pets, wipe down the inside of the drum and the door gasket (for front-loaders). This prevents hair from drying and sticking stubbornly to surfaces. Running an empty hot water cycle with vinegar or a dedicated machine cleaner monthly helps flush out internal build-up. Additionally, always remember to clean your dryer's lint trap after every single load. Removing hair from the dryer before it enters the washer (if clothes are put back in for another wash or pre-treatment) is an important step. Keeping the dryer lint trap clear also improves dryer efficiency and reduces fire risk. These consistent actions add up to a cleaner machine and cleaner laundry.

## Troubleshooting Persistent Pet Hair Issues

Despite your best efforts, you might still find pet hair lingering in your washing machine or on your clothes. This can be frustrating. Persistent pet hair issues often point to deeper problems or missed cleaning steps. It is time to troubleshoot systematically. Do not give up yet. There is often a solution.

First, revisit your pre-treatment routine. Are you consistently removing as much hair as possible from clothes before washing? Sometimes, we get busy and skip this step. Recommit to shaking items outdoors, using a lint roller, or running clothes through a dryer on a no-heat cycle first. If your clothes are heavily soiled with hair, a dryer sheet in the dryer cycle can work wonders. Ensure your dryer's lint trap is clean. An overloaded lint trap can cause more hair to stick to clothes.

Next, double-check your washing machine's drain pump filter. This is the most common culprit for persistent hair issues. Hair can sneak past initial cleaning efforts and build up here. Ensure you are not just clearing the visible hair. Reach deep into the housing with a gloved hand to feel for hidden clumps. Sometimes, the filter itself might be damaged, allowing hair to bypass it. If you suspect a deeper clog in the drain hose or pump, beyond the filter, you might need to inspect those parts. You can often access the drain hose from the back of the machine. Disconnecting it and checking for blockages might be necessary. This can be messy, so have towels ready. Our article on [how to clean drain in washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-drain-in-washing-machine) can offer more detailed guidance on this specific area.

Consider the type and amount of detergent you are using. Too much detergent can create excessive suds. These suds can trap hair and prevent it from draining away effectively. This leaves a sticky residue that hair adheres to. Try reducing the amount of detergent you use, especially if you have soft water. Also, ensure your water temperature is appropriate. Cold water may not always be sufficient to loosen and rinse away pet hair. Try washing heavily haired items on a warm or hot cycle when safe for the fabric.

Finally, if all else fails, the issue might require professional attention. A technician can inspect the internal hoses, pump, and other components for deep-seated clogs that are inaccessible to a DIY cleaning. Sometimes, a machine's parts can wear out or become less efficient at flushing out debris. Do not hesitate to call a qualified appliance repair person if you have tried everything and still experience significant pet hair problems. It ensures your machine functions correctly and prolongs its lifespan.
