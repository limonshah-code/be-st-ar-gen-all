## Feeding Your 70 Lb Dog: The Right Homemade Food Portions

Giving your beloved 70 lb dog homemade food can be a rewarding experience. You control the ingredients. You can avoid fillers and artificial additives. Many owners want to know **how much homemade dog food to feed a 70 lb dog**. This is a common question. Getting the portion size right is very important. Too little food can cause nutrient deficiencies. Too much can lead to weight gain.

We will explore key factors affecting your dog's dietary needs. We will discuss calculating calorie requirements. We will look at practical serving sizes. You will also learn about monitoring your dog's health. This article helps you make informed choices for your 70 lb companion. We aim to guide you toward a healthy, balanced homemade diet.

### Takeaway

Feeding a 70 lb dog homemade food requires careful planning. Here are the key points:

*   **Calculate Calories:** Determine your dog's daily calorie needs based on age, activity, and health.
*   **Balance Nutrients:** Ensure the diet has proper protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.
*   **Start with Guidelines:** Begin with general portion recommendations, then adjust.
*   **Monitor Health:** Regularly check your dog's weight, energy, and stool. Adjust food as needed.
*   **Consult a Professional:** Talk to a vet or a board-certified veterinary nutritionist for personalized advice.

For a 70 lb dog, you will generally feed between 900 to 1,800 calories per day of homemade food, divided into two meals. This often translates to about 3.5 to 7 cups of homemade food daily, depending on the food's specific caloric density and your dog's activity level. Always adjust based on your dog's body condition and energy.

## Understanding Calorie Needs for a 70 Lb Dog

Every dog needs a specific amount of calories each day. This calorie count supports their basic body functions. It also provides energy for daily activities. For a 70 lb dog, this number can vary widely. It depends on several factors.

First, consider the dog's Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This is the energy needed to simply exist. Then, we add their daily activities. This gives us their Resting Energy Requirement (RER). Vets use formulas to calculate these needs. A common formula for RER is: RER in kcals/day = 70 x (body weight in kg)^0.75. For a 70 lb dog, that is about 31.75 kg. So, RER = 70 x (31.75)^0.75, which is roughly 1000 calories.

However, dogs are not just resting. Their daily calorie requirement (DER) is RER multiplied by a specific factor. This factor depends on their activity level and life stage. An inactive or senior 70 lb dog might need 1.2 to 1.4 times their RER. An active dog could need 1.6 to 1.8 times. A very active working dog might need 2.0 or even 3.0 times their RER.

For example, a moderately active 70 lb dog (RER ~1000 calories) might need 1.6 x 1000 = 1600 calories per day. This means a wide range exists. It is important to know the calorie content of your homemade ingredients. This helps you calculate accurate portions. If you are comparing homemade food to commercial options, it helps to understand [how many calories are in 1 cup of dry dog food](https://beacleaner.com/how-many-calories-are-in-1-cup-of-dry-dog-food) as a benchmark. Every ingredient has different calorie values. For instance, a cup of cooked chicken is different from a cup of cooked rice.

## Factors Influencing Homemade Dog Food Portions for a 70 Lb Dog

Determining the right amount of homemade food for your 70 lb dog is not a one-size-fits-all situation. Many factors play a role in how much food your dog truly needs. Ignoring these factors can lead to an unbalanced diet or unhealthy weight. Paying attention helps you tailor the food perfectly.

### Activity Level

A dog's activity level is a major factor. A 70 lb dog who spends most of the day lounging on the couch will need fewer calories. This is true compared to a 70 lb dog who runs several miles daily. Active dogs burn more energy. They need more food to fuel their muscles and maintain their weight. Consider walks, playtime, and specific dog sports. A highly active working breed will always need more.

### Age and Life Stage

A puppy has different nutritional demands than an adult or a senior dog. A 70 lb puppy, still growing, needs more calories and nutrients per pound of body weight. They are building bones, muscles, and organs. Adult dogs need food for maintenance. Senior dogs often have slower metabolisms. They may also have reduced activity. This means they usually need fewer calories to avoid weight gain. However, some senior dogs might need more easily digestible nutrients.

### Health Conditions and Metabolism

Underlying health conditions can significantly affect food needs. Dogs with certain illnesses might need special diets. For example, a dog with kidney disease needs controlled protein. Dogs with thyroid issues might have slower metabolisms. This affects their calorie requirements. Allergies also play a role. If you suspect [how do I know if my dog is allergic to his food](https://beacleaner.com/how-do-i-know-if-my-dog-is-allergic-to-his-food), you must adjust ingredients. Spayed or neutered dogs also often have lower caloric needs. Their metabolism can slow down post-surgery. Always consider your dog's individual health status.

### Body Condition Score

The body condition score (BCS) is a visual and hands-on assessment. It tells you if your dog is at an ideal weight. A dog with an ideal BCS has easily palpable ribs. They should have a clear waist when viewed from above. They should also have an abdominal tuck from the side. A BCS of 4 or 5 on a 9-point scale is ideal. If your dog is too thin, you might need to increase food. If they are overweight, you need to decrease it. Regular BCS checks help fine-tune portions.

## Crafting a Balanced Homemade Diet for Your 70 Lb Dog

Creating a balanced homemade diet for a 70 lb dog is more than just mixing ingredients. It requires careful attention to nutrient ratios. Dogs need a specific mix of macronutrients and micronutrients. These ensure proper body function and long-term health. A homemade diet can be excellent. However, it must be complete and balanced.

Macronutrients include protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Protein is crucial for muscle development and repair. Good sources for dogs include lean meats like chicken, turkey, beef, and fish. Fat provides concentrated energy and helps absorb fat-soluble vitamins. Healthy fats come from sources like salmon oil, flaxseed oil, or animal fats. Carbohydrates offer quick energy and fiber. Sources include rice, oats, sweet potatoes, and various vegetables. It's not advisable to feed your dog [what happens if I feed my dog chicken and rice every day](https://beacleaner.com/what-happens-if-i-feed-my-dog-chicken-and-rice-every-day) long-term as it lacks essential nutrients.

Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. These are vital for all bodily processes. A homemade diet often needs supplements to ensure adequacy. These can include a broad-spectrum vitamin-mineral supplement formulated for dogs. You might also add specific nutrients like calcium, phosphorus, zinc, and vitamins A, D, and E. Organ meats like liver are packed with nutrients. They should be included in small amounts.

Common ingredients for a 70 lb dog's homemade diet often include:
*   **Lean protein:** Cooked chicken breast, ground turkey, lean beef, fish (sardines, salmon).
*   **Complex carbohydrates:** Brown rice, oats, quinoa, sweet potatoes, pumpkin.
*   **Vegetables:** Green beans, carrots, broccoli, spinach (avoid onions, garlic).
*   **Healthy fats:** Fish oil, flaxseed oil, or small amounts of animal fat.
*   **Supplements:** A veterinary-approved vitamin and mineral blend. This is critical for preventing deficiencies.

A common mistake is simply feeding human leftovers. This usually lacks balance. It can lead to nutrient deficiencies over time. For example, a diet too high in phosphorus without enough calcium can cause bone problems. This is especially true for large breeds like a 70 lb dog. Always use recipes formulated by a veterinary nutritionist. This ensures your dog gets everything they need.

## Practical Homemade Dog Food Serving Sizes for a 70 Lb Dog

Once you understand your 70 lb dog's calorie needs, you need to convert that into actual food portions. This is where the practical aspect comes in. Homemade food varies greatly in density and moisture. This means specific cup measurements can differ from one recipe to another. Always know the calorie count per cup or gram of your specific homemade batch.

A general starting point for a moderately active 70 lb dog is often between 3.5 to 7 cups of homemade food per day. This amount can be split into two meals. Many owners choose morning and evening feedings. This helps with digestion and keeps hunger at bay. For example, you might feed 2-3 cups in the morning and 2-3 cups in the evening.

To measure accurately, use kitchen scales. Weighing ingredients is more precise than using measuring cups. This ensures consistent portion sizes. If your homemade food is wet and dense, a cup will weigh more. If it is drier and lighter, a cup will weigh less. Calorie density is key. For example, a recipe heavy in lean protein and vegetables will have fewer calories per cup than one rich in grains and fats.

You can calculate the calories per cup for your specific recipe. First, determine the total calories in a batch. Then, divide by the total number of cups in that batch. This gives you the calories per cup. For example, if a batch has 3000 calories and makes 10 cups, then each cup is 300 calories. If your 70 lb dog needs 1500 calories, they would eat 5 cups per day.

Many dog owners wonder [how many cups of homemade dog food should my dog get](https://beacleaner.com/how-many-cups-of-homemade-dog-food-should-my-dog-get) generally. While charts provide estimates, personalized calculation is best.
Consider the consistency of your food too. Some homemade diets are more like stews. Others are drier and crumbly. This impacts how it packs into a cup. Consistency helps with digestion for your dog. It also helps you measure food consistently. Always ensure consistent preparation of each batch. This makes feeding consistent.

## Monitoring Your 70 Lb Dog's Health and Adjusting Food Intake

Feeding homemade food is not a static process. Your 70 lb dog's needs can change over time. It is important to actively monitor their health. This helps you know if the food portions are correct. Regular observation allows you to make timely adjustments.

Start by observing your dog's body condition. Look for a healthy waistline. Their ribs should be easy to feel, but not seen. Their energy levels are also a good indicator. A well-fed dog will be playful and energetic. A dog that is too tired might not be getting enough calories. A dog that is lethargic might be getting too many.

Check their coat condition and skin. A shiny, healthy coat often indicates good nutrition. Dry, flaky skin or a dull coat can signal deficiencies. Pay attention to their stool quality. Firm, well-formed stools are a sign of good digestion. Loose stools or constipation can mean something is off with the diet. This could be portion size or ingredient balance.

Weigh your 70 lb dog regularly. Once a month is a good frequency. Track their weight. If they are consistently losing weight, you might need to increase food. If they are gaining weight, you might need to decrease it. Make changes gradually. Small adjustments are better than big ones. Change the portion by about 5-10% at a time. Then, observe for a week or two.

Do not hesitate to consult your veterinarian. They can help assess your dog's body condition. They can also offer guidance on specific calorie needs. A board-certified veterinary nutritionist can provide custom homemade diet recipes. They ensure complete nutritional balance for your 70 lb dog. They can help if your dog has specific health concerns. Their expertise helps you fine-tune the diet for optimal health.

## Transitioning and Storing Homemade Dog Food Safely

Transitioning your 70 lb dog to homemade food needs a careful approach. A sudden change can upset their stomach. This can lead to diarrhea or vomiting. Introduce the new food slowly over several days. This allows your dog's digestive system to adapt. It also helps you observe any sensitivities.

Start by mixing a small amount of the new homemade food with their current food. For example, replace 10-20% of their old food with homemade food. Do this for a few days. If your dog handles it well, gradually increase the homemade portion. Over 7 to 10 days, slowly reduce the old food. By the end of this period, your dog should be eating 100% homemade food. Watch for any signs of digestive upset during this time. Slow transitions are key for large dogs like a 70 lb dog.

Proper storage of homemade dog food is essential for safety. Homemade food lacks the preservatives found in commercial kibble. This means it spoils faster. Prepare food in batches. This saves time. Cooked homemade dog food can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Use airtight containers. This prevents spoilage and maintains freshness. It is similar to how you would store human leftovers.

For longer storage, freezing is your best option. Portion out the food into daily or meal-sized servings before freezing. This makes it easy to thaw only what you need. You can use freezer-safe bags or containers. Label them with the date. Homemade dog food can be stored in the freezer for up to 2-3 months. Always thaw frozen food in the refrigerator overnight before serving. Do not thaw at room temperature. This can promote bacterial growth. If you are used to how [how long does an open can of wet dog food last in the fridge](https://beacleaner.com/how-long-does-an-open-can-of-wet-dog-food-last-in-the-fridge), remember homemade food might be even more sensitive to temperature and time.

Always practice good food hygiene. Wash your hands, utensils, and surfaces when preparing homemade food. This prevents contamination. Ensure all ingredients are fresh and safe for canine consumption. Avoid ingredients toxic to dogs. These include onions, garlic, chocolate, and grapes. Safe preparation and storage practices ensure your 70 lb dog enjoys healthy, fresh homemade meals.

## Common Mistakes When Feeding Homemade Dog Food to a 70 Lb Dog

While feeding homemade dog food offers many benefits, some common pitfalls can arise. Avoiding these mistakes ensures your 70 lb dog receives the best possible nutrition. Knowing what to watch out for helps you provide a truly balanced diet.

One major mistake is not balancing nutrients. Many owners focus on protein and a few vegetables. They forget about crucial vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids. This can lead to serious deficiencies over time. For example, a common issue is an improper calcium-to-phosphorus ratio. This can lead to bone problems. Always use a veterinarian-approved recipe. Better yet, consult a board-certified veterinary nutritionist. They can formulate a complete diet.

Another error is overfeeding or underfeeding. It is easy to overestimate or underestimate portions. Using visual cues alone is not enough. Too much food causes weight gain. This leads to health problems like joint issues and diabetes in a 70 lb dog. Too little food causes weight loss and nutrient deficiencies. This reduces energy. Measure ingredients accurately. Use a kitchen scale for precision.

Ignoring individual needs is also a mistake. Every 70 lb dog is unique. Their activity level, age, and health vary. What works for one dog might not work for another. Do not simply copy a recipe from the internet without considering your dog's specific profile. Adjust portions based on their body condition and energy levels.

Lack of variety can be a problem. While a specific recipe might be balanced, rotating protein sources and vegetables can provide a wider range of micronutrients. It also helps prevent food intolerances from developing. However, ensure any new ingredients are introduced slowly. This helps avoid digestive upset.

Not cooking properly is a safety concern. Raw feeding has its proponents, but it carries risks of bacterial contamination. If you choose to cook, ensure meats are cooked thoroughly. This kills harmful bacteria. Avoid feeding cooked bones. They can splinter and cause internal damage.

Finally, not seeking professional advice is a significant mistake. Homemade diets are complex. A general vet might not have deep nutritional expertise. A board-certified veterinary nutritionist has specialized training. They can create a diet plan that is complete and appropriate for your 70 lb dog's specific needs and health status. They can help you avoid common mistakes and ensure your dog thrives.
