WD-40 is a popular household product. Many people know it for loosening rusty bolts. It also works as a lubricant and protects against rust. Its properties can help break down carbon deposits on spark plugs. This makes it a useful tool for this cleaning task. Always use it carefully and as directed.

## Why Spark Plugs Need Cleaning

Spark plugs work in a harsh environment. They face high temperatures and constant combustion byproducts. Fuel burns inside the engine's cylinders. This process leaves behind carbon deposits. These deposits build up on the spark plug's electrode. This buildup can reduce the spark's strength. A weak spark means incomplete combustion.

Different types of fouling affect spark plugs. Carbon fouling happens when too much fuel burns. This creates soot on the plug. Oil fouling occurs when engine oil leaks into the combustion chamber. This leaves an oily residue on the plug. Lead fouling is rare now due to unleaded gasoline. It occurs when lead deposits form.

Dirty spark plugs cause several engine problems. Your car might have trouble starting. It may hesitate when you press the gas pedal. Fuel efficiency often drops significantly. The engine might also misfire. Misfires cause rough idling and engine vibrations. Cleaning helps avoid these issues. Keeping your plugs clean improves overall engine health.

Checking your spark plugs regularly is a good practice. Look for signs of wear or heavy deposits. If you see them, cleaning might be the solution. Sometimes, cleaning lawn mower spark plugs follows a similar process. You can apply the same principles to keep small engines running well.
