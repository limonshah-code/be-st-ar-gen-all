### Hydraulic System Troubleshooting for Scissor Lifts

The hydraulic system is crucial for raising and lowering your JLG scissor lift. Issues here often manifest as slow movement or a complete lack of lift. Diagnosing hydraulic problems requires careful observation and systematic checks. We can identify many problems by checking fluid levels and hoses.

First, check the hydraulic fluid level. Low fluid is a common culprit for poor hydraulic performance. Add the correct type of hydraulic fluid if the level is low. Ensure you do not overfill the reservoir. A leaking hose or cylinder seal will also cause low fluid levels. Look for puddles or wet spots under the machine.

Next, inspect all hydraulic hoses and fittings. Look for any signs of wear, cracks, or leaks. A burst hose will result in immediate loss of hydraulic pressure. Tighten any loose fittings you find. Replace damaged hoses or fittings immediately. Running a lift with a leaking hydraulic system is unsafe.

Check the hydraulic pump. The pump creates the pressure needed for movement. Listen for unusual noises from the pump when trying to operate the lift. A whining sound can indicate low fluid or a failing pump. The lift's filter may also be clogged, restricting fluid flow. Replacing the filter can often restore normal operation. Proper [scissor lift maintenance](https://beacleaner.com/jlg-t350-troubleshooting-manual) includes these regular hydraulic checks.

Both engine and battery performance are vital for JLG scissor lift operation. Electric lifts rely heavily on battery health. Combustion engine lifts depend on a well-maintained engine. Proper checks ensure your lift starts and runs reliably. Neglecting these areas leads to unexpected downtime.

For electric JLG lifts, the battery is the heart of the system. Check battery terminals for cleanliness and tightness. A loose or corroded terminal prevents proper power delivery. Use a battery hydrometer to check the specific gravity of each cell if it is a wet-cell battery. This test reveals a weak or dead cell. Ensure the battery charger is working correctly. It should supply the right voltage and amperage for a full charge. A faulty charger leaves the battery undercharged, reducing run time and overall power.

For combustion engine JLG lifts, ensure the fuel tank has enough clean fuel. Check the engine oil level and condition. Dirty oil can damage engine components. Inspect the air filter; a clogged filter restricts airflow and reduces engine power. Spark plugs should be clean and gapped correctly for proper ignition. Look for any visible leaks around the engine. A well-maintained engine starts easily and runs smoothly. Regular [JLG lift repair](https://beacleaner.com/jlg-t350-troubleshooting-manual) includes these engine and battery checks.

### Safety System Diagnostics and Repair

JLG scissor lifts incorporate numerous safety systems to protect operators. When these systems detect an unsafe condition, they prevent lift operation. Understanding how to diagnose and address safety system faults is crucial. Always prioritize safety when troubleshooting these components.

The emergency stop buttons are critical safety features. There is typically one on the ground control and one on the platform. Ensure both buttons are disengaged (pulled out). Test each button by pushing it in and verifying the lift immediately loses power. If the lift does not stop, the button or its wiring is faulty. Replace defective emergency stop switches immediately.

Tilt sensors prevent operation on slopes exceeding the safe limit. If the lift is on an incline, an alarm sounds, and the lift functions may disable. Move the lift to a level surface. Check the tilt sensor for damage or debris. Some models have a reset button for the tilt sensor. Always operate on firm, level ground.

Guardrail interlocks and gate switches ensure the platform gate is closed before operation. If the gate is open or the switch is faulty, the lift will not move. Check these switches for proper engagement and wiring. Ensure nothing obstructs the gate from closing fully. Overload sensors prevent lifting excessive weight. If overloaded, an alarm sounds, and the lift may not raise. Remove weight until the alarm stops. Adhering to load limits is vital for [JLG safety checks](https://www.beacleaner.com/jlg-t350-troubleshooting-manual) and preventing component damage.
