## Understanding Your Atwood 8535 IV DCLP Furnace

Your Atwood 8535 IV DCLP furnace is a vital appliance in your recreational vehicle. It provides necessary warmth during cold weather. This furnace uses propane as its fuel source. It relies on a direct spark ignition (DSI) system. Understanding how it operates helps with any troubleshooting effort. Knowing the function of each part makes diagnostics simpler.

These furnaces are designed for reliability and efficiency. They are common in many RV models. The DCLP designation indicates "Direct Current, Low Profile." This means the furnace runs on your RV's 12-volt battery system. Its compact design allows for flexible installation within limited RV spaces. Before you begin any Atwood 8535 IV DCLP troubleshooting, a basic understanding of its design will serve you well. We can fix a problem better when we know how the system should work.

### How the DCLP System Works

The DCLP system begins operation when the thermostat calls for heat. This signal tells the furnace circuit board to start its sequence. First, the blower motor activates. It pulls air from the RV and pushes it through the heat exchanger. This initial airflow is crucial for safety. It also prepares the system for ignition.

Once sufficient airflow is established, the sail switch closes. This switch confirms that the blower is moving air. After the sail switch closes, the ignition sequence continues. Propane gas flows to the burner. At the same time, the igniter creates a spark. This spark lights the propane. A flame sensor then detects the flame. This ensures the furnace has successfully ignited. If the flame is not sensed, the system attempts to ignite again. It tries several times before locking out.

### Key Components Explained

Several parts work together in your Atwood 8535 IV DCLP furnace. Each part has a specific job. The **thermostat** controls the furnace operation. It signals when heat is needed. The **blower motor** moves air through the furnace. It is essential for combustion and heat distribution. The **sail switch** ensures proper airflow. It prevents ignition without enough air.

The **igniter/electrode assembly** creates the spark to light the propane. It also acts as the flame sensor. The **limit switch** is a safety device. It monitors the furnace temperature. If the furnace overheats, the limit switch opens. This shuts down the system. The **gas valve** controls the flow of propane to the burner. Finally, the **control circuit board** manages the entire sequence. It processes signals and operates components.

## Initial Checks: The Basics of Furnace Troubleshooting

Before you dive into complex repairs, always start with the basics. Many furnace issues stem from simple problems. These are often overlooked. Checking fundamental elements first saves time and effort. I always begin my troubleshooting here. It is like checking if a lamp is plugged in before replacing the bulb. This section covers the most common initial checks. These steps apply to most RV furnace issues.

We will focus on power supply, propane availability, and thermostat settings. These three areas cause a large percentage of furnace malfunctions. A systematic approach to these checks helps pinpoint the problem quickly. Do not skip these steps, even if you think they are too simple. They often hold the solution.

### Verifying Power Supply

Your Atwood 8535 IV DCLP furnace runs on 12-volt DC power. This power comes from your RV's house batteries. A lack of power is a frequent reason for no furnace operation. First, check your RV's battery voltage. Ensure batteries are charged and healthy. A low battery can cause the furnace to cycle improperly or not start at all. I once had a furnace that would only blow cold air because the battery was too low to sustain the igniter and gas valve operation properly.

Next, inspect the 12-volt fuse for the furnace. This fuse is typically located in your RV’s main power distribution panel. A blown fuse will completely cut power to the furnace. Replace any blown fuses with a fuse of the correct amperage. Never use a higher-rated fuse. This can cause electrical damage or fire. Also, check the circuit breaker for the furnace, if your RV has one dedicated to it. Reset it if it has tripped. Ensure all connections to the furnace are tight and free of corrosion.

### Ensuring Propane Flow

The Atwood 8535 IV DCLP furnace operates on propane. Without adequate propane supply, the furnace cannot ignite. Start by checking the propane tank levels. Make sure your tanks are not empty. I have made this mistake more times than I care to admit. Ensure the propane tank valve is fully open. Sometimes, it is only partially opened. This restricts gas flow.

Next, check the propane regulator. This device reduces tank pressure to a usable level for appliances. A faulty regulator can cause low gas pressure. This prevents the furnace from lighting. You can test other propane appliances, like your stove, to confirm general propane flow. If other appliances work, the issue is more likely with the furnace itself. If no propane appliances work, the problem is with the main tank or regulator. Reset the regulator by closing the tank valve, waiting a few minutes, then slowly reopening it. This can fix a tripped over-pressure device.

### Correct Thermostat Settings

The thermostat tells your furnace what to do. Incorrect settings will prevent your furnace from working. First, ensure your RV thermostat is set to "HEAT" mode. Many RV thermostats have multiple modes like "FAN" or "COOL." Confirm it is not in "FAN" mode, as this will only run the blower without heat.

Then, set the temperature significantly higher than the current RV temperature. This ensures the thermostat sends a clear call for heat. Some digital thermostats have a "furnace" or "gas" setting. Make sure this is also selected if applicable. Check the thermostat's batteries if it is a battery-powered model. Dead batteries prevent the thermostat from communicating with the furnace. A common issue I have seen is simply forgetting to turn the thermostat on. Ensure it is on and functioning correctly.

## Common Furnace Ignition Problems and Solutions

Once you have verified the basics like power, propane, and thermostat, you can focus on specific ignition issues. Many problems with your Atwood 8535 IV DCLP furnace involve its ignition system. The furnace might cycle, and the blower fan might run, but no heat comes out. This usually points to a failure in the ignition sequence. This section will cover the main components involved in getting that flame going.

We will look at the igniter itself, which sparks the gas. We will also examine the sail switch, a critical safety device that ensures airflow before ignition. Finally, we will discuss the limit switch, another safety component that prevents overheating. Troubleshooting these parts often resolves "no heat" scenarios. A systematic approach helps narrow down the cause.

### Igniter and Electrode Issues

The igniter, also called the DSI (Direct Spark Ignition) electrode, has two jobs. It creates the spark that ignites the propane. It also acts as the flame sensor, confirming the flame is present. If your furnace cycles but does not ignite, the igniter is a good place to start. First, turn off all power to the furnace for safety. Access the burner assembly area. This usually involves removing an exterior access panel.

Visually inspect the igniter/electrode. Look for cracks in the ceramic insulator. Check for carbon buildup on the metal rods. Carbon buildup can prevent a strong spark. You can gently clean any carbon with a fine sandpaper or brush. Ensure the gap between the two electrode prongs is correct. This gap is usually 1/8 to 3/16 inch. A bent or improperly spaced electrode will not produce a reliable spark. If the igniter is visibly damaged or corroded, it needs replacement. Sometimes, the wiring to the igniter can be loose or corroded. Make sure connections are secure.

### Sail Switch Inspection

The sail switch is a small, paddle-like switch located in the blower housing. Its purpose is to confirm that the blower fan is moving enough air before the gas valve opens. This is a safety feature. It prevents propane from accumulating without proper ventilation. If the sail switch does not close, the furnace will not ignite. The blower fan will run continuously without ignition. This is a very common issue with RV furnaces.

To inspect the sail switch, you need to access the blower compartment. This often requires removing the furnace cover or unbolting the furnace. Once exposed, visually check the sail switch. Ensure it moves freely. It should not be obstructed by dust, debris, or insulation. A common problem is dust accumulation on the paddle. Gently clean it if needed. Test the switch for continuity using a multimeter. When the blower runs, the sail switch should close, showing continuity. If it remains open, it is faulty and needs replacement. Make sure the wiring to the sail switch is secure.

### Limit Switch Checks

The limit switch is another crucial safety device in your Atwood 8535 IV DCLP furnace. It monitors the temperature inside the heat exchanger. If the temperature exceeds a safe limit, the switch opens. This shuts off the gas supply and turns off the burner. This prevents overheating and potential damage. If your furnace runs for a short time and then shuts off, often with the blower still running, a tripped limit switch could be the cause. This condition is usually called "short cycling."

To check the limit switch, turn off all power to the furnace. Locate the limit switch. It is usually mounted on the heat exchanger. It often has two wires connected to it. Disconnect the wires from the switch. Use a multimeter to test for continuity across its terminals. A good limit switch should show continuity when cool. If it shows open (no continuity) when cool, it is faulty and needs replacement. Remember, a tripped limit switch often indicates an underlying issue. Check for restricted airflow, dirty filters, or blocked vents that could cause overheating. Resolving the root cause is important to prevent repeat issues.

## Blower Motor Issues and Airflow Problems

The blower motor is the heart of your furnace's air circulation system. It serves two main functions. First, it provides combustion air for the burner. Second, it circulates heated air into your RV. If the blower motor fails or has problems, your Atwood 8535 IV DCLP furnace will not operate correctly. You might hear the fan running constantly without heat. Or, the fan might not run at all. These symptoms point directly to blower and airflow related problems.

This section will help you diagnose issues with the blower motor itself. We will also look at common airflow obstructions. Addressing these problems is crucial for both furnace operation and safety. Proper airflow ensures efficient heating and prevents overheating. Always ensure power is off before inspecting any moving parts.

### Blower Motor Diagnostics

If the furnace blower fan does not run, first check for power to the motor. Use a multimeter to confirm 12-volt DC power reaches the motor terminals when the thermostat calls for heat. If there is power but no movement, the motor itself may be bad. Listen for any unusual noises coming from the motor, such as grinding or squealing. These sounds indicate worn bearings. Worn bearings can cause the motor to seize.

Sometimes, the blower wheel can become loose on the motor shaft. This prevents proper air movement. Turn off power and inspect the blower wheel for tightness. Also, check for any debris caught in the fan blades. Debris can impede movement. If the motor hums but does not spin, it may be stuck or have a bad starting capacitor (if applicable to your model). In most RV furnaces, the motor is integrated. Replacement of the entire motor assembly is usually required if it is faulty. Remember, a common cause of fan issues is low battery voltage. The fan motor requires consistent power to operate correctly.

### Airflow Obstructions

Proper airflow is essential for your Atwood 8535 IV DCLP furnace. Obstructions can cause many problems. They can reduce heating efficiency. They can also lead to the furnace overheating and tripping the limit switch. The furnace relies on clear air pathways for both combustion and heat distribution. Regularly inspecting these pathways can prevent issues.

Start by checking the intake and exhaust vents outside your RV. These can become blocked by dirt, leaves, or even insect nests. Clear any debris you find. Inside the RV, inspect the return air vents. These are usually located near the furnace. Dust, pet hair, and other household debris can accumulate here. Clean these vents regularly. Also, check the heat ducts inside your RV. Sometimes, objects can fall into the floor vents. This restricts airflow to living areas. Ensure all ductwork is free of kinks or crushes. A restricted airflow can lead to the blower motor working harder. This causes it to draw more current and potentially overheat. A clean air path means a happy furnace.

## Circuit Board and Electrical Troubleshooting

The control circuit board is the brain of your Atwood 8535 IV DCLP furnace. It manages all operations. It receives signals from the thermostat. It then sends commands to the blower motor, gas valve, and igniter. A faulty circuit board can lead to a variety of symptoms. These include no operation, intermittent operation, or incorrect cycling. Understanding how to diagnose circuit board issues is crucial. It also helps to interpret any fault codes the furnace might display.

Electrical issues can also extend to the wiring and connections throughout the furnace system. Loose or corroded wires can disrupt communication and power flow. This section will guide you through inspecting the circuit board. We will also discuss interpreting fault codes. And we will cover checking electrical connections. Always disconnect power before working on electrical components to ensure your safety.

### Deciphering Fault Codes

Some Atwood furnaces, including variations of the 8535 IV DCLP, may have diagnostic capabilities. These can flash indicator lights or display fault codes. These codes help pinpoint the problem. A common fault code signal is a flashing light on the circuit board itself. The number of flashes often corresponds to a specific issue. For example, three flashes might mean an ignition lockout. Four flashes might indicate a sail switch issue.

Consult your Atwood furnace owner's manual for a specific list of fault codes. If you do not have the manual, look for online resources. Many RV forums and manufacturer websites provide this information. Understanding these codes saves significant troubleshooting time. Once you know the code, you can focus on the specific component or system indicated. Always note the sequence and number of flashes. This helps accurately diagnose the problem. A flashing light tells you where to direct your attention.

### Circuit Board Inspection

If your furnace exhibits strange behavior or no operation, the circuit board might be at fault. First, turn off all power to the furnace. Visually inspect the circuit board. Look for any signs of physical damage. This includes burnt spots, swollen capacitors, or corroded traces. Any of these indicate a faulty board. Burnt smells often accompany board failures.

Check all wire connections to the circuit board. Ensure they are secure and free of corrosion. Sometimes, simply reseating the connectors can resolve intermittent issues. If you suspect the board is faulty and see no obvious damage, testing it can be challenging without specialized tools. Many RV owners choose to replace the circuit board as a troubleshooting step. This is especially true if all other components test good. However, replace it only after ruling out all other simpler causes. A new board is an investment.

### Wiring and Connections

Electrical wiring is critical for furnace operation. All components rely on proper electrical connections. A loose wire or corroded terminal can interrupt the circuit. This prevents the furnace from working. I have spent hours diagnosing problems only to find a single loose wire. This is why checking wiring is a vital step in Atwood 8535 IV DCLP troubleshooting.

Begin by visually inspecting all accessible wiring harnesses. Look for any signs of fraying, cuts, or pinched wires. Trace wires from the thermostat to the circuit board. Trace wires from the circuit board to the igniter, gas valve, and blower motor. Disconnect and re-connect all major electrical connectors. This can clear minor corrosion. Use a continuity tester or multimeter to check for open circuits in suspicious wires. Pay close attention to ground connections. A poor ground connection can cause intermittent operation or no operation at all. Ensure all terminals are clean and tight.

## Advanced Troubleshooting and When to Seek Help

After performing basic checks and addressing common ignition or blower issues, you might still have problems. At this point, it is time for more advanced troubleshooting. This level of diagnosis often involves testing components like the gas valve or inspecting the burner assembly. These tasks can be more complex. They sometimes require specialized tools or a higher comfort level with gas appliances. Always prioritize safety. If you are unsure about any step, seek professional help.

This section covers situations where the furnace ignites but struggles to maintain a flame. We will also discuss general burner issues. Remember, propane is flammable. Work carefully. If you reach a point where you feel uncomfortable or lack the necessary tools, a qualified RV technician is your best resource.

### Gas Valve Testing

The gas valve controls the flow of propane to the burner. If it does not open, propane will not reach the igniter. This prevents ignition. If the valve opens partially, it might lead to a weak flame or incomplete combustion. If your furnace's blower runs and the igniter sparks, but no flame appears, the gas valve might be the culprit.

Testing a gas valve requires caution. Ensure all power to the furnace is off. You can often hear an audible click when the gas valve attempts to open. This happens during the ignition sequence. If you hear no click, the valve might not be getting power, or it is faulty. Use a multimeter to check for 12-volt DC power at the gas valve terminals during the ignition cycle. If power is present but the valve does not open, the valve is likely bad. Do not attempt to repair the gas valve. Gas valves are sealed units and must be replaced if faulty. Always confirm propane supply is robust before testing the valve.

### Burner Assembly Maintenance

The burner assembly is where the propane mixes with air and ignites. Over time, this area can accumulate dirt, dust, or even spider webs. These obstructions interfere with proper combustion. A dirty burner assembly can cause incomplete burning. It can also lead to soot buildup, or even no ignition at all. Regular inspection and cleaning are important.

To inspect the burner, ensure the furnace is off and cool. Remove the access panel to the burner area. Visually inspect the burner tube and orifices. Look for any blockage. Use compressed air or a soft brush to carefully clean any debris. Do not use sharp objects that could damage the orifices. Also, check the flame spreader plate. Ensure it is clean and properly positioned. If the burner orifices are corroded or damaged, they may need replacement. A clean burner ensures efficient and safe operation. This contributes to better overall [Atwood Hydro Flame furnace troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/atwood-hydro-flame-furnace-troubleshooting) as the principles are similar.

### Exhaust System Checks

The exhaust system removes combustion gases from your RV. A blocked or damaged exhaust system is a serious safety hazard. It can cause carbon monoxide to enter your living space. It can also prevent the furnace from operating correctly. Many furnaces have pressure switches or sensors that detect proper exhaust flow. If blocked, the furnace will not run.

Inspect the exterior exhaust vent. Look for any signs of blockage from nests, debris, or rust. Clear any obstructions. Ensure the exhaust pipe is securely connected and not corroded. Also, check the combustion air intake. This is usually adjacent to the exhaust vent. It supplies fresh air for combustion. Blockages here can also prevent ignition. Regularly clean both the intake and exhaust vents to ensure proper furnace operation and safety. If you smell exhaust inside your RV, or if your carbon monoxide detector alarms, immediately turn off the furnace and ventilate your RV. Do not use the furnace until a professional inspects and repairs the exhaust system.

## Preventive Maintenance for Your Atwood Furnace

Regular maintenance is key to keeping your Atwood 8535 IV DCLP furnace running smoothly. It helps prevent many common issues before they start. Just like your RV engine, your furnace needs periodic care. Proactive maintenance saves you time, money, and discomfort in the long run. I have found that a little effort upfront avoids major headaches later.

This section outlines simple, routine maintenance tasks. These tasks can extend the life of your furnace. They also ensure it operates safely and efficiently. Incorporate these checks into your RV's seasonal maintenance schedule. By following these tips, you reduce the need for extensive Atwood 8535 IV DCLP troubleshooting.

### Cleaning and Inspections

Regular cleaning is fundamental to furnace health. Start by cleaning the exterior exhaust and intake vents. Use a brush or vacuum to remove dirt, leaves, and insect nests. These can restrict airflow. Inside, clean the return air filter or screen. Dust and pet hair accumulate here, hindering air circulation. A clogged filter makes the blower motor work harder.

Inspect the blower motor area. Look for any dust or debris on the blower wheel. A dirty blower wheel reduces airflow efficiency. Use a soft brush or compressed air to clean it. Avoid bending the delicate fan blades. Check the burner assembly for any signs of soot or carbon buildup. Clean it gently if necessary. Also, inspect all electrical connections for tightness and corrosion. Clean any corroded terminals with fine sandpaper or a wire brush. These simple cleanings ensure your furnace breathes properly and makes good connections.

### Seasonal Preparation

Preparing your Atwood 8535 IV DCLP furnace for different seasons is important. Before the heating season begins, perform a thorough operational check. Turn on the furnace and let it run through a full cycle. Listen for any unusual noises. Observe the flame through the viewing port, if available. The flame should be blue with a little yellow at the tips. If it is mostly yellow or orange, it indicates incomplete combustion. This might require professional adjustment.

During periods of non-use, especially during storage, ensure the furnace area is free from pests. Insects and rodents can build nests in the furnace. This causes blockages and damage. Consider covering the exterior vents with screens if you store your RV for long periods. If you winterize your RV, ensure the propane system is properly shut down. This helps prevent leaks or other issues during storage. A well-prepared furnace is a reliable furnace.
