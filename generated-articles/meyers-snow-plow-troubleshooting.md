## Solving Your Meyers Snow Plow Troubles

A heavy snowfall arrives. You need your Meyers snow plow ready. It helps clear driveways and roads quickly. But sometimes, these powerful machines face problems. You might find your Meyers snow plow stuck. This guide helps you diagnose and fix common issues. I want to help you get your plow working again. This article covers hydraulic, electrical, and mechanical Meyers snow plow troubleshooting.

**Takeaway:**
*   Inspect hydraulic fluid levels and condition.
*   Check all electrical connections, fuses, and relays.
*   Listen for unusual motor sounds or lack of operation.
*   Examine plow blade for wear and proper tripping action.
*   Regular maintenance prevents many common plow failures.

When your Meyers snow plow acts up, common fixes involve checking hydraulic fluid levels, inspecting electrical connections for corrosion or breaks, and examining mechanical components for wear or obstruction. Start with the simplest checks first.

### Understanding Meyers Plow Hydraulic Issues

Hydraulic systems make your Meyers snow plow lift and angle. If your plow does not lift, lifts slowly, or drifts down, a hydraulic problem exists. This system relies on fluid pressure to operate. We need to check the basics first.

You should first check the hydraulic fluid reservoir. Look for the fluid level. It should be full when the plow is down. Low fluid causes many problems. Add proper hydraulic fluid if needed. Dirty fluid also causes issues. If the fluid looks dark or milky, it needs changing. This simple step often solves common Meyers plow problems.

Next, inspect hydraulic hoses. Look for leaks, kinks, or damage. A leak means fluid loss and pressure drop. Kinked hoses restrict fluid flow. Tighten any loose fittings. Replace any damaged hoses immediately. This maintains fluid pressure.

#### Common Hydraulic Symptoms and Fixes

*   **Plow Won't Lift:** Check fluid level first. Then, inspect the pump. Listen for the pump motor running. If it runs, but no lift occurs, the pump might be failing. A faulty solenoid valve also causes this. The valve directs fluid. If it sticks open or closed, the plow will not move.
*   **Plow Drifts Down:** This usually points to internal cylinder leaks or a faulty check valve. The check valve holds pressure. If it fails, fluid leaks back. Cylinder seals can also wear out. They then let fluid pass, causing the plow to drop slowly. Replacing seals fixes this.
*   **Slow Plow Movement:** Dirty fluid or a weak pump can slow operation. Ensure the fluid is clean. Test the pump output if possible. A clogged filter also restricts flow. Some Meyers E-47 or E-60 units have filters inside.

Remember to use the correct type of hydraulic fluid for your Meyers plow. Consult your owner's manual for the specific fluid type. Using the wrong fluid can damage seals and components. Proper fluid keeps your system working well.

### Diagnosing Meyers Snow Plow Electrical Problems

Electrical problems can stop your Meyers plow cold. No power means no movement. These issues range from simple to complex. We will start with easy checks. Your plow controller depends on a good electrical connection.

First, check all electrical connections. Look at the battery terminals. They must be clean and tight. Corrosion on battery posts restricts power. Next, follow the main power cable from the battery to the plow's hydraulic unit. Look for any cuts or frayed wires. A damaged wire means no power gets through.

Inspect the fuse block. Meyers plows have several fuses. Each protects a circuit. A blown fuse means too much current flowed through. Replace any blown fuses. Use the correct amperage fuse. An incorrect fuse can cause more damage. A bad relay also stops power. You might hear a click but no action.

#### Common Electrical Symptoms and Fixes

*   **Plow Has No Power:** Check the main power fuse first. It often sits near the battery or on the plow unit itself. Ensure the ground wire connects firmly to the vehicle frame. A poor ground prevents the circuit from completing. Test battery voltage. A low battery cannot power the plow.
*   **Controller Not Responding:** Check the controller's wiring harness. It connects the controller to the plow. Look for bent pins or corrosion in the connectors. A broken wire inside the harness is common. Test the controller itself if possible. Sometimes, the controller unit fails. If you are having trouble with another plow's controller, you might find some similar tips in our [Sno-Way Plow Controller Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/sno-way-plow-controller-troubleshooting) guide.
*   **Intermittent Operation:** This often points to a loose connection or a failing relay. Wiggle wires gently to see if the plow responds. Clean all wire terminals. Relays can become weak over time. Replace suspicious relays. This ensures steady power flow.

Always disconnect the battery before working on electrical components. This prevents accidental shorts or shocks. Use a multimeter to test for continuity and voltage. This helps pinpoint exact electrical failures.

### Troubleshooting the Plow Motor and Pump Unit

The motor and pump unit are the heart of your Meyers plow's hydraulic system. The motor drives the pump. The pump creates hydraulic pressure. If the motor runs, but the plow does not move, the problem is likely the pump or the associated valves. If the motor does not run, the issue is electrical or the motor itself.

Listen for the motor sound. When you press a button, you should hear a hum or whir. If you hear nothing, check the electrical path to the motor. Ensure the motor's ground wire is secure. A common issue is a faulty motor solenoid. The solenoid acts as a large switch. It sends high current to the motor. If it clicks but the motor does not turn, the solenoid might be bad. You can sometimes jump the solenoid to test the motor directly.

If the motor runs but the plow doesn't move, the pump is the likely culprit. The pump might be worn out. It might not build enough pressure. Internal pump damage can cause this. Low or dirty hydraulic fluid also damages the pump. Ensure the fluid is clean and at the correct level. A clogged hydraulic filter, if present, also restricts pump function.

#### Motor and Pump Diagnostic Steps

*   **Motor Does Not Run:**
    *   **Check Power:** Use a test light or multimeter. See if power reaches the motor terminals when activated.
    *   **Inspect Solenoid:** Test the solenoid. Ensure it receives activation power from the controller. Then, check its output terminals for continuity.
    *   **Examine Motor Brushes:** Worn motor brushes prevent the motor from spinning. Some motors allow brush replacement. This can save the motor.
*   **Motor Runs, No Plow Movement:**
    *   **Check Fluid Level:** Again, ensure fluid is full and clean.
    *   **Test Pump Pressure:** This requires a hydraulic pressure gauge. Connect it to a test port. Compare readings to specifications. Low pressure means a failing pump.
    *   **Inspect Relief Valve:** The relief valve prevents over-pressurization. If it sticks open, pressure leaks away. This stops plow movement.
    *   **Check Filters:** If your unit has an internal filter, it may be clogged. Cleaning or replacing it can restore function.

Regularly check connections to the motor and pump. Loose connections cause resistance and poor performance. A well-maintained motor and pump ensure reliable plowing.

### Addressing Plow Angling Issues

Your Meyers snow plow needs to angle correctly. This lets you push snow left or right. Problems with angling can slow down your work. They also make plowing less efficient. Angling issues usually involve hydraulic cylinders or control valves.

First, check the angling cylinders. These are smaller hydraulic cylinders on each side of the blade. Look for fluid leaks around the cylinder seals. Leaking fluid means the cylinder cannot hold pressure. This causes slow or no angling. Also, inspect the cylinder rods. Bent or damaged rods prevent smooth operation.

Next, examine the hydraulic hoses connected to the angling cylinders. Like main lift hoses, these can kink or leak. Ensure they are free from obstruction. A restricted hose will prevent fluid from reaching the cylinder properly. Tighten any loose fittings.

#### Common Angling Problems and Solutions

*   **Plow Won't Angle or Angles One Way:**
    *   **Solenoid Valve Failure:** Angling relies on specific solenoid valves. If one valve fails, the plow might only angle one direction, or not at all. Test the solenoids for power and function. They click when activated.
    *   **Cylinder Failure:** A faulty cylinder on one side will prevent that side from moving. The piston might be stuck. Or the internal seals are bad.
    *   **Blocked Port:** Debris might block a hydraulic port. This stops fluid flow to one side.
*   **Slow Angling:**
    *   **Low Fluid:** As always, check hydraulic fluid. Low fluid affects all hydraulic functions.
    *   **Contaminated Fluid:** Dirty fluid can clog small passages. This slows movement.
    *   **Weak Pump:** A pump not making full pressure affects angling too.
    *   **Binding Pins:** Check the pivot pins where the blade angles. They should move freely. Grease them regularly. Rust or debris can cause binding. If you work on other snow equipment, you might find some relevant carburetor cleaning tips in our [how to clean snow blower carburetor](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-snow-blower-carburetor) guide, which can sometimes impact performance.

Ensure the angling solenoids click when you activate them. If one does not click, it might be dead or not getting power. Replace faulty solenoids. Proper angling makes snow removal easy.

### Resolving Controller and Wiring Harness Failures

The controller is your interface with the Meyers snow plow. The wiring harness connects the controller to the plow's hydraulic unit. Problems here mean you cannot control the plow. These issues often relate to bad connections or damaged wires.

Start by checking the controller's connection to the vehicle. It plugs into an accessory port or directly to the battery. Ensure it receives power. Look at the pins inside the controller's plug. They must be straight and clean. Bent or corroded pins prevent proper communication.

Next, inspect the entire wiring harness. This long cable runs from your vehicle's cab to the plow. It faces harsh conditions. Look for cuts, abrasions, or crushed spots. A damaged wire inside the harness will stop specific functions or all functions. Animal chew marks are also common.

#### Controller and Harness Troubleshooting Steps

*   **Controller Does Not Light Up/No Power:**
    *   **Check Vehicle Power:** Ensure the vehicle's accessory port or battery connection provides power. Check the fuse for that circuit.
    *   **Inspect Controller Plug:** Unplug and re-plug the controller. Look for loose pins or corrosion.
    *   **Test Controller:** If possible, test the controller on another known working plow. Or try a known good controller on your plow. This isolates the problem.
*   **Buttons Unresponsive/Intermittent Function:**
    *   **Wiggle Harness:** Gently flex the wiring harness. If the plow responds, you have a break inside the wire.
    *   **Check Pin Connections:** Inside the plow-side connector, check each pin. They must seat correctly. Corrosion on pins causes poor contact. Use electrical contact cleaner.
    *   **Internal Controller Fault:** Sometimes, the controller itself fails internally. Water intrusion or impact can damage it. If all wiring checks out, replacing the controller is the next step.
*   **Specific Functions Not Working (e.g., only lift, no angle):**
    *   **Verify Controller Output:** The controller sends specific signals for each function. Use a test light to see if the signal leaves the controller.
    *   **Trace Harness Wires:** Follow the specific wire for the non-working function. Look for damage along its path to the solenoid.
    *   **Solenoid Checks:** The controller sends a signal to a specific solenoid. If the wire is good, the solenoid might be faulty.

Properly secure the wiring harness. Keep it away from moving parts and sharp edges. This prevents damage. Regular cleaning of connections extends their life.

### Managing Fluid Leaks and Reservoir Problems

Fluid leaks are a clear sign of a problem with your Meyers snow plow hydraulic system. They reduce fluid levels and pressure. Leaks also make a mess and can be costly if ignored. Addressing them promptly saves money and keeps your plow working.

First, identify the source of the leak. Look for wet spots on hoses, fittings, and around cylinders. Small drips can turn into large puddles. A leak can be from a loose fitting. It could also be from a damaged hose or a worn seal.

The hydraulic reservoir itself can leak. Check for cracks in the plastic or metal tank. The cap seal can also leak if it is old or damaged. A leaking reservoir means constant fluid loss. This needs immediate attention.

#### Leak Detection and Repair

*   **Loose Fittings:** Tighten any fittings that show signs of weeping fluid. Do not overtighten, as this can damage threads. Use a wrench, not pliers.
*   **Damaged Hoses:** Look for cuts, cracks, or bulges in hoses. Hoses can wear from rubbing against parts. Replace damaged hoses. This is a common source of leaks.
*   **Worn Cylinder Seals:** If fluid leaks from around the cylinder rods, the internal seals are bad. Rebuilding the cylinder or replacing it fixes this. This requires disassembly.
*   **Pump or Valve Body Leaks:** Leaks from the pump body or control valve assembly often indicate worn internal seals or gaskets. These repairs are more complex. They might require a professional.
*   **Reservoir Cracks:** Small cracks in plastic reservoirs can sometimes be repaired with specialized epoxy for plastics. For larger cracks or metal tanks, replacement is often the best option. Ensure the reservoir cap seals tightly.

Regularly check your hydraulic fluid level. If it drops consistently, you have a leak. Find it and fix it. This prevents system damage from low fluid. Keep the area around the hydraulic unit clean. This helps you spot leaks faster.

### Handling Blade and Trip Edge Malfunctions

The blade and trip edge components on your Meyers snow plow do important work. The blade pushes snow. The trip edge allows the blade to trip over obstacles. This protects the plow and vehicle. When these parts malfunction, plowing becomes difficult or dangerous.

First, check the cutting edge on the bottom of the blade. It wears down over time. A worn cutting edge means the plow does not clear snow cleanly. It might leave streaks. Replace the cutting edge when it wears thin. This ensures efficient plowing.

Next, inspect the trip springs. These springs hold the blade upright. They allow the blade to pivot forward if it hits an obstacle. If a spring breaks or weakens, the blade might trip too easily. It might also not return to its upright position. This makes plowing very frustrating.

#### Blade and Trip Edge Troubleshooting

*   **Blade Not Clearing Snow:**
    *   **Worn Cutting Edge:** This is the most common reason. Replace the cutting edge.
    *   **Improper Angle:** Ensure the plow is angled correctly to the ground. Adjust the shoes if needed.
    *   **Blade Damage:** A bent or warped blade will not clear snow evenly.
*   **Blade Trips Too Easily:**
    *   **Weak Trip Springs:** Springs lose tension over time. Replace all trip springs at once for even tension.
    *   **Loose Spring Bolts:** Ensure the bolts holding the springs are tight.
    *   **Frozen Pivot Points:** Ice or rust can bind the trip mechanism. Clean and lubricate the pivot points.
*   **Blade Not Returning After Tripping:**
    *   **Broken Trip Springs:** A broken spring means nothing pulls the blade back.
    *   **Seized Pivot Pins:** Rust or lack of lubrication can seize the pivot pins. Clean and grease them.
    *   **Bent Components:** Inspect the trip mechanism for bent parts. They might prevent free movement.

Keep the blade and trip edge areas clean. Remove snow, ice, and debris after each use. Lubricate pivot points regularly. This extends the life of these critical components. An efficient blade saves you time and effort.

### Addressing Mounting and Frame Concerns

The plow mount and frame connect your Meyers snow plow to your vehicle. They absorb stress during plowing. Any issues here affect the plow's stability and performance. Ignoring these problems can lead to damage to your vehicle or plow.

First, check all mounting bolts. These connect the plow frame to your vehicle's frame. They must be tight. Loose bolts cause the plow to wobble. This creates excessive wear on components. Retighten any loose bolts. Use the correct torque specifications.

Next, inspect the plow frame itself. Look for cracks, bends, or severe rust. Plowing puts a lot of force on the frame. Cracks can spread and lead to complete failure. If you find cracks, they need welding or reinforcement. Rust weakens the metal over time.

#### Mounting and Frame Troubleshooting

*   **Plow Wobbles or Sways Excessively:**
    *   **Loose Mounting Bolts:** This is the most common cause. Check and tighten all bolts connecting the plow to the truck mount.
    *   **Worn Pins/Bushings:** The pins and bushings that connect the plow to the truck frame can wear out. This creates play. Replace worn pins and bushings.
    *   **Damaged Truck Mount:** Inspect the truck-side mount for cracks or bends. The vehicle frame itself might be damaged.
*   **Plow Does Not Attach Securely:**
    *   **Bent Mounting Tabs:** The tabs on the plow or truck mount might be bent. This prevents proper alignment.
    *   **Obstructions:** Debris, ice, or rust inside the receiver points can prevent secure attachment. Clean them out.
    *   **Misaligned Frame:** If the vehicle's frame is bent from an impact, the plow might not align.
*   **Unusual Noises During Plowing (Grinding/Clanking):**
    *   **Loose Components:** Listen for where the sound comes from. It could be a loose bolt, a worn pin, or a loose part of the frame.
    *   **Plow Scraping Vehicle:** Ensure the plow clears the vehicle's underside during lifting. Adjust stops if needed.

Periodically inspect your truck's frame as well. This is especially true if you plow often. Heavy plowing can stress the vehicle. Keeping the mounting system sound keeps you safe.

### Winterizing Your Meyers Snow Plow for Storage

Proper winterization prevents many Meyers snow plow problems. It protects your equipment during the off-season. Skipping these steps leads to rust, seized components, and hydraulic failures. I always take the time to prepare my plow for storage.

First, clean your plow thoroughly. Remove all dirt, salt, and snow residue. Salt is very corrosive. Use a pressure washer. Let the plow dry completely. This step prevents rust formation.

Next, inspect all moving parts. Look for wear or damage. Repair anything broken now. It is easier to fix things in warm weather. Lubricate all pivot points and exposed hydraulic rods. Use a good quality grease or penetrating oil.

#### Essential Winterization Steps

*   **Hydraulic System Care:**
    *   **Check Fluid:** Ensure the hydraulic fluid is full and clean. If dirty, consider flushing and replacing it.
    *   **Lower Plow:** Store the plow in the down position. This relieves pressure on the hydraulic system and extends cylinder seal life.
    *   **Clean and Grease Rods:** Extend all hydraulic cylinder rods fully. Wipe them clean. Apply a light coat of grease or dielectric grease to prevent rust. Retract them slightly to pull the grease into the seals.
*   **Electrical System Protection:**
    *   **Disconnect Power:** Unplug the main power harness from the vehicle.
    *   **Clean Connections:** Use electrical contact cleaner on all electrical connectors. Apply dielectric grease to prevent corrosion.
    *   **Store Controller:** Remove the controller from the vehicle. Store it in a dry, safe place indoors.
*   **Blade and Frame Maintenance:**
    *   **Paint Scratches:** Touch up any areas where paint is scratched or worn. This prevents rust. Use rust-inhibiting paint.
    *   **Lubricate Trip Mechanism:** Grease the pivot points for the trip edge.
    *   **Secure Blade:** Ensure the blade is fully down and secured.

Store your Meyers snow plow in a dry, covered area if possible. This protects it from weather elements. If storing outside, cover the hydraulic unit. These steps ensure your plow is ready for the next winter.

### General Maintenance Tips for Longevity

Regular maintenance extends the life of your Meyers snow plow. It also prevents unexpected breakdowns. A small amount of effort now saves you from big headaches later. I make these checks part of my routine.

First, always check your hydraulic fluid level before each use. Low fluid can damage the pump and other components. Use the correct type of fluid specified by Meyers. Clean fluid is essential for smooth operation.

Second, visually inspect all hoses and connections. Look for leaks or signs of wear. Tighten any loose fittings. Replace worn hoses before they burst. This simple check can prevent a major hydraulic failure during a snowstorm.

#### Key Maintenance Practices

*   **Lubrication:**
    *   **Grease Zerk Fittings:** Your plow has several grease zerks on pivot points. Grease them regularly, especially before and during heavy use. This reduces wear and prevents seizing.
    *   **Cylinder Rods:** Keep hydraulic cylinder rods clean and lightly greased. This protects the seals.
*   **Electrical Connections:**
    *   **Clean Terminals:** Keep battery terminals and plow electrical connections clean and free of corrosion. Use battery terminal protector spray.
    *   **Inspect Wiring:** Periodically check the wiring harness for cuts, abrasions, or pinch points. Secure any loose wires.
*   **Blade and Shoes:**
    *   **Check Cutting Edge:** Monitor the wear on your cutting edge. Replace it when it becomes too thin.
    *   **Adjust Shoes:** Adjust the plow shoes to the correct height. They protect the cutting edge and allow the plow to glide over surfaces.
*   **Fasteners:**
    *   **Tighten Bolts:** Regularly check and tighten all bolts and fasteners on the plow, frame, and mounting system. Vibrations loosen them over time.
    *   **Inspect Pins:** Check all pins for wear. Replace bent or severely worn pins.

Following these general maintenance tips ensures your Meyers snow plow remains reliable. You will spend less time troubleshooting and more time plowing.
