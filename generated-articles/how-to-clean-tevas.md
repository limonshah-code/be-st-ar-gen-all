After soaking, take one sandal out. Apply a small amount of soap directly to the dirty areas. Use your brush to scrub all surfaces. Pay special attention to the footbed. This area collects a lot of sweat and dead skin. Scrub the straps, both inside and out. Work on the seams and buckles. The goal is to remove all visible dirt. Rinse the sandal under running water. Ensure all soap is gone. Repeat the process for the second sandal.

### How To Remove Odor From Teva Sandals

Odor is a common problem with worn sandals. Your feet sweat. This creates a moist environment. Bacteria love this environment. They grow and produce bad smells. Even clean Tevas can develop an odor over time. This section focuses on eliminating those unpleasant smells. It brings freshness back to your sandals. You can tackle odor with simple household items.

Baking soda is an excellent odor absorber. First, clean your Tevas as described above. Make sure they are damp, but not soaking wet. Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda over the entire footbed. Also, sprinkle it on the straps. Let the baking soda sit for several hours. Overnight is best. It will draw out moisture. It will absorb the smells. After the time passes, brush off the baking soda.

Then, spray the vinegar solution liberally onto the footbeds and straps. Let it sit for about 15-20 minutes. The vinegar neutralizes odors. It also kills some bacteria. After 20 minutes, rinse your Tevas thoroughly with clean water. Make sure no vinegar smell remains. Vinegar smell goes away when dry. You can also try exposing your clean Tevas to direct sunlight. Sunlight is a natural sanitizer. It helps kill odor-causing bacteria. It also helps dry the sandals completely. Leave them outside for a few hours. This works best after a cleaning session.

### Drying Tevas Correctly: Essential for Longevity

Proper drying is as important as proper cleaning. If you do not dry your Tevas completely, several problems can arise. Moisture can lead to mildew growth. Mildew causes a musty smell. It can also damage the materials over time. Incomplete drying also creates a breeding ground for new odor-causing bacteria. This undoes all your cleaning work. Taking the time to dry Tevas well protects your effort.

Never put your Tevas in a clothes dryer. High heat can warp the EVA foam soles. It can also damage the synthetic webbing. The straps might shrink or become brittle. Always air dry your Tevas. Find a well-ventilated area. Place your Tevas where air can circulate around them. You can hang them by the straps. You can lay them flat on a mesh surface. Avoid direct sunlight for prolonged periods, especially on dark-colored Tevas, as it can fade colors. However, some sunlight for a few hours is fine for odor control.

Allow plenty of time for drying. Depending on humidity, this can take 12 to 24 hours. Check all parts of the sandal. The footbed needs to be fully dry. The straps must be dry to the touch. Pay attention to areas under buckles. These spots trap moisture. If you plan to store your Tevas, ensure they are bone dry. Storing damp sandals encourages mold. Proper drying maintains the shape of your Tevas. It prevents material degradation. It also ensures they are fresh and ready for your next adventure.

### Caring For Teva Materials: Specific Tips

Tevas use different materials. The straps are usually made from recycled polyester webbing. The footbeds are often EVA foam. The outsoles are rubber. Each material benefits from specific care techniques. Knowing these helps you clean without causing damage. It also keeps your Tevas looking good longer. You want to maintain the integrity of each part.

The polyester webbing straps are durable. They resist water. But, dirt and sweat can stain them. When cleaning, use a soft brush. Scrub along the direction of the fibers. This helps lift embedded dirt. Avoid abrasive scrubbers. They can fray the fabric. For tough stains on the webbing, a small amount of laundry stain remover designed for synthetics can work. Test it on a hidden spot first. Always rinse the straps thoroughly. You must remove all cleaning agents. This prevents skin irritation. It also stops soap residue from attracting more dirt.

The EVA foam footbed provides cushioning. It often has a textured surface. This texture can trap a lot of grime. A stiff brush helps here. Scrub the footbed in circular motions. This gets into the grooves. You can use a mild soap solution. For any stubborn dark spots, a baking soda paste works well. Mix baking soda with a little water. Apply it to the spot. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then, scrub and rinse. For the rubber outsoles, a basic scrub brush and soapy water will suffice. The goal is to remove any stuck mud or debris. Proper material care ensures your Tevas remain comfortable and functional.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Tevas

Cleaning Tevas is straightforward. But, some common mistakes can damage your sandals. They can shorten their lifespan. Avoiding these errors ensures your cleaning efforts are effective. It also protects your investment in quality footwear. Knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do.

First, avoid using harsh chemicals. Bleach, strong detergents, or abrasive cleaners can break down the materials. They can strip the protective coatings. They can also fade the colors of your Tevas. Always stick to mild soaps. Dish soap or gentle laundry detergent are good choices. Second, do not machine wash Tevas unless the specific model explicitly says it is safe. Most Tevas are not designed for machine washing. The agitation can damage the straps. It can cause buckles to break. It might also warp the foam. Hand washing is always the safest option for longevity.

This ruins the fit and comfort of your sandals. Always air dry. Do not leave Tevas in direct, intense sunlight for extended periods. This can fade the colors, especially on darker sandals. Finally, do not ignore cleaning. Letting dirt and odor build up makes future cleaning harder. It also allows bacteria to thrive. Regular, gentle cleaning is key to long-term Teva care. These simple avoidances keep your Tevas in good condition.
