## Adhesive Issues: Clogging, Stringing, and Charring

Adhesive problems are very common with Nordson glue machines. The glue itself can cause many operational headaches. Clogging, stringing, and charring are frequent issues. I want to help you understand why these happen and how to fix them. Addressing these adhesive-related problems early improves machine performance significantly.

Clogging occurs when adhesive hardens or builds up inside the system. This blocks the flow of glue. It often happens in nozzles or hoses. Stringing, also known as "angel hair," is when thin strands of glue appear after application. This makes products look unappealing. Charring is perhaps the most serious. It happens when glue overheats and burns. Charred glue turns dark and becomes abrasive. It can damage machine components over time.

### Resolving Clogging Issues

Clogging often happens due to contaminants in the glue or improper temperature. First, check your adhesive supply. Ensure the glue is clean and free of debris. Use high-quality adhesive suitable for your machine. Second, verify the temperature settings. Glue needs to be at the correct temperature to flow properly. If it is too cold, it becomes too viscous and clogs. If it is too hot, it degrades faster and leads to charring, which then causes clogging.

You might need to clean the nozzles and hoses regularly. Disassemble these parts carefully and remove any hardened glue. Sometimes, a full system flush is necessary. Use a recommended cleaning agent or fresh hot melt adhesive to flush the system. This helps clear stubborn blockages. Regular cleaning prevents future clogs. Consider using adhesive filters to catch impurities before they reach critical components.

### Addressing Stringing and Charring

Stringing usually points to incorrect temperature or pressure settings. First, check the glue temperature. If it is too high, the glue becomes too fluid and strings. Reduce the temperature slightly to see if the stringing stops. Second, examine the air pressure at the nozzle. Too much air pressure can cause stringing. Adjust the air pressure down gradually. Ensure the nozzle orifice is not worn out. A worn nozzle can lead to poor cutoff and stringing.

Charring is a sign of overheating. The main cause is often high tank temperature settings. Check your temperature controller. Reduce the temperature if it is set too high for the adhesive type. Another cause is old, stagnant glue in the tank. Glue degrades over time, especially when continuously heated. Regularly drain and refill your glue tank. Do not let adhesive sit in the tank for extended periods, especially during downtime. Proper maintenance reduces adhesive charring and protects your machine components. Remember, you can often clean glue residue from machine parts using appropriate solvents or methods. For example, knowing [how to clean glue off plastic](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-glue-off-plastic) or [how to clean glue residue](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-glue-residue) can be very helpful for maintenance.

## Nozzle and Hose Problems: Flow and Application Failures

Nozzles and hoses are critical parts of any Nordson glue machine. They deliver the adhesive precisely where it needs to go. Problems with these components directly impact glue flow and application quality. I have often found that a simple issue here can cause major production delays. Understanding their common failures helps in quick resolution.

Common nozzle problems include clogging, wear, and incorrect size. A clogged nozzle prevents glue from spraying evenly. A worn nozzle creates a poor glue pattern or drips. Using the wrong nozzle size affects glue bead width. Hoses can suffer from blockages, kinks, or leaks. A blocked hose restricts glue flow. A kinked hose stops flow entirely. Leaking hoses waste adhesive and create safety hazards.

### Diagnosing Nozzle Malfunctions

Start by inspecting the nozzle for visible blockages. Often, charred glue or contaminants build up in the tiny orifice. Remove the nozzle safely when the machine is cool. Clean it thoroughly. You can use a small wire brush or special nozzle cleaning tools. Ensure you do not damage the orifice. If cleaning does not help, the nozzle might be worn. Replace worn nozzles immediately. Using an old nozzle leads to inconsistent application.

Verify the nozzle is the correct type for your adhesive and application. Different adhesives and patterns require specific nozzle types. Check the temperature at the nozzle. If the nozzle is too cold, the glue will not flow. If it is too hot, it can char the glue. Ensure the nozzle heater is working correctly. A malfunctioning heater prevents proper glue melting at the point of application.

### Addressing Hose Issues

Hose problems often relate to temperature, blockages, or physical damage. First, check the hose temperature. Hot melt hoses contain internal heaters. If a hose is cold, the glue inside will solidify, causing a blockage. Test the hose heaters and their electrical connections. A faulty heater needs replacement. Next, inspect the hose for any kinks or sharp bends. These restrict glue flow. Reroute hoses if necessary to avoid kinks.

Look for any signs of glue leaking from the hose. Leaks indicate a rupture or a loose connection. A leaking hose means glue is wasted and creates a mess. This also reduces pressure in the system. Replace damaged hoses immediately. Tighten any loose fittings. Sometimes, a hose can become completely blocked internally with charred adhesive. If flushing does not clear it, replace the hose. Proper Nordson glue machine maintenance includes checking these components regularly. This prevents common application issues.

## Pump and Pressure Control Troubleshooting

The pump is the heart of your Nordson glue machine. It moves the molten adhesive through the system. Pressure control ensures consistent glue delivery. Problems with either the pump or pressure can severely affect glue application. I have seen many production lines stop because of pump failures. Understanding these components helps you diagnose and fix issues efficiently.

A common pump problem is insufficient pressure. This results in weak glue application or no glue flow at all. Another issue is inconsistent pressure, leading to uneven glue beads. Sometimes, the pump might make unusual noises, indicating mechanical wear. Pressure control issues often manifest as fluctuating application rates. The glue might come out too fast or too slow. All these problems point to issues within the pump assembly or its related controls.

### Diagnosing Pump Performance

Start by checking the pump motor. Ensure it is receiving power and spinning correctly. Listen for any grinding or abnormal noises. These suggest bearing wear or internal damage. Verify the pump's prime. Air trapped in the pump can prevent it from building pressure. Follow your Nordson manual for priming procedures. This usually involves bleeding air out of the system.

Next, examine the pump's input and output. Ensure the glue tank supply line to the pump is not restricted. Check the filter before the pump. A clogged filter starves the pump of glue. Also, verify the pump's internal components. Worn gears or pistons reduce pumping efficiency. These parts might need replacement if severely worn. Regular inspection of these internal parts extends pump life.

### Resolving Pressure Control Issues

Pressure control involves both mechanical and electronic components. First, check the pressure regulator. This device maintains steady pressure in the system. Adjust it to the recommended setting for your adhesive and application. A faulty regulator might not hold pressure steady. It might need cleaning or replacement. Look for any visible damage or leaks around the regulator.

Verify the pressure transducer or sensor. This component reads the system pressure and sends feedback to the controller. A faulty sensor gives incorrect readings. This leads to the controller mismanaging the pump output. You might need to calibrate the sensor or replace it if it is defective. Check all electrical connections to the pressure control components. Loose wires can cause intermittent pressure issues. Ensure the system is free of air pockets, as air can cause pressure fluctuations. Consistent pressure is key for accurate glue application. Addressing these issues helps maintain the desired Nordson glue machine output. Cleaning up after any leaks or spills is also important.

Any issues with temperature control or heaters lead to significant problems. I have seen poor bonding and charred glue many times due to incorrect heat. This section helps you understand and fix these common thermal issues.

Common temperature problems include glue not melting, charring, or inconsistent temperature throughout the system. If glue does not melt, it prevents flow. Charring indicates overheating, damaging the adhesive and machine components. Inconsistent temperature results in poor glue application quality. These issues often stem from faulty heaters, sensors, or the temperature controller itself.

### Diagnosing Temperature Issues

Start by checking the temperature readings on the machine's display. Do they match the set points? If not, the issue could be with the heater or sensor. Verify all heaters are receiving power. Nordson glue machines have multiple heaters: tank, hose, and nozzle heaters. Test each heater element individually for continuity. A broken heater will not draw current and will not heat up. Replace any faulty heaters.

Next, check the temperature sensors. Each heated zone has a sensor that sends temperature readings to the controller. A defective sensor gives incorrect readings, causing the system to over or underheat. You can test sensors for resistance values, comparing them to manufacturer specifications. If a sensor is out of range, replace it. Ensure sensors are correctly installed and have good contact with the heated surface. Loose sensors give inaccurate readings.

### Resolving Heater and Controller Malfunctions

If heaters and sensors seem fine, the problem might lie with the temperature controller. The controller processes sensor inputs and activates heaters. A faulty controller might not be able to maintain temperature. It might display error codes or show erratic behavior. If you suspect the controller, consult your machine's manual for diagnostic steps. Sometimes, a reset of the controller can resolve minor glitches.

Ensure all electrical connections to heaters, sensors, and the controller are secure. Loose wiring causes intermittent heating or inaccurate readings. Overcurrent protection, like fuses or circuit breakers, should also be checked. A tripped breaker means an electrical fault exists. Always disconnect power before checking electrical components for safety. Proper temperature control ensures adhesive performance and extends the life of your Nordson glue machine.

I have seen machines completely shut down due to a small electrical fault. Understanding these systems is key to effective troubleshooting.

Common electrical problems include power failures, short circuits, or component malfunctions. A machine might not turn on, or specific parts might not operate. Sensor issues often manifest as incorrect readings, causing the machine to misbehave. For example, a level sensor might show the tank is full when it is empty. This prevents glue from flowing. These problems require careful and systematic diagnosis.

### Diagnosing Electrical Problems

Always start with safety. Disconnect all power before checking electrical components. First, verify the main power supply to the machine. Check wall outlets, power cords, and circuit breakers. A tripped breaker indicates an overload or short circuit. Next, examine internal fuses and relays. Fuses protect circuits from overcurrent. A blown fuse means a circuit received too much power. Replace blown fuses only after identifying the root cause.

Inspect all wiring for visible damage, fraying, or loose connections. A loose wire can cause intermittent operation. Use a multimeter to check for continuity and voltage at various points. Compare readings to your machine's electrical schematics. Look for signs of burning or discoloration on electrical components, which indicate overheating. Identifying faulty components like contactors, switches, or motors might require specialized knowledge.

### Resolving Sensor Malfunctions

Sensors provide crucial feedback to the machine's controller. They monitor temperature, pressure, glue level, and more. If a sensor fails, the machine cannot make informed decisions. First, check the sensor's physical connection. Ensure it is clean and properly seated. Dirt or adhesive buildup on a sensor can interfere with its readings. Clean optical sensors carefully.

Test the sensor's output signal. Some sensors provide a simple on/off signal, while others output a variable voltage or current. Use a multimeter to check the signal. Compare it to the expected output in your machine's manual. If the sensor is not sending the correct signal, it needs replacement. Sometimes, recalibration can fix minor sensor inaccuracies. Always consult the Nordson manual for specific calibration procedures. Proper electrical and sensor diagnostics are vital for maintaining the accuracy and safety of your Nordson hot melt system.
