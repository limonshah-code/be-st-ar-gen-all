    *   **Cat Litter:** Clay-based cat litter is excellent for absorbing liquids. Pour a thick layer directly onto the spill.
    *   **Sawdust:** If you have sawdust from woodworking, it also works well as an absorbent. Spread it evenly over the gasoline.
    *   **Sand:** Play sand or building sand can absorb spills effectively. Ensure it is dry for best results.
    *   **Commercial Absorbents:** Auto parts stores sell specialized absorbent materials designed for fuel spills. These often work faster and absorb more liquid.
*   **Apply the Absorbent:**
    *   Pour or sprinkle the chosen material directly onto the spill.
    *   Start from the outer edges and work inwards to prevent the spill from spreading.
    *   Use enough material to cover the entire wet area completely.
*   **Allow Adequate Soaking Time:**
    *   Let the absorbent sit for at least 30 minutes to an hour.
    *   For larger spills, allow several hours or even overnight for full absorption.
    *   The material should turn dark and clump as it absorbs the gasoline.
*   **Remove the Saturated Material:**
    *   Carefully scoop up the saturated absorbent material using a dustpan and stiff brush.
    *   Place all contaminated materials into a heavy-duty plastic bag.
    *   Tie the bag securely to prevent leaks and contain fumes.

    *   Trisodium Phosphate (TSP) is also an effective heavy-duty cleaner for concrete. Mix 1/2 cup TSP per gallon of hot water.
    *   Heavy-duty dish soap can also work for smaller, fresher spills.
*   **Apply and Scrub:**
    *   Pour the cleaning solution directly onto the stained area.
    *   Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, allowing it to penetrate the concrete.
    *   Use a stiff-bristled brush or a push broom to scrub the area vigorously. This helps lift the absorbed gasoline.
    *   For general maintenance of your garage floor, see our guide on [how to clean garage concrete floor](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-garage-concrete-floor).
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:**
    *   Use a garden hose to rinse the cleaned area with clean water.
    *   Direct the water towards a floor drain, if available, or outside away from storm drains.
    *   Avoid letting the contaminated water spread to other areas.
*   **Repeat if Necessary:**
    *   For stubborn stains or strong odors, repeat the cleaning process.
    *   Multiple applications might be needed to fully remove all residue.
    *   If you encounter tough spots, similar methods for [how to clean oil off garage floor](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-oil-off-garage-floor) can be helpful.

### Cleaning Epoxy or Painted Garage Floors

Epoxy or painted garage floors offer a smoother, less porous surface. This makes cleanup easier but requires gentler cleaning agents. Harsh chemicals can damage the coating. You want to preserve your floor's finish while removing the gasoline.

*   **Choose Mild Cleaners:**
    *   Use a mild degreaser or a solution of warm water and dish soap.
    *   Avoid abrasive cleaners, wire brushes, or highly acidic/alkaline products.
