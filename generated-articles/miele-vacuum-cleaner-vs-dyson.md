### Suction Power and Cleaning Performance: Miele vs Dyson

When you consider a new vacuum, suction power is often the first thing on your mind. Both Miele and Dyson boast impressive cleaning abilities. However, they approach performance differently. Miele vacuums, especially their canister models, maintain constant airflow. This ensures deep cleaning across many surfaces. Their powerful motors and sealed systems provide consistent suction from start to finish.

#### Deep Cleaning on Carpets

Miele vacuums often include electrobrushes for carpets. These brushes spin rapidly. They agitate carpet fibers. This helps lift embedded dirt and pet hair. Many Miele models have adjustable brush height settings. This feature optimizes cleaning across various carpet pile lengths.
