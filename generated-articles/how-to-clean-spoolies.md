Then, reshape the bristles and let the spoolie air dry completely before you store it. This simple process removes bacteria and old product, keeping your tools hygienic.

### Why Clean Your Spoolies? Health and Performance First

Your spoolie touches your eyes and eyebrows every day. It picks up makeup, skin oils, and dead skin cells. Over time, these things build up on the bristles. This creates a breeding ground for germs. Using a dirty spoolie can spread bacteria to your eyes. This might cause infections like pink eye or styes. Your health is important. Keeping tools clean keeps you safe.

A dirty spoolie also harms your makeup application. When bristles are caked with old mascara, they cannot separate your lashes well. This leads to clumpy lashes. For eyebrows, dirty brushes cannot comb hairs smoothly. They might leave streaks or pull at the brow hairs. Clean tools work better. They help you achieve a polished look.

Cleaning your spoolies also makes them last longer. Product buildup can stiffen the bristles. This makes them less effective. Regular cleaning keeps the bristles soft and flexible. It helps your spoolies perform as they should. Think of it like washing your clothes. You clean them to keep them nice. You should do the same for your beauty tools. This simple act of hygiene prevents problems. You can learn more about general cleaning practices to keep everything clean around your home.

### Gather Your Cleaning Supplies: What You Need

Before you start cleaning your spoolies, get your supplies ready. Having everything at hand makes the process smoother. You do not need many fancy items. Basic household products often work well. Some specialized items can also make the job easier. Choosing the right cleanser is important for gentle care.

First, you need a cleaning agent. A mild hand soap is often a good choice. Baby shampoo also works very well because it is gentle. You can also use a dedicated makeup brush cleanser. These cleansers are made to break down makeup residue. They are safe for brush bristles. Choose one that suits your needs.

Next, get some water. Lukewarm running water is ideal for rinsing. You also need a small bowl or a clean sink basin. This will hold your cleaning solution or rinse water. Paper towels or a clean cloth are important for drying. They absorb excess water. Remember to have a clean surface ready for drying. Keeping your sink clean helps ensure your tools stay hygienic.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Cleaning Reusable Spoolies

Cleaning your reusable spoolies is a straightforward process. You should clean them often. Weekly cleaning is good if you use them every day. This simple routine keeps them ready for use. It protects your eye health too.

**1. Wet the Bristles:** First, hold your spoolie under lukewarm running water. Let the water run through the bristles. Make sure all bristles are wet. Do not let water get into the ferrule. The ferrule is the metal part that connects the bristles to the handle. Water inside can loosen the glue. This causes bristles to fall out. Keep the spoolie pointed downwards. This lets water run off.

**2. Apply Cleanser:** Put a small amount of your chosen cleanser into the palm of your hand. You can also put it on a textured cleaning mat. Gently swirl the wet spoolie bristles in the cleanser. Work up a gentle lather. You will see old makeup start to come off. Be gentle. Do not press too hard. The goal is to loosen the dirt.

**3. Rinse Thoroughly:** Once you see the makeup coming off, rinse the spoolie under lukewarm running water. Again, keep the spoolie pointed down. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear. This means all the soap and makeup are gone. Squeeze the bristles gently. You can press them against your palm or a clean paper towel. This helps remove excess water.

**4. Reshape and Dry:** After rinsing, gently reshape the spoolie bristles with your fingers. Make sure they point in the correct direction. Lay the clean spoolie flat on a clean paper towel or a dry cloth. Let it air dry completely. Do not stand it upright. This can cause water to collect in the ferrule. It might take several hours for a spoolie to dry. For general cleaning advice around your home, you can find a lot of useful information. Learn how to clean everything effectively to maintain a tidy living space.

### Beyond Basic Cleaning: Deep Sanitizing Spoolies

Sometimes, basic cleaning is not enough. You might want to deep sanitize your spoolies, especially if you have had an eye infection. Deep sanitizing kills more germs. It adds an extra layer of protection. This step is important for hygiene. It protects your eyes from harmful bacteria.

One common way to deep sanitize is using rubbing alcohol. After you clean and rinse your spoolie, dip the bristles into 70% isopropyl alcohol. Do not soak the entire handle. Just dip the bristles for a few seconds. Swirl them gently. The alcohol helps kill bacteria. It also evaporates quickly. This prevents water damage.

You can also use specialized brush sanitizing sprays. These products are made for makeup brushes. They often contain alcohol or other antibacterial agents. Spray the bristles after cleaning. Let them air dry. Always follow the product instructions for best results. These sprays offer a convenient way to sanitize.

Deep sanitizing is not needed every time you clean. Once a month is usually fine for personal use. If you share tools, or if you are a makeup artist, sanitize more often. Sharing beauty tools can spread germs easily. Proper sanitizing stops this. Make sure your tools are dry before you store them. Proper drying is key.

### Drying and Storing Your Spoolies Correctly

Cleaning your spoolies is only half the battle. Proper drying and storage are just as important. If you do not dry them well, moisture can lead to mold and mildew. This can ruin your tools and spread germs. Incorrect storage can also damage bristles or collect dust.

After cleaning and rinsing, gently squeeze any excess water from the spoolie bristles. You can use a clean paper towel for this. Be gentle. Do not pull or twist the bristles. Lay the spoolie flat on a clean, dry towel or paper towel. Make sure it is in a well-ventilated area. Do not stand it upright. Water can seep into the ferrule. This can loosen the glue and damage the brush.

Allow the spoolie to air dry completely. This can take several hours, or even overnight. Make sure there is no dampness left before you put it away. You can tell it is dry when the bristles feel soft and fluffy. They should not feel stiff or damp. Sunlight can help dry faster, but direct heat like a hairdryer can damage bristles. Avoid strong heat.

Once dry, store your spoolies in a clean, dry place. Keep them away from dust and moisture. A brush holder or a clean makeup bag works well. Avoid leaving them exposed on a counter. This can collect dust and airborne germs. Keeping your beauty tools tidy helps maintain a clean bathroom. Learn more about how to keep your entire bathroom clean and organized.

### Common Spoolie Cleaning Mistakes to Avoid

Cleaning spoolies seems simple, but common mistakes can harm your tools or make them less clean. Knowing what to avoid helps you clean your spoolies better. These mistakes can reduce the life of your spoolies. They can also make your beauty routine less hygienic.

One common mistake is using harsh cleaners. Strong soaps or chemicals can dry out the bristles. They can also damage the glue that holds the brush together. Always choose mild soaps or special brush cleansers. These are made to be gentle. Avoid dish soap or household cleaners not meant for cosmetics.

Another mistake is getting water into the ferrule. This is the metal part where the bristles meet the handle. If water gets trapped here, it can loosen the glue. Bristles might start to fall out. Always clean your spoolie with the bristles pointing downwards. This lets water run off. Do not soak the entire spoolie. Just wet the bristles.

Not drying spoolies completely is also a big error. Damp bristles can grow mold and bacteria. This makes your clean spoolie dirty again. Always allow enough time for air drying. Never put damp spoolies into a closed bag or drawer. This traps moisture. It creates a perfect place for germs to grow. Taking these steps helps maintain a truly clean tool.

### When to Replace Spoolies: Knowing When to Let Go

Even with good cleaning, spoolies do not last forever. Knowing when to replace them is part of good beauty hygiene. Continuing to use an old, worn-out spoolie can be as bad as using a dirty one. It affects performance and hygiene.

For disposable mascara wands, the answer is simple: use them once and throw them away. These are designed for single use. This prevents germ transfer. Many beauty professionals use them this way. They offer the highest level of hygiene for each client.

For reusable spoolies, like those that come with eyebrow gels or as standalone tools, look for signs of wear. If the bristles become splayed, bent, or sparse, it is time for a new one. Worn bristles cannot comb or separate properly. They will not give you the neat finish you want. The tool becomes less effective.

If you notice any strange smell coming from your spoolie, replace it immediately. An odor often means bacterial growth, even if you clean it. Also, if you have had an eye infection, throw out any spoolies you used during that time. Do not risk reinfection. Generally, replacing reusable spoolies every 3-6 months is a good rule of thumb. This ensures you always use a fresh and effective tool.
