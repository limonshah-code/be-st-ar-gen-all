## How Big Will Your Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd Mix Get?

Bringing a new puppy home is exciting. One of the first things I always wonder is, "How big will this little furball become?" This is especially true when considering a hybrid like the Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mix. This wonderful cross brings together two very different, yet equally charming, breeds. Knowing their potential size helps you prepare your home and lifestyle.

In this article, we will explore the typical size ranges for a Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mix. We will also look at the parent breeds, the Bernese Mountain Dog and the Australian Shepherd, to understand their contributions. I will share insights into the factors that affect a mix's final size and what to expect during their growth journey. Let's find out how big your future furry friend might grow.

### Takeaway:
*   A Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mix's size varies greatly based on parent genetics.
*   Expect them to range from medium to large.
*   Factors like gender, diet, and overall health play a role in their final size.

A Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mix typically reaches a height of 20-27 inches and a weight of 50-90 pounds when fully grown. Their final size depends heavily on which parent breed's genetics are more dominant and other factors like diet and exercise.

### Understanding the Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd Mix

The Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mix combines the gentle strength of the Bernese Mountain Dog with the agile intelligence of the Australian Shepherd. This cross aims to blend the best traits of both breeds. Many people are curious if you can truly breed these two distinct dogs. Yes, breeders successfully cross them, creating a dog known for its striking looks and balanced temperament. This mix often inherits a thick coat, intelligent eyes, and a sturdy build. The resulting dog usually has a strong desire to please its family.

This mixed breed is often called a "designer dog." Designer dogs are crosses between two purebred parents. They aim to produce puppies with specific desired traits from both lines. Each puppy in a litter can inherit different traits. This means some puppies might lean more towards their Bernese parent's size and build. Others might take after their Australian Shepherd parent in terms of agility and leaner body. It is important to know the characteristics of both parent breeds to understand your mix.

### The Bernese Mountain Dog: A Gentle Giant

The Bernese Mountain Dog is a large, sturdy breed known for its calm and loyal nature. Originating from the Swiss Alps, these dogs were historically used for herding and guarding livestock. Their size reflects their working background. I find their presence quite comforting; they are big dogs with even bigger hearts. Understanding this parent breed is key when predicting your Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mix's eventual size.

Adult male Bernese Mountain Dogs typically stand 25 to 27.5 inches tall at the shoulder. They weigh between 80 to 115 pounds. Females are slightly smaller, usually 23 to 26 inches tall and weighing 70 to 95 pounds. These dogs have a powerful, muscular build. They have a distinctive tricolor coat. Their large size means they need space and proper nutrition. There are many aspects to consider with their size, including the [pros and cons of a Bernese Mountain Dog](https://beacleaner.com/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-a-bernese-mountain-dog). Their sheer size also means they need proper joint care throughout their lives.

### The Australian Shepherd: Agile and Medium-Sized

The Australian Shepherd is a medium-sized dog known for its intelligence, energy, and strong herding instincts. Despite their name, these dogs actually developed in the American West. They helped ranchers manage livestock. Aussies are known for their striking merle coats and often have captivating blue or heterochromatic eyes. They are incredibly athletic and agile. If you are unsure about identifying an Australian Shepherd, their build and working drive are key indicators.

Adult male Australian Shepherds usually stand 20 to 23 inches tall at the shoulder. They weigh between 50 to 65 pounds. Females are a bit smaller, typically 18 to 21 inches tall and weighing 40 to 55 pounds. They have a lean, athletic build. Aussies are built for speed and endurance, not sheer bulk. This contrasts sharply with the Bernese Mountain Dog's heavier frame. This size difference between the parent breeds means the mix's size can vary a lot.

### Predicting Your Bernese Aussie Mix's Size

Predicting the exact size of any mixed-breed dog can be tricky. With a Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mix, this holds true. You are combining a large breed with a medium-sized one. The outcome is not always a perfect average. Several factors determine how big your Bernese Aussie mix will get. I always remind new owners that genetics play the biggest role.

Here are the key factors:
*   **Parental Genetics:** The size of the Bernese Mountain Dog parent and the Australian Shepherd parent matters most. If one parent is larger or smaller than average for its breed, this can influence the puppy. If the Bernese parent's genes are more dominant for size, the puppy will likely be larger. If the Australian Shepherd's genes are more dominant, the puppy may be closer to a medium size.
*   **Gender:** Male dogs generally grow larger and heavier than females within the same litter. This applies to mixes just as it does to purebreds.
*   **Nutrition:** A balanced, high-quality diet during growth is crucial. Poor nutrition can hinder a puppy's development and stunt their growth. Overfeeding can lead to obesity, which puts strain on growing joints.
*   **Overall Health:** Any significant illness or injury during puppyhood can impact growth. Healthy puppies reach their full potential size.
*   **Litter Size:** Sometimes, puppies from very large litters might be slightly smaller, especially if resources were strained during gestation. However, this factor is usually minor.

Understanding these factors helps manage expectations. For general guidance on how to estimate a puppy's adult size, you can apply similar principles to how experts predict the size of other breeds.

### Average Size Range for a Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd Mix

Based on their parent breeds, the Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mix typically falls into a medium to large size category. Their final weight and height will depend heavily on the genetic contribution from each parent. There is a broad spectrum of possibilities for their adult dimensions. I have seen some mixes that strongly resemble a larger Australian Shepherd, while others look like a slightly smaller Bernese.

On average, a fully grown Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mix can stand between **20 to 27 inches tall** at the shoulder. Their weight usually ranges from **50 to 90 pounds**.

*   **Males:** Males of this mix tend to be on the larger end of the spectrum. They might weigh anywhere from 65 to 90 pounds. Their height typically falls between 22 to 27 inches.
*   **Females:** Females are generally smaller. They may weigh 50 to 75 pounds. Their height usually ranges from 20 to 25 inches.

These are average ranges, and individual dogs can certainly be outside these numbers. Some Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mixes might be smaller if they inherit more from the Australian Shepherd side. Others might be larger if they get more Bernese genes. A similar variability in size can be observed in other large breed mixes, such as when considering [how much does a Bernese Mountain Dog German Shepherd mix weight](https://beacleaner.com/how-much-does-a-bernese-mountain-dog-german-shepherd-mix-weight). Always ask a reputable breeder about the size of the specific parent dogs to get a better estimate.

### Growth Timeline: When Your Bernese Aussie Reaches Full Size

Understanding the growth timeline for your Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mix helps you track their development. Like most dogs, these mixes experience rapid growth during their first year. However, larger breeds and their mixes generally take longer to reach their full adult size compared to smaller breeds. My experience tells me that patience is key when watching a large puppy grow.

Here's a general growth timeline:
*   **Birth to 6 months:** This is a period of very rapid growth. Puppies will gain significant weight and height each month. Their basic adult shape begins to form. They will often reach about 50-70% of their adult height and weight by six months.
*   **6 months to 12 months:** Growth continues, but at a slower pace. They will fill out more, gaining muscle mass and refining their body structure. Most Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mixes will reach close to their adult height by 10-12 months.
*   **12 months to 18-24 months:** While height growth largely stops around 12 months, weight gain and muscle development can continue. Larger mixes, especially those leaning more towards the Bernese side, might continue to fill out until they are 18 to 24 months old. This means they gain more bulk, not necessarily more height.

Always consult your veterinarian for advice on your specific dog's growth and weight. They can help ensure your dog is on a healthy growth trajectory. Proper nutrition throughout these stages is vital for healthy bone and joint development.

### Living with a Large or Medium-Large Mix: Space and Care Considerations

The potential size of your Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mix has practical implications for your home and lifestyle. These dogs are not tiny lap dogs. They will need adequate space to live comfortably. I've always found that a larger dog needs more than just floor space; they need room to move, play, and stretch out without feeling cramped.

Here are some considerations for living with a Bernese Aussie mix:
*   **Living Space:** They will need a home with enough room for them to move around. A house with a fenced yard is ideal, but they can adapt to an apartment if they receive plenty of outdoor exercise. Make sure they have a comfortable, appropriately sized dog bed.
*   **Exercise Needs:** Both parent breeds are active. The Bernese Mountain Dog enjoys walks and outdoor activities. The Australian Shepherd needs significant mental and physical stimulation. Your mix will likely need at least 60-90 minutes of vigorous exercise daily. This might include long walks, runs, hikes, or playing fetch. Regular exercise helps maintain a healthy weight and builds strong muscles.
*   **Food Costs:** Larger dogs eat more food. Be prepared for higher monthly food bills. Investing in high-quality dog food is important for their health and growth. This ensures they get the nutrients needed for their larger bodies and higher energy levels.
*   **Veterinary Care:** Larger dogs can sometimes be prone to certain health conditions, like hip or elbow dysplasia. These conditions are common in large breeds. Regular veterinary check-ups are essential. Early detection of any issues can make a big difference. I always make sure to keep up with my dogs' annual vet visits.
*   **Training and Socialization:** Training a larger dog from a young age is crucial. A well-behaved large dog is a joy. An untrained one can be difficult to manage. Positive reinforcement methods work best. Early socialization helps them develop into confident, friendly adults.

Considering these factors upfront helps ensure you provide a happy and healthy life for your large or medium-large Bernese Mountain Australian Shepherd mix.
