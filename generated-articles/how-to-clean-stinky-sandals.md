We will cover why sandals get smelly, what supplies you need, and specific cleaning steps for different materials. You will also find tips to prevent future odors. Get ready to enjoy fresh-smelling footwear once again.

### Takeaway

Getting rid of sandal odor is simple. Focus on removing bacteria, using natural deodorizers, and proper drying. Regular care keeps your sandals fresh.

### Main Query Answer

To clean stinky sandals, wash them with mild soap and water, targeting footbeds and straps. Use odor-absorbing agents like baking soda or white vinegar for stubborn smells. Ensure thorough drying to prevent mold and mildew growth.

## Understanding Stinky Sandals: The Root Causes

Your sandals get stinky for clear reasons. Understanding these helps you clean them better. It also helps you prevent smells in the future. We often wear sandals without socks. This direct contact with skin leads to specific issues. Let's look at the main reasons for unpleasant sandal odors.

### Sweat and Bacteria Build-up

Sweat is a primary cause of sandal smell. Your feet have many sweat glands. When you wear sandals, your feet sweat. This moisture gets trapped in the sandal's footbed. Sweat itself does not smell. But it creates a perfect environment. This environment allows bacteria to grow. These bacteria are naturally present on your skin. They break down the sweat and dead skin cells. This process creates volatile organic compounds. These compounds are what produce the bad smell. Regular wear means more sweat and more bacteria activity.

### Material Absorption

Different sandal materials absorb sweat and odors differently. Porous materials are more likely to trap smells. Materials like leather, suede, and fabric absorb moisture. They hold onto bacteria and their byproducts. This makes them smell worse over time. Synthetic materials, like rubber or EVA foam, are less absorbent. However, they can still harbor bacteria on their surfaces. The footbed material often determines how quickly a sandal becomes stinky. A dirty footbed is a common source of bad odor. Addressing this part is key when you **clean stinky sandals**. For specific types of sandals, cleaning the footbed is crucial, like when you [clean the footbed of sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-footbed-of-sandals).

### Lack of Proper Cleaning

Many people do not clean their sandals regularly. This allows smells to build up. Over time, layers of sweat, dirt, and bacteria accumulate. A quick rinse might not remove everything. Deep cleaning is necessary. If you never clean them, the odor becomes very strong. It can even become hard to remove. Proper and consistent cleaning prevents this. It keeps your sandals fresh. It also extends their life. Learning to **clean stinky sandals** well keeps them wearable.

## Essential Supplies for Odor Removal

Before you start cleaning, gather your tools. Having the right supplies makes the process easy. You probably have most of these items already. They are common household products. These items will help you tackle odors. They will also clean the sandal surfaces. Prepare everything before you begin.

### Basic Cleaning Agents

You need simple cleaning agents for sandal care. Mild dish soap is excellent. It cuts through grease and dirt effectively. You can also use a gentle laundry detergent. These cleaners break down oils and lift away grime. Water is essential for rinsing. A bucket or sink filled with warm water works well. A soft brush or old toothbrush helps scrub surfaces. These tools get into small areas. They remove dirt trapped in textures. For very dirty sandals, a stiff brush might be needed. Always start with mild options. Strong chemicals can damage sandal materials.

### Natural Deodorizers

Nature provides great odor neutralizers. Baking soda is a top choice. It absorbs odors and moisture. White vinegar is another powerful deodorizer. Its acidic nature kills bacteria. It also helps break down odor-causing compounds. Essential oils, like tea tree or eucalyptus, offer a fresh scent. They also have antibacterial properties. Activated charcoal inserts can absorb smells over time. These natural options are safe for most sandals. They do not introduce harsh chemicals. They are perfect for when you need to **clean stinky sandals** without damaging them.

### Cleaning Tools

The right tools help with effective cleaning. A soft cloth or sponge is good for general wiping. An old toothbrush is perfect for scrubbing footbeds and straps. Its small bristles reach tight spots. For tough stains or textured soles, a stiffer utility brush works. A microfiber cloth is excellent for drying. It absorbs water quickly. This speeds up drying time. Quick drying prevents new odors. It also prevents mildew growth. Ensure your tools are clean before use. This prevents transferring dirt to your sandals.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Clean Stinky Sandals (General Method)

Ready to make your sandals smell good again? This general method works for most washable sandals. It targets the main sources of odor. Follow these steps for a fresh result. This process is straightforward and effective.

### Initial Preparation

First, prepare your sandals. Remove any loose dirt. You can tap them together. Or you can use a dry brush. This removes sand, dust, or mud. Next, check the material. Is it safe to get wet? Most synthetic, rubber, or plastic sandals are fine. Some natural materials like suede or certain leathers need special care. If unsure, test a small, hidden area first. Once prepared, find a suitable cleaning area. A utility sink or an outdoor space works well. Gather your mild soap, brushes, and a bucket of warm water. This readiness helps you **clean stinky sandals** efficiently. Consider specific models like [how to clean Reef sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-reef-sandals) or [how to clean Olukai sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-olukai-sandals) as their materials may vary slightly.

### Cleaning the Footbed and Straps

The footbed is where most odors live. Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water. Dip your brush into the soapy water. Scrub the entire footbed vigorously. Pay close attention to textured areas. These grooves trap dirt and sweat. Apply more soapy water as needed. Next, clean the straps. Use the same soapy water and brush. Gently scrub both sides of the straps. Make sure to clean any buckles or embellishments. Rinse your brush often to keep it clean. This ensures you are removing dirt, not spreading it around. Work methodically to cover all surfaces. This deep cleaning helps immensely when you want to **clean stinky sandals**.

### Rinsing and Drying

Rinsing is a critical step. Rinse the sandals thoroughly under cool, running water. Make sure no soap residue remains. Soap left behind can attract more dirt. It can also irritate your feet. Rinse until the water runs clear. Once rinsed, shake off excess water. Then, pat the sandals dry with a clean towel. For best results, air dry your sandals. Place them in a well-ventilated area. Choose a spot away from direct sunlight or heat. Direct sun can fade colors or warp materials. Heat can damage adhesives. Allow them to dry completely. This might take several hours or even a full day. Incomplete drying leads to mildew and new odors. You do not want to go through the process of cleaning again right away. Proper drying completes the process of how to **clean stinky sandals**.

## Cleaning Different Sandal Materials

Not all sandals are the same. Different materials need different cleaning approaches. Using the wrong method can cause damage. Always check the sandal's specific care instructions if available. Here, we cover common sandal materials. This helps you tailor your cleaning method.

### Leather and Suede Sandals

Leather and suede require delicate care. These materials are porous. They absorb moisture and odors easily. Do not submerge them in water. For leather, wipe the surface with a damp cloth. Use a mild leather cleaner. Apply a small amount and wipe gently. For suede, use a specialized suede brush. Brush away dirt and stains. For spots, use a suede eraser. For odors, sprinkle baking soda on the footbed. Let it sit overnight. Then, brush it off. Never use harsh soaps or excessive water. Water can stain or stiffen leather and suede. Air dry away from direct heat. Proper care preserves their look and feel. This applies to specific types too, such as when you [clean suede insoles of sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-suede-insoles-of-sandals). If you own designer sandals, consider specific guides, like [how to clean Tory Burch sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-tory-burch-sandals).

### Rubber, EVA, and Plastic Sandals

These materials are generally durable and water-friendly. Examples include flip-flops, slides, and some comfort sandals. You can wash them with soap and water. Use a brush to scrub the entire surface. Pay attention to textured areas. A mixture of mild dish soap and warm water works well. For persistent odors, soak them in a white vinegar and water solution. Use a 1:1 ratio. Soak for 30 minutes. Then, scrub and rinse thoroughly. These materials dry quickly. Place them in a well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight for prolonged periods. Strong sun can sometimes cause warping. This method applies to popular brands too, for instance, when you need to [clean stinky Crocs](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stinky-crocs) or [clean Oofos sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-oofos-sandals).

### Fabric and Canvas Sandals

Fabric and canvas sandals are also quite washable. They are common in casual styles. Examples include many types of [Rainbow sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-rainbow-sandals) or [Clarks Cloudstepper sandals](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-clarks-cloudstepper-sandals). Mix mild soap or laundry detergent with water. Use a soft brush to scrub the fabric. Be gentle to avoid damaging the fibers. For tough stains, a paste of baking soda and water can help. Apply it, let it sit, then scrub gently. Rinse thoroughly to remove all soap. Excess soap can leave residue. Air dry completely. Do not put them in a dryer. High heat can shrink or damage the fabric. Stuffing them with newspaper can help absorb moisture during drying. It also helps maintain their shape. Ensure they are fully dry before wearing again. This prevents mildew growth.

## Advanced Odor Solutions for Stubborn Smells

Sometimes, basic cleaning is not enough. Stubborn odors need extra treatment. These advanced methods target deep-seated smells. They use powerful natural agents. These solutions can save your favorite sandals. They can make them wearable again.

### Baking Soda Power

Baking soda is a natural miracle worker for odors. It absorbs smells rather than masking them. After cleaning your sandals, make sure they are dry. Then, sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda inside each sandal. Cover the entire footbed. You can also sprinkle some inside the straps. Let it sit overnight, or for 24 hours. The longer it sits, the more odor it absorbs. After the time passes, shake out the baking soda. You can also use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment. This removes all powder. Your sandals should smell much fresher. This method is safe for almost all materials. It works wonders when you need to **clean stinky sandals**.

### Vinegar Solution

White vinegar is another powerful odor killer. Its acetic acid neutralizes bacteria and mold. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution generously onto the footbeds and straps. Let it sit for about 30 minutes. Do not rinse immediately. The vinegar needs time to work. After 30 minutes, rinse the sandals thoroughly with cool water. Make sure to remove all vinegar smell. Then, air dry completely. The vinegar smell will dissipate as the sandals dry. This method is very effective for strong odors. It also disinfects the sandals. Some sandal types, like [Birkenstocks](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stinky-birkenstocks), often benefit from this method for their footbeds.

### Freezing Method

This might sound strange, but freezing can kill odor-causing bacteria. Place your clean, dry sandals in a sealed plastic bag. This prevents moisture or smells from the freezer from affecting them. Place the bag in the freezer overnight. The cold temperatures kill bacteria. In the morning, remove them from the freezer. Let them thaw completely. The odor should be significantly reduced. This method does not clean dirt. It only targets the bacteria. So, always clean your sandals first. This is a good complementary step. It works well for a quick refresh between washes.

### Essential Oils and Commercial Sprays

For a pleasant finishing touch, consider essential oils. Tea tree oil has antibacterial properties. Lavender or eucalyptus oils offer fresh scents. Mix a few drops of essential oil with water in a spray bottle. Lightly mist the inside of your dry sandals. Do not overdo it. Too much oil can leave a residue. You can also use commercially available shoe deodorizer sprays. Choose products specifically designed for footwear. Many contain zinc ricinoleate or other odor-absorbing agents. Always follow product instructions. Some sprays also offer antifungal benefits. These sprays provide a quick refresh. They also help maintain freshness between deep cleans.

## Preventing Future Sandal Odor

Cleaning stinky sandals is great. But preventing them from getting smelly is even better. A little regular care goes a long way. These habits keep your sandals fresh. They also prolong the life of your footwear. Make these tips part of your routine.

### Regular Maintenance

Consistent, light cleaning prevents major odor problems. After each wear, wipe down the footbeds. Use a damp cloth or a quick spray with a mild disinfectant. This removes fresh sweat and dirt. It stops bacteria from settling in. For rubber or synthetic sandals, a quick rinse under the tap can be enough. For fabric or leather, a dry brush can remove dust. Do not wait for odors to become strong. Regular maintenance makes future deep cleans easier. It helps you avoid having to deep **clean stinky sandals** every time.

### Proper Storage

How you store your sandals matters. Never store wet or damp sandals. This encourages mold and mildew growth. Always ensure they are completely dry before putting them away. Store them in a well-ventilated area. Avoid cramped closets or plastic bags. Air circulation is key. If you store them for a long period, consider using cedar shoe trees. Cedar naturally absorbs moisture and odors. You can also place dryer sheets inside them. This keeps them smelling fresh.

### Rotation and Airing Out

Wearing the same sandals every day contributes to odor. Your feet sweat daily. The sandals do not get a chance to fully dry. Rotate your sandals. Give each pair at least 24 hours to air out between wears. This allows moisture to evaporate. It also allows the materials to dry completely. Place them in an open space. Let them breathe. Sunlight, even indirect, can help kill bacteria. This simple habit makes a big difference. It reduces the need to frequently **clean stinky sandals**.

### Foot Hygiene

Good foot hygiene plays a vital role. Clean feet mean less odor transfer to your sandals. Wash your feet daily with soap and water. Dry them thoroughly, especially between the toes. Consider using an antiperspirant or deodorizing powder on your feet. This reduces sweat. It also prevents bacteria growth. If you have excessive foot sweat, use moisture-wicking socks with certain sandal types. Addressing the source of sweat helps keep your sandals fresh. It is a proactive step in preventing sandal odors.
