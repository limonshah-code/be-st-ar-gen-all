### Answer to the main query

To clean Dyson Airwrap attachments, use warm water and mild soap for most plastic parts, gently wiping away product buildup and lint. For brush attachments, remove hair and use a damp cloth. Always ensure parts are completely dry before reattaching. Regularly clean the main filter with the provided brush.

## Understanding Your Dyson Airwrap Attachments

The Dyson Airwrap comes with various attachments. Each attachment serves a specific styling purpose. Knowing each one helps you clean it properly. Some attachments have delicate bristles. Others have vents or smooth surfaces.

For example, the curling barrels create curls and waves. They have small air vents that can collect hair and product. The smoothing brushes tame frizz and add volume. Their bristles can gather lint and hair. The pre-styling dryer prepares wet hair for styling. Its mesh can also become clogged. I always check each attachment closely before cleaning. This helps me find any specific areas that need extra attention. Proper identification ensures you use the correct cleaning method for each part.

## Essential Tools for Cleaning Dyson Airwrap Attachments

Cleaning your Dyson Airwrap attachments does not require many special tools. Most items you might already have at home. Using the correct tools prevents scratches or damage to your valuable device. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive materials. They can ruin the finish or functionality of the attachments.

You will need a few simple things. A soft microfiber cloth is essential for wiping surfaces. A small, soft brush, like an old toothbrush, helps remove stubborn debris. Mild dish soap or hand soap mixed with warm water creates a gentle cleaning solution. For the main filter, the Airwrap usually comes with a special cleaning brush. If you lost it, a soft, fine-bristled brush works well. Always make sure your tools are clean before you start cleaning your Airwrap.

*   **Soft Microfiber Cloths:** These are gentle on surfaces. They absorb water well.
*   **Mild Liquid Soap:** Dish soap or hand soap is ideal. Choose one without harsh additives.
*   **Warm Water:** Luke warm water helps break down product buildup.
*   **Small, Soft Brush:** An old, clean toothbrush works for intricate parts.
*   **Dyson Filter Cleaning Brush:** This comes with your Airwrap. It is specific for the main filter.
*   **Small Bowl or Basin:** For mixing your cleaning solution.
*   **Paper Towels:** For drying initial excess water.

Having these items ready makes the cleaning process smooth. It also ensures you clean everything effectively. I always gather my supplies before starting. This helps me stay organized.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Airwrap Barrels

The curling barrels are likely the most used attachments. They come in different sizes to create various curl types. These barrels are prone to collecting hair strands and styling product residue. This buildup can affect the airflow and the quality of your curls. Regular cleaning keeps them performing efficiently.

Start by detaching the barrels from the main Airwrap unit. Never submerge the main unit in water. It contains electronics. Take a soft, dry cloth first. Use it to wipe away any loose hair or dust from the barrel's surface. Next, prepare a bowl of warm water with a small amount of mild soap. Dip a clean microfiber cloth into the soapy water. Wring out the cloth well so it is only damp, not dripping. Gently wipe down the entire surface of the curling barrel. Pay close attention to the small air vents and slots. These areas tend to accumulate more residue. If some residue is stubborn, use a cotton swab lightly dampened with the solution. Avoid letting water enter the internal mechanisms of the barrel. Once clean, use a separate, clean, damp cloth to wipe off any soap residue. Finally, dry the barrels thoroughly with a dry microfiber cloth. Let them air dry completely for several hours before reattaching. This prevents moisture from damaging the internal components. I usually let mine sit overnight to ensure they are perfectly dry.

*   **Remove Barrels:** Disconnect barrels from the Airwrap base.
*   **Wipe Loose Debris:** Use a dry microfiber cloth to remove hair and dust.
*   **Prepare Solution:** Mix warm water with a few drops of mild soap in a bowl.
*   **Damp Wipe:** Dip a microfiber cloth in the solution. Wring it out.
*   **Clean Surfaces:** Gently wipe the entire barrel, focusing on air vents.
*   **Rinse Soap:** Use a clean, damp cloth to remove all soap residue.
*   **Dry Thoroughly:** Dry with a dry cloth. Air dry for several hours.

## Cleaning the Smoothing and Volumizing Brushes

The Airwrap's smoothing brushes and round volumizing brush are fantastic for styling. They also gather a lot of hair and product buildup. Their bristles require a different cleaning approach compared to the barrels. You must be gentle to avoid bending or damaging the bristles. Damaged bristles can impact your hair styling results.

First, remove all visible hair strands from the bristles. You can use your fingers or a comb for this. Work slowly from the outer edges to the center. For the larger smoothing brushes, sometimes a thin stick or the end of a rat-tail comb helps lift tangled hair. Once all hair is gone, prepare a bowl of warm, soapy water. Dip only the bristle head into the water, being careful not to submerge the base or handle. Swirl it gently to loosen any product residue. For stubborn spots, use a soft toothbrush dipped in the soapy water. Gently brush the bristles. Then, rinse the bristle head under cool running water. Ensure all soap is gone. Shake off excess water. Place the brushes bristle-side down on a clean towel to air dry. Ensure they are completely dry before storage or use. This usually takes several hours. I often place them near a fan to speed up drying.

*   **Remove Hair:** Manually pull out all hair from the bristles. Use a comb if needed.
*   **Prepare Solution:** Mix warm water with mild soap.
*   **Dip Bristles:** Dip only the bristle head into the soapy water. Avoid the handle.
*   **Gently Clean:** Swirl the brush. Use a soft toothbrush for stubborn buildup.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse under cool water until no soap remains.
*   **Air Dry:** Place bristle-side down on a towel. Allow complete air drying.

## Maintaining the Pre-Styling Dryer and Diffuser

The pre-styling dryer prepares your hair for the main styling. It dries hair to an optimal dampness. If you have the Dyson Airwrap Complete, you might also have a diffuser attachment. These attachments often collect dust and lint from the air. Over time, this can reduce their efficiency. Cleaning these parts ensures consistent airflow.

To clean the pre-styling dryer, first detach it from the main unit. Use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe down its exterior. Pay attention to the mesh filter on the inside. This mesh can trap lint and dust. You can use a soft brush or a cotton swab to gently dislodge any trapped particles from the mesh. Avoid pushing debris further in. If there is stubborn buildup, slightly dampen your cloth with warm, soapy water. Wipe the exterior and mesh area. Make sure no water enters the electrical components. For the diffuser, if you have one, use the same method. Gently wipe the prongs and the central mesh area. Ensure all parts are completely dry before reattaching them. Air drying is always the safest option for these components. A good wipe down after each use can prevent major buildup.

*   **Detach Attachment:** Remove the pre-styling dryer or diffuser.
*   **Wipe Exterior:** Use a dry microfiber cloth for the outside.
*   **Clean Mesh:** Gently brush or swab the internal mesh to remove lint.
*   **Damp Wipe (Optional):** Use a slightly damp, soapy cloth for stubborn residue.
*   **Dry Completely:** Ensure all parts are fully air-dried before use.

## Deep Cleaning the Airwrap Filter (Main Unit)

The main filter on your Dyson Airwrap's handle is crucial. It pulls in air for the styling process. If this filter gets clogged, the Airwrap's performance drops significantly. Hair products, dust, and lint can block the airflow. This can cause the tool to overheat or shut off. Dyson recommends cleaning this filter regularly. I check mine every few uses.

To clean the main filter, first unplug your Airwrap from the power outlet. This is a critical safety step. Locate the cylindrical filter cage at the bottom of the handle. Gently twist and pull the filter cage downwards to remove it. You will see a mesh filter inside. Use the dedicated Dyson filter cleaning brush that came with your Airwrap. If you do not have it, a clean, soft-bristled brush can work. Brush away all dust, hair, and lint from the mesh. Turn the filter cage while brushing to clean all sides. You may see a surprising amount of debris. For stubborn buildup, Dyson suggests using a damp, lint-free cloth to wipe the outside of the mesh. Do not use water directly on the filter itself, especially on the internal parts. You must not rinse the filter under water. This can damage the internal components. Once cleaned, align the filter cage with the handle and twist it back into place until it clicks. Cleaning this filter is vital for maintaining powerful airflow, just like cleaning filters on other Dyson products. For instance, [cleaning filters on a Dyson Ball vacuum](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-filters-on-dyson-ball) is equally important for its suction power. Similarly, maintaining the filter on a [Dyson Hot and Cool device](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dyson-hot-and-cool) ensures optimal air quality and performance. Also, the principles of [cleaning a Dyson blow dryer filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dyson-blow-dryer-filter) are very similar, emphasizing gentle brushing and avoiding water for internal components.

*   **Unplug Device:** Always disconnect the Airwrap from power first.
*   **Remove Filter Cage:** Gently twist and pull the filter from the handle.
*   **Brush Clean:** Use the Dyson filter brush or a soft brush to remove debris.
*   **Wipe Exterior (Optional):** Use a damp, lint-free cloth for outside residue. Do not rinse the filter under water.
*   **Reattach Filter:** Align and twist the filter cage back into the handle until it clicks.

## Regular Maintenance Schedule and Best Practices

Establishing a regular cleaning schedule for your Dyson Airwrap attachments is key. It ensures your device remains in top condition. How often you clean depends on how frequently you use your Airwrap. Heavy users may need to clean more often. Light users can clean less frequently.

I recommend a quick clean after every few uses. This involves wiping down attachments and checking for hair. A deeper clean should happen once a month. This includes the thorough cleaning of all attachments and the main filter. If you use a lot of hair products, you might need to deep clean more often. Always store your Airwrap and its attachments in a clean, dry place. The original storage case is excellent for this. It protects them from dust and damage. Avoid dropping attachments. Even small impacts can affect their performance. Never use harsh cleaning agents like bleach or abrasive scrubbers. They can damage the delicate surfaces and internal parts. Allowing all parts to air dry completely is non-negotiable. Moisture can lead to mold or damage electrical components. These practices extend the life of your Airwrap. They also ensure it always performs at its peak.

*   **Quick Clean:** After every 3-4 uses, wipe attachments and remove visible hair.
*   **Deep Clean:** Monthly, perform a thorough cleaning of all attachments and the main filter.
*   **Store Properly:** Keep the Airwrap and attachments in their case or a dry, protected spot.
*   **Avoid Harsh Cleaners:** Use only mild soap and water. No bleach or abrasives.
*   **Ensure Dryness:** Always let attachments air dry completely before reassembly.

## Troubleshooting Common Cleaning Issues

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter some common issues. Product buildup can be very stubborn. Sometimes, hair gets stuck in hard-to-reach places. Knowing how to troubleshoot these problems helps you keep your Airwrap spotless. Do not force anything or use sharp objects. This can cause permanent damage to the attachments.

If product residue is still sticky after a gentle wash, try increasing the soap concentration slightly in your warm water. Let the attachment soak for a few minutes, but never fully submerge electrical parts. Use a slightly firmer but still soft brush, like a dedicated detail brush, for stubborn areas. For hair trapped deep within bristles or vents, tweezers can be helpful. Pull the hair out carefully. Never cut the hair while it is still on the attachment, as this might scratch the surface. If you notice a strange smell, it could be old product residue or mold. A thorough cleaning, including the air filter, is necessary. Ensure thorough drying to prevent mold growth. If the Airwrap feels less powerful after cleaning, check the main filter again. Ensure it is clean and properly reinserted. A blocked filter is the most common reason for reduced performance. If issues persist after proper cleaning, consult the Dyson support website. They offer more specific guidance for complex problems.

*   **Stubborn Residue:** Increase soap concentration slightly. Let soak briefly. Use a detail brush.
*   **Trapped Hair:** Use tweezers to carefully pull out deeply stuck hair.
*   **Strange Smell:** Perform a thorough deep clean. Ensure complete drying to prevent mold.
*   **Reduced Power:** Recheck the main filter. Ensure it is clean and correctly installed.
*   **Persistent Issues:** Contact Dyson support for further assistance.
