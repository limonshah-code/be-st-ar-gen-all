## How to Clean Your Bissell Pet Pro for Optimal Performance

Pet owners know the struggle of keeping carpets clean. A Bissell Pet Pro machine becomes a true hero in this battle. It lifts stains and odors, making your home feel fresh again. But like any hard-working appliance, your Bissell Pet Pro needs proper care.

If you wonder **how to clean Bissell Pet Pro**, you are in the right place. A clean machine performs its best. It also lasts longer. Keeping your Pet Pro clean prevents clogs, bad smells, and inefficient cleaning. This article will show you simple steps to clean your Bissell Pet Pro. We cover daily care, deep cleaning, and important maintenance tips. You will learn to keep your cleaner ready for any pet mess.

### Takeaway:

*   Clean your Bissell Pet Pro after every use. This prevents odor and grime buildup.
*   Deep clean parts like the brush roll, nozzle, and tanks regularly.
*   Allow all components to air dry completely before storage.
*   Regular maintenance extends your machine's life and keeps it working well.

Your Bissell Pet Pro needs regular cleaning to work its best. You must empty and rinse tanks after each use. You should also clean the brush roll and nozzle. Periodically, you must deep clean internal parts. This process removes pet hair, dirt, and residue.

### Why Regular Cleaning Keeps Your Bissell Pet Pro Running

Your Bissell Pet Pro works hard to remove pet messes from your carpets. During its operation, dirt, pet hair, and dirty water pass through its parts. Over time, these residues build up. This buildup can reduce your machine's cleaning power. It can also cause unpleasant smells.

A dirty machine cannot clean effectively. Clogged nozzles spray less solution. Dirty brush rolls cannot scrub carpets well. Hair and debris can tangle around moving parts. This strains the motor and reduces its lifespan. Think of it like cleaning a vacuum bag; you empty it to keep suction strong. The same idea applies to your carpet cleaner.

Regular cleaning prevents these issues. It ensures your Bissell Pet Pro delivers the best clean every time. It keeps the motor healthy and the suction strong. A clean machine also dries faster. This helps prevent mildew and odors. You want your cleaner to smell fresh, not like old pet messes. Keeping your machine clean makes it reliable. It means your investment lasts longer. This also applies to other Bissell carpet cleaners.

### Daily After-Use Steps for Your Bissell Pet Pro

Cleaning your Bissell Pet Pro after each use is the most important step. This daily care stops dirt from hardening inside the machine. It also prevents odors from developing. This simple routine takes only a few minutes. It saves you from bigger cleaning jobs later.

#### Emptying and Rinsing Tanks

The first thing to do is empty the dirty water tank. This tank holds all the grime removed from your carpets. Pour out the dirty water into a sink or toilet. Then, rinse the tank thoroughly with clean, warm water. Swish the water around to remove any lingering debris. You can also wipe the inside with a damp cloth. Do not use soap in the dirty water tank.

Next, rinse the clean water tank. Even if you did not use all the solution, empty it. Leftover cleaning solution can become sticky or harbor bacteria. Fill the clean water tank with warm water and rinse it well. Let both tanks air dry completely before putting them back on the machine. This step prevents mildew growth.

#### Cleaning the Brush Roll and Nozzle

The brush roll does most of the scrubbing. Pet hair and carpet fibers can get tangled in it. Remove the brush cover according to your specific Bissell Pet Pro model's instructions. Carefully pull out any tangled hair or debris from the brush roll. You can use scissors to cut stubborn tangles. Rinse the brush roll under running water. Ensure all residue washes away.

The nozzle is the part that suctions dirty water from the carpet. It can become clogged with hair and debris. Remove the nozzle if your model allows. Rinse it under warm water. Use a soft brush or cloth to wipe away any residue. Make sure the suction path is clear. Proper cleaning of these parts ensures good performance. This applies to various models, including those like the Bissell Revolution Pet Pro. Cleaning your [Bissell Revolution Pet Pro](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-revolution-pet-pro) regularly keeps it running smoothly.

### Deep Cleaning the Bissell Pet Pro Brush Cover and Nozzle

Regular daily cleaning helps, but sometimes you need a deeper clean. The brush cover and nozzle are key areas for this. They come into direct contact with dirty water and debris. Over time, residue can build up, affecting suction and cleaning performance. This deep clean should happen every few uses, or when you notice performance issues.

First, unplug your Bissell Pet Pro from the power outlet. Safety always comes first. Most Bissell Pet Pro models have a removable brush cover and nozzle. Check your user manual for specific instructions on how to detach them. Often, you will find latches or tabs to release these parts. Take your time to avoid breaking any plastic clips.

Once removed, take the brush cover to a sink. Rinse it thoroughly with warm water. Look for any trapped pet hair, lint, or debris. Use an old toothbrush or a small brush to scrub away stubborn grime. Pay attention to the edges and crevices. The nozzle also needs careful cleaning. It often has a clear plastic cover. This allows you to see the dirty water passing through. This section can get very dirty. Rinse the nozzle well. Check for blockages in the suction path. You might see pet hair clogs here. Use a narrow brush or even a straightened paper clip to gently clear any obstructions. Ensure water flows freely through it.

After cleaning, let these parts air dry completely. This step is crucial. Wet parts encourage mold and mildew growth. Place them on a towel or drying rack in a well-ventilated area. Once dry, reattach them to your Bissell Pet Pro. Make sure they click securely into place. This deep cleaning helps maintain strong suction. It also prevents your machine from developing a bad odor.

### Cleaning the Bissell Pet Pro Hose and Tools

Your Bissell Pet Pro often comes with a hose and various attachment tools. These tools are great for cleaning upholstery, stairs, and tight spots. However, they also collect a lot of dirt, pet hair, and cleaning solution residue. Cleaning these components is as important as cleaning the main unit. Neglecting them can lead to clogs and bad smells.

The hose is especially prone to trapping debris. It can hold dirty water even after you finish cleaning. To clean the hose, you can "flush" it. Fill your clean water tank with warm water, without cleaning solution. Attach a tool, like the stain tool, to the hose. Point the tool into a sink or bucket. Turn on the machine and press the spray trigger. Let the warm water run through the hose until it comes out clear. This flushes out any trapped dirt and residue. Repeat this process a few times until the water runs completely clean.

For the attachment tools themselves, simple rinsing is usually enough. Detach each tool from the hose. Hold them under running warm water. Use your fingers or a small brush to wipe away any visible dirt or pet hair. Pay attention to the suction opening and the spray nozzle on the tools. Make sure these are clear and free of blockages. For tougher buildup, you can soak the tools in a solution of warm water and a small amount of vinegar for 15 minutes. This helps loosen stubborn grime. Rinse them again after soaking.

After cleaning, let the hose and all attachment tools air dry completely. Hang the hose to allow water to drain out fully. Place the tools on a clean towel. Proper drying prevents mildew and keeps your tools ready for the next use. This thorough approach makes sure all parts of your Pet Pro work perfectly. It also applies to smaller Bissell machines.

### Monthly Maintenance for Your Bissell Pet Pro

Beyond daily and deep cleaning, your Bissell Pet Pro benefits from monthly maintenance. This routine involves checking components you might not clean as often. It ensures all parts are working correctly. It also helps prevent major problems before they start. Regular checks can extend the life of your machine.

#### Inspecting Filters

Many Bissell Pet Pro models have filters. These filters help protect the motor from dirt and debris. They can become clogged over time. Check your user manual to locate any filters on your specific model. Some filters might be washable, while others need replacement. If your filter is washable, rinse it under warm water. Gently squeeze out excess water. Allow it to air dry completely for at least 24 hours. A damp filter can damage the motor when you turn the machine on. If your filter is not washable, tap out any loose debris. Replace it according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A clean filter improves suction and keeps your machine running efficiently.

#### Checking Belts and Components

Take a moment to inspect other parts of your Bissell Pet Pro. Check the brush belt if your model has one. Look for any signs of wear, fraying, or looseness. A worn belt can make the brush roll stop spinning or spin weakly. If the belt looks damaged, replace it. Also, examine the wheels and external body of the machine. Wipe down any dust or dirt. Ensure all latches and covers close securely. You want everything to fit tightly. This prevents leaks and ensures proper suction.

Store your Bissell Pet Pro in a dry, safe place after cleaning and drying. Avoid storing it in areas with extreme temperatures. This includes very cold garages or hot attics. Proper storage further protects the machine. This monthly check-up ensures your Pet Pro remains a reliable cleaning partner. Different Bissell models might have slightly different parts to check. For instance, if you have a ProHeat Pet Turbo, you may want to look up specific instructions on [how to clean Bissell ProHeat Pet Turbo](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-proheat-pet-turbo) for its unique features.

### Tackling Stubborn Odors and Buildup in Your Pet Pro

Sometimes, despite regular cleaning, your Bissell Pet Pro might develop a lingering smell. This often happens from leftover pet dander, dirt particles, or cleaning solution residue. These smells can transfer back to your carpets if not addressed. Tackling stubborn odors requires a few extra steps. You can eliminate these unpleasant smells and keep your machine fresh.

First, ensure all parts you normally clean are spotless. This includes the dirty water tank, brush roll, and nozzle. Pay extra attention to small crevices where grime can hide. If you find a persistent odor, a vinegar rinse can help. Vinegar is a natural deodorizer. Fill the clean water tank with warm water and about 1 cup of white vinegar. Run this solution through the machine as if you were cleaning a carpet. Point the hose or main nozzle into a sink or bucket. Let the vinegar solution flow through the machine's internal parts. This helps flush out odor-causing bacteria and residue.

After the vinegar rinse, fill the clean water tank with plain warm water. Run this plain water through the machine to rinse out any vinegar smell. You do not want vinegar residue left in your machine. Once flushed, disassemble all removable parts. This includes tanks, brush rolls, and nozzles. Wash them thoroughly with warm, soapy water. Use a mild dish soap. Scrub surfaces with a brush. This helps break down any sticky residue that might be holding onto odors.

The most important step for odor elimination is complete drying. Every single part must be completely dry before reassembly. Dampness encourages mold and mildew, which cause terrible smells. Leave all parts out in a well-ventilated area for at least 24-48 hours. You can even place them near a fan to speed up the drying process. Make sure air circulates around all components. Once completely dry, put your Bissell Pet Pro back together. It should now smell fresh and clean. This thorough process will ensure your Bissell Pet Pro is always ready for its next job, free of any unpleasant surprises.

### Common Cleaning Mistakes to Avoid with Your Bissell Pet Pro

Keeping your Bissell Pet Pro clean is important. But knowing what *not* to do is just as vital. Avoiding common cleaning mistakes helps your machine last longer. It also ensures your machine works effectively every time. These mistakes can lead to reduced performance, bad odors, or even damage to your cleaner.

One major mistake is not emptying the dirty water tank immediately after use. This allows grime and pet hair to sit and solidify. It creates a breeding ground for bacteria and mold. These cause foul odors. Always empty and rinse the dirty water tank right away. This simple action prevents many problems.

Another mistake is leaving water or cleaning solution in the clean water tank. Even clean water can grow stagnant. Cleaning solution can become sticky or leave residue. Empty both tanks completely after each use. Rinse them well with warm water. This keeps your machine fresh.

Failing to thoroughly dry all components before storing the machine is a big error. Water left in tanks, hoses, or on brush rolls can lead to mildew and mold. This creates a terrible smell that transfers to your carpets. Always allow all removable parts to air dry completely. Give them at least 24 hours in a well-ventilated area. This step is crucial for preventing odors and keeping your machine hygienic.

Using the wrong cleaning solutions in your Bissell Pet Pro is also a common mistake. Do not use household cleaners not designed for carpet cleaners. Do not use harsh chemicals or strong detergents. These can damage your machine's internal components. They can void your warranty. Always use genuine Bissell cleaning solutions or those specifically labeled safe for carpet cleaners. Following these simple "don'ts" ensures your Bissell Pet Pro remains a reliable and odor-free cleaning tool for years to come.
