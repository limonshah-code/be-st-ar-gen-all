### How to Clean Brass Casings: A Quick Answer

To clean brass casings, you remove spent primers, then use methods like vibratory tumbling with dry media, ultrasonic cleaning with a liquid solution, or wet tumbling with stainless steel pins. Each method targets dirt, carbon, and tarnishing, preparing the cases for safe and effective reloading.

## Why Cleaning Brass Casings Matters

Cleaning brass casings is more than just making them look new. It serves several important purposes for anyone who reloads ammunition. Dirty cases can cause significant issues, affecting both safety and performance. I believe understanding these reasons helps you commit to the cleaning process.

Firstly, clean brass reduces wear on your reloading dies. When you resize a dirty case, abrasive particles on the brass can scratch the inside of your sizing die. This damage can lead to inconsistent sizing and reduced die life. Keeping your dies in good condition saves you money and ensures reliable operation. I always make sure my brass is clean to protect my equipment.

Secondly, clean cases ensure proper bullet seating and crimping. Carbon and dirt inside the case neck can prevent the bullet from seating straight or consistently. This affects overall cartridge length and bullet tension. A poorly seated bullet can lead to accuracy problems or even dangerous pressure spikes. Clean brass allows for uniform neck tension, which is crucial for consistent performance.

Thirdly, clean primer pockets are essential for reliable ignition. A dirty primer pocket, full of carbon residue, can prevent the new primer from seating fully or squarely. This can lead to misfires or hang-fires. Ensuring the primer sits flush and firm in a clean pocket guarantees dependable ignition every time you pull the trigger. This step really improves the reliability of your reloads.

Finally, clean brass is safer to handle. Dirty cases can have sharp edges from carbon buildup or be covered in lead residue. Cleaning removes these hazards, making the reloading process safer for you. It also prevents dirt from contaminating your reloading bench. Cleanliness promotes a safer and more enjoyable reloading experience overall.

## Essential Pre-Cleaning Steps for Brass Casings

Before you begin the main cleaning process, some vital preparatory steps are needed. These steps ensure your cleaning method works effectively and protects your equipment. Skipping them can lead to problems later on. I find these initial actions save a lot of trouble.

The first essential step is depriming. You should remove the spent primer from the case before cleaning. This allows your cleaning solution or media to reach the primer pocket. A clean primer pocket is vital for proper seating of a new primer. If you use wet cleaning methods, depriming also allows the cleaning solution to flow through the flash hole, cleaning the inside of the case more thoroughly. I always deprime my cases first.

After depriming, you must sort and inspect your brass casings. Sorting involves separating cases by caliber. Mixing different calibers can lead to problems during cleaning or future reloading steps. Inspection means checking each case for damage. Look for cracks, dents, or excessive case mouth splits. Discard any damaged cases. Using damaged brass is dangerous and should be avoided.

Sometimes, especially with heavily fouled or range brass, a preliminary rinse can be helpful. This removes loose dirt, sand, and other large debris. A simple rinse with water can prevent these larger particles from contaminating your main cleaning media or solution. This step is particularly useful before using a vibratory tumbler, as it keeps the media cleaner for longer. I often give very dirty brass a quick rinse.

These pre-cleaning steps might seem small, but they significantly impact your overall cleaning success. They ensure that your chosen cleaning method can perform its best. They also make the subsequent reloading steps smoother and safer. Investing a little time here pays off later.

## Vibratory Tumbling: A Popular Cleaning Method

Vibratory tumbling is a widely used method for cleaning brass casings. It is a dry process that polishes and cleans cases using abrasive media. Many reloaders choose this method for its simplicity and effectiveness. I use this method often for routine cleaning.

A vibratory tumbler works by vibrating a bowl filled with cleaning media and brass cases. This constant motion causes the media to rub against the brass, removing dirt, carbon, and light tarnish. The process is gentle on the brass, making it suitable for high volumes of cases. You can typically load a tumbler and let it run for several hours unattended.

### Choosing Your Tumbling Media

The type of media you use impacts cleaning results. Corn cob media is popular for polishing and light cleaning. It leaves a bright shine on the brass. Walnut shell media is more abrasive and better for removing heavy dirt and carbon buildup. Some reloaders mix corn cob and walnut for a balanced cleaning and polishing action. You can also add a small amount of brass polish to the media to enhance the shine. This helps clean tarnished areas and brings back the luster. To see how polishing agents can tackle tough stains on other brass items, consider methods for how to clean brass that has turned black.

### The Tumbling Process

To start, fill your tumbler with the chosen media. Add a capful or two of brass polish if desired. Then, add your deprimed and sorted brass casings. Do not overload the tumbler; leave enough space for the cases to move freely within the media. Turn on the tumbler and let it run. For routine cleaning, 2-4 hours is often enough. For very dirty cases, you might tumble for 6-8 hours or even overnight.

After tumbling, you need to separate the brass from the media. Most tumblers come with a sifting lid or you can use a separate media separator. This device quickly separates the clean brass from the media, which can then be reused. Remember that vibratory tumbling cleans the outside of the cases well, but it is less effective at cleaning primer pockets or the inside of the case. For other brass items that need general cleaning, understanding how to clean copper and brass can offer useful insights. This method provides a good balance of cleaning and convenience.

## Ultrasonic Cleaning: Precision and Shine

Ultrasonic cleaning offers a different approach to cleaning brass casings, using liquid solutions and high-frequency sound waves. This method provides a very thorough clean, reaching areas that dry media cannot. It is excellent for getting casings incredibly clean, inside and out. I find this method delivers impressive results.

An ultrasonic cleaner uses transducers to create sound waves in a liquid bath. These sound waves generate microscopic bubbles that implode against the surface of the brass. This process, called cavitation, dislodges dirt, carbon, and other residues from all surfaces, including primer pockets and the inside of the case. It is a gentle yet powerful way to clean. This method is effective even for [how to clean heavily corroded brass](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-heavily-corroded-brass).

### Setting Up Your Ultrasonic Cleaner

You need a good ultrasonic cleaning machine and a suitable cleaning solution. Many manufacturers offer specialized brass cleaning concentrates. You can also use a mixture of water, a small amount of dish soap, and a mild acid like citric acid or vinegar. Vinegar solutions are effective at removing tarnish and oxidation, similar to how [how to clean brass with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-brass-vinegar) works for other brass items. Follow the manufacturer's directions for the cleaner and solution concentrations.

Fill the ultrasonic tank with the cleaning solution. The water should be warm, as this enhances the cleaning action. Place your deprimed brass casings into the cleaner's basket. Do not overfill the basket. Ensure the cases are fully submerged in the solution.

### Ultrasonic Cleaning Steps

Once the cases are in the solution, turn on the ultrasonic cleaner. Most cleaners have timers, and a typical cycle lasts between 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the dirtiness of the brass. For very dirty cases, you might run multiple cycles or change the solution. The solution will become dirty as it removes contaminants from the brass.

After the cleaning cycle, remove the brass from the basket. Rinse the cases thoroughly with clean water. This step removes any remaining cleaning solution and loosened debris. Failing to rinse properly can leave a residue that might affect reloading.

The final and most crucial step is drying the brass completely. Wet brass can corrode or develop water spots. You can air dry the cases on a towel, use a fan, or place them in a case dryer. Some people even use a low-temperature oven (around 150-200°F or 65-93°C) for a short period. Ensure they are bone dry before storage or reloading. Ultrasonic cleaning provides a high level of cleanliness, especially inside the cases and primer pockets.

## Wet Tumbling with Stainless Steel Pins

Wet tumbling with stainless steel pins is a relatively newer method that delivers exceptionally clean and polished brass casings. This method provides a mirror-like shine and thoroughly cleans both the inside and outside of the cases, including primer pockets. I personally find the results from this method outstanding.

This method uses a rotary tumbler, water, a cleaning solution, and small stainless steel pins. The pins are heavier than brass and aggressively scrub all surfaces of the cases as the tumbler rotates. The water acts as a lubricant and carries away the dislodged dirt and carbon. This combination provides a powerful mechanical and chemical cleaning action.

### The Wet Tumbling Setup

You will need a rotary tumbler specifically designed for wet tumbling. These tumblers are typically watertight. You also need stainless steel media pins. These pins are small, durable, and do not wear down or get stuck in flash holes. For the cleaning solution, many reloaders use a small amount of liquid dish soap and a dash of citric acid or a specialized brass cleaning concentrate. The citric acid helps to remove tarnish and restore brightness, similar to how some acidic solutions remove tarnish from [how to clean unlacquered brass](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-unlacquered-brass).

To start, place your deprimed brass casings into the tumbler drum. Add the stainless steel pins. The general ratio is 1-2 pounds of pins per 5 pounds of brass, but check your tumbler's capacity. Fill the drum with water, leaving enough space for the cases and pins to tumble freely. Add your chosen cleaning solution.

### Steps for Wet Tumbling

Seal the tumbler drum tightly and place it on the tumbler base. Turn on the tumbler and let it run. Most wet tumbling cycles last between 1 to 4 hours. The dirtier the brass, the longer it will need to tumble. You will notice the water becoming very dark, indicating the cleaning action.

After tumbling, carefully separate the brass from the pins and dirty water. Many wet tumblers come with a rotary media separator that works with water. This separates the pins from the brass and allows you to collect the dirty water for disposal. Rinse the brass thoroughly under clean running water. This removes any cleaning solution residue and loose debris. This rinse is critical to prevent water spots and chemical residue.

### Drying Cleaned Brass Casings

Drying is the most critical step after wet tumbling. Any moisture left on the brass can lead to water spots or, worse, corrosion over time. Spread the cleaned, rinsed brass on a clean towel or mesh screen. You can use a fan to speed up air drying. Dedicated case dryers, often with warm air circulation, work very well. Some reloaders use a food dehydrator on a low setting. Ensure the brass is completely dry, inside and out, before storing or reloading. This careful drying preserves the incredible shine achieved by wet tumbling.

## Manual Cleaning Techniques

Sometimes, you only have a few cases to clean, or you need to focus on specific areas. Manual cleaning techniques are perfect for these situations. While they are more labor-intensive, they offer precise control and can be very effective for small batches or detailed work. I use these methods for small projects.

Hand cleaning individual casings allows you to inspect each one closely as you clean. You can use a brass brush, a nylon brush, or even steel wool pads for the exterior. For tougher stains, a mild abrasive cleaner designed for brass can be applied. Simply scrub the outside of the case until the desired cleanliness is achieved. This method is similar to how you might manually clean other brass items, such as [how to clean brass candlesticks](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-brass-candlesticks) or [how to clean brass door handles](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-brass-door-handles).

### Hand-Cleaning Individual Casings

To hand-clean, start by depriming the case. You can then use a damp cloth with a brass cleaner or a mild soap solution. Gently rub the outside of the casing. For stubborn spots, a non-abrasive scrubber can help. Rinse the case thoroughly under clean water afterward. Make sure to dry it completely to prevent water spots or tarnish. This method is great for small batches or when you want to give extra attention to each case.

### Specialized Tools for Detailed Cleaning

Beyond basic scrubbing, specific tools exist for detailed manual cleaning. A primer pocket cleaner tool is essential. This small brush or reamer removes carbon buildup from the primer pocket. A clean primer pocket ensures proper primer seating and reliable ignition. I always clean my primer pockets.

Inside neck brushes are also very useful. These small brushes clean the inside of the case neck. Carbon buildup inside the neck can affect bullet seating tension and accuracy. A quick twist of an inside neck brush cleans this area effectively. Some reloaders also use a chamfer and deburr tool. While primarily for preparing case mouths, it can also remove any lingering burrs or carbon around the mouth.

Manual cleaning is more time-consuming for large quantities. However, for a few dozen cases or for final touch-ups, it offers excellent control. It lets you ensure every part of the case meets your cleanliness standards. This attention to detail can contribute to more consistent and accurate reloads.

## Post-Cleaning & Storage of Brass Casings

Once your brass casings are sparkling clean, the work is not entirely done. Proper post-cleaning steps and storage are vital to maintain their condition and ensure they are ready for reloading. Skipping these steps can undo your cleaning efforts. I always take these final actions seriously.

First, you must inspect all cleaned brass. Even after thorough cleaning, some cases might have issues that were not visible before. Look for cracks, especially around the case mouth or neck. Check for deep scratches, dents, or signs of pressure. Discard any cases that show significant damage. Also, ensure the primer pockets and flash holes are clear of any debris or media. A quick visual check can prevent problems during reloading.

Next, consider applying case lube. This is not strictly part of cleaning but is essential before sizing brass. Case lube prevents cases from sticking in sizing dies. Apply a very thin layer evenly to the outside of the case bodies. Some reloaders tumble their cases in a small amount of dry lube media after cleaning. Proper lubrication protects your dies and makes the sizing process smoother.

### Proper Storage for Longevity

Storing your cleaned brass correctly prevents re-tarnishing and corrosion. Brass reacts with oxygen and moisture, which can cause it to tarnish over time. Store cleaned brass in airtight containers. Plastic bins or zip-top bags work very well. Remove as much air as possible before sealing. This limits exposure to humidity and oxygen.

Keep your stored brass in a cool, dry place. Avoid areas with high humidity, like basements or garages, unless you use dehumidifiers. Consistent temperature helps prevent condensation inside the storage containers. Adding a desiccant packet, like silica gel, to your storage containers can absorb any residual moisture. This extra step provides excellent protection against tarnish.

Proper storage ensures your hard work cleaning the brass lasts. When you are ready to reload, your cases will be in pristine condition. They will be free from tarnish, corrosion, and ready for the next steps in the reloading process. This attention to detail at the end of the cleaning cycle makes all the difference.
