### Understanding Your Hoover Smartwash

Your Hoover Smartwash is an advanced machine. It combines cleaning solution and strong suction. It removes dirt and stains from your carpets. The cleaner has separate tanks for clean water and dirty water. It also features a SmartWash automatic cleaning system. This system dispenses solution and dries your carpets. When it works well, it makes cleaning simple. Knowing its parts helps you troubleshoot problems effectively.

## Powering Up Your Hoover Smartwash

Your Hoover Smartwash needs power to work. If it does not turn on, check basic electrical connections first. This step often solves many problems quickly. Make sure the outlet works.

### Checking the Power Cord and Outlet

First, look at the power cord. Ensure it is fully plugged into the cleaner. Then, check the wall outlet. The outlet might be dead. Try plugging another appliance into the same outlet. This checks if the outlet has power.

If the outlet works, inspect the power cord. Look for cuts, frays, or damage. A damaged cord needs professional repair or replacement. Never use a cleaner with a damaged power cord. This ensures your safety.

### Resetting the Smartwash Unit

Many appliances have a reset button. Your Hoover Smartwash might have one too. Sometimes, a circuit overload causes the cleaner to stop. This built-in safety feature protects the motor. Find the reset button, usually near the power cord entry.

Press and hold the reset button for a few seconds. Release it and try turning on the cleaner again. If it still does not power on, leave it unplugged for 10-15 minutes. This allows the internal components to fully reset. Plug it back in and try turning it on.

## Addressing No Spray or Uneven Solution Dispensing

A carpet cleaner needs to spray solution. If your Hoover Smartwash does not spray, it cannot clean. This problem is common. Several things can cause it. We will check the tanks, the nozzle, and the solution path.

### Ensuring Tanks are Correctly Seated

Your Hoover Smartwash has two main tanks. One holds clean water and solution. The other collects dirty water. Both tanks must sit correctly. If a tank is loose, the cleaner cannot spray. The internal seals might not connect properly.

Remove both tanks. Empty the dirty water tank if it is full. Check for debris around the tank seals. Reinsert the clean water tank firmly until you hear a click. Then, reinsert the dirty water tank. Make sure both tanks are flush with the cleaner body. This simple step often fixes spray issues.

### Cleaning the Nozzle and Solution Path

The spray nozzle can get clogged. Dried solution or debris can block it. Small openings spray the water onto the carpet. If these openings are blocked, no water comes out. You need to clean them carefully.

Remove the nozzle assembly. Refer to your user manual for exact instructions. Use a small brush, like a toothbrush, to clean the nozzle holes. You can also use a paperclip to gently clear stubborn blockages. Ensure no residue remains. Rinse the nozzle with warm water. This clears any built-up detergent.

### Checking for Air Bubbles or Clogs

Air in the system can prevent spraying. Air bubbles can stop the pump from priming. This means water cannot move through the system. Make sure the clean water tank has enough water. Do not let it run completely dry. Running dry can introduce air.

Check the solution path from the tank to the nozzle. Look for any kinks in hoses. Sometimes, a tiny piece of carpet fiber or dirt gets stuck. This creates a partial clog. Disassemble parts as per your manual to inspect these paths. Clear any blockages you find. Ensure water flows freely through them.

## Restoring Suction and Water Recovery

Effective cleaning requires strong suction. Your Hoover Smartwash must pick up dirty water. If it leaves too much water behind, your carpets will take long to dry. They might even smell bad. Poor suction is a common problem. It often points to blockages in the system.

### Inspecting the Dirty Water Tank and Lid

The dirty water tank stores all the grime. If this tank is full, the cleaner cannot pick up more water. Empty the dirty water tank after each use. A full tank stops suction immediately. Always check its level during cleaning.

The lid of the dirty water tank also has a seal. This seal creates a vacuum. If the lid is not on correctly, or if the seal is dirty or damaged, suction will be lost. Remove the lid. Clean the rubber gasket thoroughly. Ensure no hair or debris blocks the seal. Reattach the lid firmly. This ensures a tight seal. For more specific guidance on dirty water tanks, especially relevant parts like the lid, you can also refer to tips for cleaning a [Hoover PowerDash Pet dirty water tank](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hoover-powerdash-pet-dirty-water-tank).

### Clearing Blockages in the Nozzle and Hose

The suction nozzle is where the dirty water enters the tank. This nozzle can become clogged easily. Hair, pet fur, and large debris can get stuck. Turn off and unplug your machine. Flip it over to inspect the bottom. Look at the opening where the water is sucked up. Remove any visible debris.

The hose leading from the nozzle to the dirty water tank can also clog. Sometimes, a large clump of hair or a piece of carpet forms a plug. Disconnect the hose if possible. Flush it with water from a faucet. You can use a long, flexible brush to push through stubborn clogs. Ensure the path is clear.

### Examining Brush Roll for Debris

The brush roll helps agitate the carpet. It also directs dirty water towards the suction nozzle. If the brush roll is wrapped with hair or fibers, it cannot spin freely. This affects cleaning performance and can also reduce suction. The spinning brushes help lift the carpet fibers. This allows for better water extraction.

Unplug the cleaner. Carefully remove any hair or string wrapped around the brush roll. You might need scissors. Clean the area around the brush roll. Ensure nothing obstructs its movement. A clean brush roll supports good suction. This ensures your carpet gets properly cleaned and dried.

## Resolving Leaks and Drips

Finding puddles under your Hoover Smartwash is frustrating. Leaks mean water is going where it should not. This problem often comes from loose parts or worn seals. You can usually fix leaks quickly. Pay close attention to connections.

### Checking Tank Seals and Gaskets

Your cleaner has several rubber seals. These gaskets sit around the tanks. They prevent water from leaking out. If a seal is cracked, twisted, or missing, water will escape. Remove the clean and dirty water tanks. Examine the rubber gaskets around the openings.

Clean these seals with a damp cloth. Make sure no dirt or hair sticks to them. This debris can break the seal. Reinsert the tanks firmly. Make sure they click into place. A tight fit is essential for preventing leaks. If a seal looks damaged, you might need to order a replacement part.

### Securing Hoses and Connections

The Hoover Smartwash uses internal hoses. These hoses carry water and solution. Loose hose connections cause leaks. Sometimes, a clamp might loosen. Check all visible hose connections. Gently push them to ensure they are secure. You might need a screwdriver for some clamps.

The hose from the clean water tank to the pump can loosen. The hose from the suction nozzle to the dirty water tank can also become loose. Ensure all connections are tight. A secure connection keeps water inside the cleaner. This prevents any drips or puddles.

### Inspecting for Cracks or Damage

Physical damage can cause leaks. Small cracks in plastic tanks or housing can allow water to escape. Carefully inspect both the clean and dirty water tanks. Look for hairline cracks. Also, check the main body of the cleaner. Pay special attention to the bottom.

If you find a crack in a tank, you will need a new tank. Plastic cement might offer a temporary fix. However, a full tank creates pressure. This pressure will likely make the temporary fix fail. Replacing the damaged part is the best solution. This prevents future leaks.

## Troubleshooting Non-Spinning Brushes

The brush roll helps deep clean carpets. If the brushes on your Hoover Smartwash stop spinning, it will not clean well. This problem can result from a few different issues. Often, it is an easy fix. Let's look at common causes.

### Clearing Obstructions from Brush Roll Area

Hair, string, and carpet fibers can wrap around the brush roll. This acts like a brake. It stops the brushes from spinning freely. Over time, this build-up becomes very tight. It can even prevent the motor from turning the brush.

Unplug the cleaner before you do anything. Turn the unit over. You will see the brush roll on the bottom. Use scissors or a utility knife to carefully cut away any wrapped hair or debris. Pull it all off. Spin the brush roll by hand. It should turn easily. A clean brush roll spins better. This helps the machine clean deeply.

### Inspecting the Brush Belt

The brush roll connects to the motor with a belt. This belt drives the brush. If the belt is broken, stretched, or slipped off, the brushes will not spin. A broken belt means no movement. A stretched belt might make the brushes spin slowly or intermittently.

You might need to remove a bottom plate to access the belt. Refer to your user manual for instructions. Inspect the belt for damage. If it is broken, you need a replacement. If it is just slipped off, you can put it back on the pulleys. Ensure it fits snugly. Some Hoover models, like those mentioned in [Hoover Rug Shampooer Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/hoover-rug-shampooer-troubleshooting), share similar belt drive systems. So, the principles often carry over.

### Considering Motor Issues

Sometimes, the motor itself has a problem. This is less common. If the brush roll is clear and the belt is fine, the motor might be faulty. You might hear a humming sound, but no brush movement. Or, you might smell burning. These are signs of a motor problem.

Motor issues usually require professional repair. You can check if the motor spins by itself after removing the belt. If it does not, then it is likely a motor issue. For safety, do not attempt to repair the motor yourself. Contact Hoover customer service or a certified repair technician.

## Eliminating Foul Odors from Your Smartwash

Your carpet cleaner should make your home smell fresh. If your Hoover Smartwash produces a foul odor, it often means trapped dirt or mildew. This happens when dirty water or debris sits inside the machine. Proper cleaning prevents these smells.

### Thoroughly Cleaning Tanks and Hoses

The dirty water tank is the main source of odors. After each use, empty this tank immediately. Rinse it thoroughly with clean, warm water. Swish the water around to remove all residue. Let the tank air dry completely before storing it. Do not put a damp tank back on the machine.

The suction hose and internal pathways can also trap smelly grime. Flush clean water through the cleaner to rinse these parts. Run the cleaner with only clean water for a minute or two. This helps clear any lingering dirty water. Allowing parts to dry fully prevents mildew growth. For more general advice on maintaining your appliance and preventing odors, review articles on [how to clean your Hoover carpet cleaner](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hoover-carpet-cleaner).

### Disinfecting Brush Rolls and Nozzles

The brush roll agitates dirt. It can collect hair and debris. This debris can harbor bacteria and smell bad. The suction nozzle also collects residue. Clean these parts regularly. Unplug the cleaner. Remove the brush roll if possible. Wash it with warm, soapy water. Use a brush to scrub away built-up grime.

Clean the nozzle assembly as well. You can use a mild disinfectant solution. Make sure the solution is safe for plastics. Rinse all parts completely after cleaning. Allow them to air dry fully. A clean machine will smell fresh. This ensures your carpets smell good too.

## AutoMix and Solution Dispensing Inaccuracies

The Hoover Smartwash features AutoMix technology. This system automatically mixes water and solution. It takes the guesswork out of cleaning. If your cleaner is dispensing too much, too little, or no solution, the AutoMix system might need attention.

### Verifying Solution Type and Dilution

Your Hoover Smartwash is designed for specific cleaning solutions. Using the wrong type of solution can affect AutoMix. Thick solutions might not flow well. Always use Hoover brand cleaning formulas. These are formulated for your machine. Do not dilute solutions unless the bottle states it. AutoMix handles dilution.

Using non-foaming solutions is also important. Foamy solutions can confuse the sensor. They can also create excessive suds inside the machine. This can lead to poor suction and messy cleanups. Check your solution bottle carefully. Ensure it is the correct type.

### Cleaning AutoMix Sensor Area

The AutoMix system uses a sensor. This sensor detects the presence of solution. It also helps control the mix ratio. If this sensor gets dirty, it can send wrong signals. Residue from solutions or water mineral deposits can build up. This affects accuracy.

Locate the sensor area. It is usually near the clean water tank connection point. Unplug the machine. Use a soft, damp cloth to gently wipe the sensor. Do not use harsh chemicals. Ensure the area is clean and free of debris. This allows the sensor to work properly.

### Resetting the Unit for AutoMix Recalibration

Sometimes, the AutoMix system needs a reset. This can happen if the cleaner has been jostled or if the sensor briefly malfunctioned. A simple power cycle can often recalibrate the system. Unplug the Hoover Smartwash from the wall outlet. Wait for at least 15 minutes. This allows internal components to discharge and reset.

Plug the cleaner back in. Turn it on. Test the AutoMix function. Fill both tanks with the correct fluids. Run a small test pass on a discreet area of carpet. Observe if the solution dispenses correctly. This often restores the AutoMix to proper operation.
