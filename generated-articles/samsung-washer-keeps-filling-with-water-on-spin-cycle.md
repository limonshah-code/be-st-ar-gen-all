A Samsung washer keeps filling with water on spin cycle typically due to a clogged drain system, a faulty water inlet valve that fails to shut off, or a malfunctioning pressure sensor incorrectly detecting water levels. Inspect these components to identify the specific issue and restore normal operation.

## Understanding the Spin Cycle and Water Flow

The spin cycle is a critical phase of your wash. During this time, the washer removes water from clothes. The drum spins at high speed. Water drains out through the pump and hose. A Samsung washer keeps filling with water on spin cycle means something is wrong with this process.

The washer's control board manages this operation. It sends signals to various parts. These parts include the drain pump and the water inlet valve. When water fills instead of drains, it indicates a failure in these signals or the parts themselves. The washer believes it needs more water, even during spin. Or, water simply cannot leave the machine. This can lead to very wet clothes and possible overflowing.

Normal operation involves the drain pump activating. The water inlet valve should remain closed. The pressure sensor monitors the water level inside the drum. If any of these components malfunction, the washer cannot complete its cycle properly. We will discuss how each component affects the spin cycle. We will help you identify the specific cause. This prepares you to fix the problem.

## Clogged Drain Pump Filter or Hose

A common reason a Samsung washer keeps filling with water on spin cycle is a blockage. The drain pump filter or the drain hose can get clogged. These parts are responsible for removing water from the tub. If water cannot leave, new water might enter or simply accumulate. This issue prevents proper drainage.

### Inspecting the Drain Hose

The drain hose carries water from the washer to your standpipe or utility sink. First, check this hose for kinks. A simple bend can stop water flow. Straighten any kinks you find. Second, check if the hose end is too far down the standpipe. If it goes too deep, it can create a siphon effect. This pulls water back into the tub. The end of the hose should sit at least 30 inches above the floor. Ensure there is an air gap. This gap prevents dirty water from flowing back. This is crucial for proper drainage and preventing your washer from refilling.

If the hose is clear and properly positioned, then the issue might be inside. Debris can block the hose internally. You may need to disconnect the hose from the washer and the drain. Then, check for clogs. Use a flashlight to look inside. You can also try flushing water through it. This helps dislodge any obstructions. A clear drain hose ensures water can exit freely.

### Cleaning the Drain Pump Filter

The drain pump filter traps lint, coins, and other small items. These items would otherwise damage the drain pump. Over time, this filter collects a lot of debris. A heavily clogged filter restricts water flow. This prevents the washer from draining effectively. When water cannot drain, the washer may incorrectly try to add more water. This leads to the problem of a Samsung washer keeps filling with water on spin cycle.

Most Samsung washers have a drain pump filter located at the bottom front. It is usually behind a small access panel. Before opening it, place a shallow pan or towels underneath. Water will come out. Unscrew the cap slowly. Remove any debris you find. Clean the filter thoroughly under running water. Rinse away all lint and foreign objects. After cleaning, screw the filter back in firmly. Ensure it is tight to prevent leaks. Regularly cleaning this filter prevents many drainage problems. This simple task can often solve your issue quickly.

## Faulty Water Inlet Valve

The water inlet valve controls water entry into your Samsung washer. This valve opens to let water in during wash and rinse cycles. It closes to stop water flow at all other times, including the spin cycle. If your Samsung washer keeps filling with water on spin cycle, a faulty water inlet valve is a strong possibility. It means the valve is not closing completely. This allows water to trickle or flow continuously into the drum. Even when it should be draining.

Over time, sediment and mineral deposits can build up in the valve. This prevents it from sealing properly. The valve might also have an electrical defect. This defect keeps it partially open or causes it to open at the wrong time. You might hear a constant faint trickling sound from the washer even when it is off. This is a sign of a leaking inlet valve. This constant water flow prevents the spin cycle from working. It keeps the clothes wet.

### Testing the Water Inlet Valve

Testing the water inlet valve helps confirm if it is faulty. First, disconnect power to your washer for safety. Locate the water inlet valve at the back of the washer. It is where the water supply hoses connect. There are usually two valves: one for hot water and one for cold. Feel the solenoid coils on the valve. If one coil is warm when the washer is off and no cycle is running, it might be stuck open. You can also disconnect the electrical connectors to the valve solenoids. If the water stops flowing, the valve itself is likely good. The problem might be with the control board sending constant power.

However, if water continues to fill even with the power disconnected from the valve solenoids, the valve is mechanically stuck open. In this case, you need to replace the valve assembly. Replacing a faulty water inlet valve is a common repair. It is often manageable for a DIY enthusiast. This component is essential for proper water management in your washer. Correcting this issue stops the continuous water flow.

Our [Samsung VRT Plus washer troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/samsung-vrt-plus-washer-troubleshooting) guide also offers relevant insights into general Samsung washer issues.

## Malfunctioning Pressure Sensor or Air Dome Hose

Your Samsung washer relies on a pressure sensor. This sensor accurately detects the water level inside the drum. It sends signals to the control board. The control board uses these signals to manage water intake and drainage. If the pressure sensor malfunctions, it might incorrectly tell the washer that the water level is low. This happens even when the drum is full or overfilling. This false reading causes the washer to keep adding water. This can happen during any cycle, including the spin cycle. If your Samsung washer keeps filling with water on spin cycle, this sensor is a key suspect.

The pressure sensor connects to an air dome hose. This hose runs from the sensor to the bottom of the washer tub. Air pressure changes in this hose as the water level rises. The sensor reads these pressure changes. If the sensor or its hose is faulty, the washer receives incorrect information. This leads to overfilling or continuous filling.

### Checking the Pressure Sensor

Accessing the pressure sensor typically requires removing the washer's top panel. Once exposed, locate the small, round sensor. It usually has a thin hose connected to it. Check the electrical connections to the sensor. Ensure they are secure. A loose connection can cause erratic readings. You can use a multimeter to test the sensor's resistance, but this often requires specific specifications. If you suspect the sensor, and other issues are ruled out, replacement is often the next step. A faulty pressure sensor sends wrong signals. This makes the washer add water when it should not. This causes your Samsung washer to keep filling with water on spin cycle.

### Clearing the Air Dome Hose

The air dome hose is critical for the pressure sensor's function. It can become clogged with detergent residue, lint, or mildew. This blockage prevents accurate air pressure changes. The sensor cannot read the water level correctly. To check it, disconnect the hose from both the sensor and the tub. Blow air through the hose. If you feel resistance or hear no clear airflow, the hose is clogged. You can use a thin wire or a pipe cleaner to dislodge obstructions. You can also flush it with water. Ensure the hose is completely dry before reattaching it. A clear air dome hose helps the pressure sensor work correctly. This ensures your washer fills water only when needed.

## Defective Drain Pump

The drain pump is responsible for expelling water from the washer tub. It actively pumps water out during the drain and spin cycles. If your Samsung washer keeps filling with water on spin cycle, it could be a sign of a defective drain pump. A faulty pump cannot remove water effectively. Even if the water inlet valve is closed, the existing water in the tub remains. This can confuse the washer's system. It might try to re-initiate drainage or even add more water. This is because the water level sensor might not detect proper drainage.

A drain pump can fail for several reasons. It might be mechanically damaged, or its motor could burn out. Sometimes, small objects bypass the filter and get stuck in the pump impeller. This prevents the impeller from spinning. This makes the pump unable to move water. You might hear a humming sound from the washer during the drain cycle. This hum indicates the pump motor is trying to work. But no water leaves the machine. This is a common symptom of a clogged or failed pump.

### Testing the Drain Pump

Testing the drain pump involves a few steps. First, disconnect power to the washer. Then, access the drain pump. It is usually located at the bottom front or back of the washer. Look for any visible obstructions around the impeller. Sometimes, a sock or a coin gets caught. Clear any debris. Next, check the electrical connections to the pump motor. Ensure they are secure. You can use a multimeter to test the pump motor for continuity. If there is no continuity, the motor is likely bad.

You can also try a direct power test. However, this requires electrical knowledge and extreme caution. If the pump does not run or makes unusual noises during a test cycle, it likely needs replacement. A fully functional drain pump is essential for preventing water accumulation. This ensures proper spin cycles. Resolving a drain pump issue directly addresses the problem of your Samsung washer filling with water on spin cycle.

A new, working drain pump will ensure your washer drains water correctly. This prevents the recurring problem of your Samsung washer filling with water on spin cycle. It restores your machine's full functionality.

## Control Board Issues (Main PCB)

The main control board, or Main PCB, is the brain of your Samsung washer. It sends commands to every component. This includes the water inlet valve, the drain pump, and the motor. If the Samsung washer keeps filling with water on spin cycle, a malfunctioning control board could be the culprit. A faulty board might send continuous power to the water inlet valve. This tells it to stay open. Or, it might fail to activate the drain pump. It could also misinterpret signals from the pressure sensor. These errors lead to the washer overfilling or not draining correctly during the spin cycle.

Control board issues can manifest as erratic behavior. The washer might stop mid-cycle, display error codes, or simply not respond as expected. Sometimes, power surges or electrical faults can damage the board. You might see burn marks or blown components on the board itself. However, often the damage is internal and not visible.

### Resetting the Washer

Before considering a replacement, try resetting the washer. A simple reset can sometimes clear minor glitches in the control board's software. To reset most Samsung washers, unplug the appliance from the wall outlet. Wait for about 5-10 minutes. Then, plug it back in. This completely cuts power to the control board. It allows its internal memory to clear. After resetting, try running a short cycle. See if the problem persists. This simple step often resolves temporary electronic malfunctions. It is a quick and easy first troubleshooting step for many washer issues.
