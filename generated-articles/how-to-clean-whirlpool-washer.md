## Keep Your Laundry Fresh: How To Clean Your Whirlpool Washer

Is your laundry not smelling as fresh as it once did? Perhaps your Whirlpool washer is the culprit. Washing machines can develop unpleasant odors and grime over time. This happens due to residue from detergent, fabric softener, and dirt from clothes. A dirty washer can transfer grime back onto your clean laundry.

Maintaining a clean washing machine is important for its efficiency and the cleanliness of your clothes. This comprehensive guide will show you exactly how to clean your Whirlpool washer. We cover both front-load and top-load models. You will learn the best methods for different parts of the machine. Get ready to banish odors and make your washer sparkle.

### Takeaway

*   **Clean Regularly:** Wipe down surfaces and leave the door open after each use.
*   **Deep Clean Monthly:** Run a cleaning cycle with a specialized cleaner or natural solutions.
*   **Target Components:** Pay attention to the gasket, dispenser, and filter.

### Clear, Concise Answer

To clean a Whirlpool washer, run a hot water cycle with a washer cleaner like Affresh, or use a mixture of white vinegar and baking soda. Additionally, wipe down the door gasket, clean the detergent dispenser, and periodically check the drain pump filter to remove trapped debris.

## Why Your Whirlpool Washer Needs Regular Cleaning

Your washing machine works hard to clean your clothes. Over time, it can accumulate grime. This buildup comes from detergent residue, fabric softener, and hard water minerals. These deposits can stick to the inside of the wash tub. They can also get into hoses and dispensers.

This residue creates a breeding ground for mold and mildew. Mold and mildew cause unpleasant odors. These smells can then transfer to your freshly washed laundry. A dirty washing machine also works less efficiently. Water may not drain properly, or detergent may not dispense well. Regular cleaning prevents these issues. It ensures your Whirlpool washer continues to perform its best. You save money on repairs and enjoy cleaner clothes. You can learn more about tackling specific odors by visiting our guide on [how to clean a washer smell](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-smell).

Forgetting to clean your washer leads to more than just bad smells. It can affect the machine's lifespan. Limescale and soap scum can clog internal components. This puts stress on the motor and other parts. Taking a little time for cleaning now saves you bigger problems later. A clean washer runs smoother and lasts longer.

## Essential Supplies for Cleaning Your Whirlpool Washer

Before you start cleaning, gather all necessary supplies. Having everything ready makes the process smoother. You probably have many of these items at home already. Using the right tools ensures a thorough and safe clean.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Washer Cleaner:** Affresh washing machine cleaner tablets are very effective. Whirlpool recommends them. You can also use other commercial washer cleaning products.
*   **White Vinegar:** This is a powerful natural cleaner. It helps dissolve mineral deposits and kills mold. Many people choose to [clean their washer with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-with-vinegar) as an alternative to commercial products.
*   **Baking Soda:** Baking soda helps absorb odors. It also provides a gentle abrasive action for scrubbing.
*   **Microfiber Cloths or Sponges:** These are good for wiping surfaces. They do not scratch your machine.
*   **Old Toothbrush or Small Brush:** Useful for scrubbing tight spots. Think dispenser trays and gasket folds.
*   **Spray Bottle:** For mixing and applying cleaning solutions.
*   **Warm Water:** For diluting cleaners and rinsing.
*   **Mild Dish Soap:** For cleaning the exterior and stubborn spots.
*   **Towel:** For drying surfaces after cleaning.

Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach on certain parts, especially rubber gaskets, as they can cause damage over time. Always check your Whirlpool owner's manual for specific cleaning recommendations and warnings.

## Step-by-Step: Cleaning the Whirlpool Washer Drum

Cleaning the washer drum is the most important step. This is where most of the grime builds up. The method varies slightly for different models. Both front-load and top-load Whirlpool washers have a "Clean Washer" cycle. Use this cycle if your machine has it.

### Using the "Clean Washer" Cycle (Recommended)

Many modern Whirlpool washers have a specific self-clean cycle. This cycle uses extra water and higher temperatures. It helps to deep clean the tub.

1.  **Empty the Washer:** Make sure no clothes are inside the drum.
2.  **Add Cleaner:** Place an Affresh tablet or other washer cleaner in the main detergent dispenser. Do not put it directly in the drum. If your model uses liquid cleaner, add it there.
3.  **Select Cycle:** Choose the "Clean Washer" or "Tub Clean" cycle.
4.  **Start Cycle:** Close the door and start the cycle. The machine will do the rest.
5.  **Wipe Down:** After the cycle finishes, wipe the inside of the drum with a clean cloth. This removes any loosened residue. Leave the door open for a few hours to air dry.

### Manual Deep Cleaning with Vinegar and Baking Soda

If your Whirlpool washer does not have a dedicated cleaning cycle, or if you prefer natural methods, use vinegar and baking soda. This method is effective for both odor and residue removal. It is also great if you want to know [how to clean a washer without Affresh](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-without-affresh).

1.  **First Cycle (Vinegar):**
    *   Set your washer to the hottest water setting.
    *   Choose the largest load size option.
    *   Add four cups of white vinegar directly into the detergent dispenser.
    *   Start the cycle. Let it run for a few minutes to mix the water and vinegar.
    *   Pause the cycle. Let the vinegar-water solution sit in the tub for one hour. This allows it to break down grime.
    *   Resume the cycle and let it complete.
2.  **Second Cycle (Baking Soda):**
    *   Keep the washer empty.
    *   Add one cup of baking soda to the detergent dispenser.
    *   Run another hot water cycle on the largest load setting.
    *   The baking soda will help neutralize any lingering odors. It also removes any remaining vinegar residue.
3.  **Final Wipe:** After the second cycle, wipe down the interior of the drum. Use a clean, damp cloth. Pay attention to any spots that still look dirty.

This two-step process effectively cleans the drum. It removes soap scum and leaves the interior fresh.

## Targeting Specific Areas: Gasket, Dispenser, and Exterior

Cleaning the drum is a major part of the job. However, other parts of your Whirlpool washer also need attention. These areas often harbor mold, mildew, and detergent buildup. Neglecting them can lead to recurring odors and inefficient operation.

### Cleaning the Front-Load Washer Gasket (Door Seal)

The rubber gasket around the door of a front-load Whirlpool washer is a common spot for mold and mildew. Water and detergent residue get trapped here. This area requires regular cleaning. For a detailed guide, you can refer to [how to clean front load washer gasket](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-front-load-washer-gasket).

1.  **Pull Back Folds:** Gently pull back the rubber folds of the gasket. Look for any debris, socks, or foreign objects. Remove them.
2.  **Prepare Cleaning Solution:** Mix a solution of equal parts white vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle. You can also use a mild bleach solution (1/4 cup bleach to 1 gallon water) for severe mold, but use sparingly.
3.  **Spray and Wipe:** Spray the solution generously onto the gasket. Focus on moldy areas. Let it sit for a few minutes.
4.  **Scrub and Rinse:** Use a microfiber cloth or an old toothbrush to scrub away the mold and grime. Wipe thoroughly.
5.  **Dry Completely:** After cleaning, dry the gasket completely with a clean towel. Leaving it wet encourages mold growth.

### Cleaning the Detergent Dispenser

The detergent dispenser can get gummy with built-up soap and fabric softener. This can block proper dispensing.

1.  **Remove Dispenser Tray:** Most Whirlpool dispenser trays are removable. Pull it out gently. Consult your manual if you are unsure.
2.  **Soak and Scrub:** Soak the tray in warm, soapy water for 15-20 minutes. Use a small brush or old toothbrush to scrub away any residue.
3.  **Rinse and Dry:** Rinse the tray thoroughly under running water. Make sure all soap is gone. Dry it completely before putting it back.
4.  **Clean Dispenser Housing:** Use a damp cloth to wipe inside the dispenser housing on the machine. This removes any spills or drips.

### Cleaning the Exterior of Your Whirlpool Washer

The outside of your washer needs cleaning too. Dust, spills, and fingerprints can accumulate.

1.  **Wipe Down:** Use a soft, damp cloth with a mild all-purpose cleaner. Wipe down the top, sides, and front of the machine.
2.  **Control Panel:** For the control panel, spray cleaner onto your cloth first. Then, gently wipe the panel. Avoid spraying directly onto electronics.
3.  **Polish:** For a streak-free shine, wipe with a dry microfiber cloth after cleaning.

Regularly cleaning these external parts keeps your laundry area looking neat. It also prevents dirt from getting inside the machine.

## Maintaining Optimal Performance: Cleaning the Drain Pump Filter

Many Whirlpool washers have a drain pump filter. This filter catches lint, coins, and other small items before they reach the pump. A clogged filter can cause drainage issues. It can also lead to strange noises or odors from your washer. Cleaning this filter is vital for the machine's longevity and performance.

The location of the drain pump filter varies. It is usually found at the bottom front of the machine. Look for a small access panel or a small door. Check your Whirlpool owner's manual if you cannot find it. For specific Whirlpool Cabrio models, you can find more information on [how to clean Whirlpool Cabrio washer filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-whirlpool-cabrio-washer-filter).

Here are the steps to clean it:

1.  **Prepare for Water:** Place a shallow pan or old towels under the filter access door. Some water will likely drain out when you open it.
2.  **Open Access Panel:** Open the small access panel. You might need a flathead screwdriver to gently pry it open.
3.  **Unscrew Filter:** Slowly unscrew the filter by turning it counter-clockwise. Be ready for water to come out.
4.  **Remove Debris:** Pull the filter out completely. Remove any lint, hair, coins, or other foreign objects stuck to it. You might be surprised by what you find!
5.  **Rinse Filter:** Rinse the filter under running water. Use an old toothbrush to scrub away any stubborn grime.
6.  **Clean Housing:** Use a damp cloth to wipe inside the filter housing. Check for any remaining debris.
7.  **Reinstall Filter:** Screw the clean filter back into place clockwise until it is tight. Close the access panel.

Clean this filter every few months, or more often if you notice drainage problems. This simple task significantly extends the life of your washer. It also prevents costly repairs.

## Deep Dive: Cleaning a Whirlpool Washer with an Agitator (Top-Load Specific)

Whirlpool top-load washers, especially older models, often feature a central agitator. This part helps move clothes during the wash cycle. Just like the drum, the agitator can accumulate soap scum and residue. Cleaning it ensures thorough agitation and prevents dirt transfer. Many of the general cleaning steps apply to top-loaders. However, the agitator needs specific attention. You can find more general guidance on how to clean a washer with an agitator in our article on [how to clean washer agitator](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-agitator).

### Cleaning the Agitator Itself

The agitator itself can be wiped down. Sometimes, the top cap of the agitator can be removed. This reveals more hidden grime.

1.  **Examine Agitator:** Look closely at the agitator. Check for any visible dirt or residue.
2.  **Remove Agitator Cap (If Possible):** Some agitators have a removable fabric softener dispenser cap or a central cap. Twist or pull this off gently. This often reveals a bolt or a hollow space where lint and grime accumulate.
3.  **Wipe and Scrub:** Use a damp cloth and mild all-purpose cleaner to wipe down the agitator. For stubborn spots, use an old toothbrush. Pay attention to the underside of the cap and inside the agitator column if removable.
4.  **Rinse and Reassemble:** Rinse away any cleaning solution. Make sure all parts are dry before reassembling.

### Top-Load Washer Tub Cleaning with Agitator

The process for cleaning the tub of a top-load agitator washer is similar to drum cleaning.

1.  **Fill with Hot Water:** Start a hot water cycle on the largest load setting. Let the tub fill completely with water.
2.  **Add Cleaner:** Once the tub is full, add four cups of white vinegar. Pour it directly into the water.
3.  **Agitate and Soak:** Let the machine agitate for a few minutes. Then, pause the cycle. Allow the vinegar solution to soak in the tub for at least an hour. This helps break down soap scum and mineral deposits.
4.  **Complete Cycle:** Resume the cycle and let it finish.
5.  **Second Rinse (Optional but Recommended):** For extra freshness, add one cup of baking soda to the empty tub. Run another full hot water cycle. This neutralizes any remaining vinegar smell.
6.  **Wipe Down:** After both cycles, use a clean cloth to wipe down the entire interior of the tub. Pay special attention to the area around the agitator. Remove any loosened grime.

Regularly cleaning the agitator and tub ensures your top-load Whirlpool washer remains efficient. It prevents dirty clothes and unpleasant smells.

## Preventative Measures: Keeping Your Whirlpool Washer Clean Long-Term

Cleaning your Whirlpool washer thoroughly is a great start. But the key to keeping it fresh is consistent maintenance. Small habits can make a big difference. These simple steps will prevent future grime and odors from building up. They ensure your machine stays in top condition between deep cleans.

### After Each Use

These habits take only a few seconds. They significantly reduce moisture and residue buildup.

*   **Leave the Door Open:** After every wash cycle, leave the washer door or lid ajar. This allows air to circulate inside the drum. It helps the interior dry completely. This is crucial for preventing mold and mildew growth.
*   **Wipe Down Gasket (Front-Load):** For front-load washers, quickly wipe the rubber gasket with a dry cloth. This removes trapped moisture and lint. It prevents mildew from forming in this common problem area.
*   **Remove Detergent Drawer:** If your dispenser is easily removable, take it out and let it air dry after a few washes. This prevents sticky residue buildup.

### Weekly Maintenance

A quick weekly check can stop minor issues from becoming major problems.

*   **Wipe Dispenser Area:** Even if you don't remove the drawer, quickly wipe down the dispenser area. Use a damp cloth to remove any visible detergent or fabric softener residue.
*   **Quick Wipe of Exterior:** Give the outside of your washer a quick wipe down. Use a damp cloth to remove dust and smudges. This keeps your laundry area tidy.

### Monthly Maintenance

These tasks should be part of your routine once a month.

*   **Run a Cleaning Cycle:** Use the "Clean Washer" cycle with an Affresh tablet or a vinegar/baking soda solution. This is the most important step for internal cleanliness.
*   **Inspect and Clean Gasket:** Do a more thorough inspection and cleaning of the front-load washer gasket. Pull back all folds and scrub as needed.
*   **Check Drain Pump Filter:** Clean the drain pump filter every 1-3 months. This prevents clogs and ensures proper drainage.

By following these preventative measures, you extend the life of your Whirlpool washer. You also ensure your clothes always come out smelling clean and fresh. Regular maintenance saves time and money in the long run.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: How often should I clean my Whirlpool washer?
A1: You should deep clean your Whirlpool washer at least once a month. If you wash frequently, or if you notice odors, clean it every two to three weeks. Wiping down the gasket and leaving the door open after each use helps a lot with daily maintenance.

### Q2: Can I use bleach to clean my Whirlpool washer?
A2: Yes, you can use bleach for a deep clean, but with caution. Add 1/2 cup of liquid bleach to the dispenser and run a hot water cycle. Avoid using bleach on the rubber gasket too often as it can degrade the material. Always rinse thoroughly after using bleach.

### Q3: Why does my Whirlpool washer smell like mildew?
A3: Mildew smell comes from mold and bacteria growing in damp, dark areas. This often happens in the drum, gasket, or detergent dispenser where water and detergent residue collect. Regular cleaning, thorough drying, and leaving the door open can prevent this issue.

### Q4: My clothes still smell after cleaning the washer. What's wrong?
A4: If clothes still smell, ensure you cleaned all parts, especially the drain pump filter and the gasket. Overloading the machine, using too much detergent, or not drying clothes promptly can also cause lingering odors. Check your home's water quality and drainage system.

### Q5: How do I clean a top-load Whirlpool washer without an agitator?
A5: Cleaning a top-load Whirlpool washer without an agitator (often called an impeller model) follows similar steps to a front-loader. Use the "Clean Washer" cycle if available, or run a hot water cycle with vinegar and baking soda. Wipe down the drum thoroughly after the cycle.

### Q6: Can I use dish soap to clean my washer?
A6: You can use a small amount of mild dish soap diluted in water to clean the exterior surfaces and removable dispenser trays. However, avoid using large amounts of dish soap inside the washer drum for cleaning cycles, as it can create too many suds and residue. Stick to specialized washer cleaners, vinegar, or baking soda for internal cleaning.
