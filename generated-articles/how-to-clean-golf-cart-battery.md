## Understanding Golf Cart Battery Basics

Golf cart batteries are complex components vital for vehicle operation. Most golf carts use deep-cycle lead-acid batteries. These batteries provide a steady current over a long period. They are designed for repeated deep discharges and recharges.

Battery packs in golf carts typically consist of multiple individual batteries connected in series. This connection increases the total voltage. Common setups include 36-volt or 48-volt systems. Each individual battery contributes to the overall power. For example, a 48-volt system might use six 8-volt batteries.

Battery terminals are points where electrical cables connect. These terminals are crucial for power flow. Corrosion often forms on these terminals. This corrosion looks like a white, blue, or green powdery substance. It forms when battery acid reacts with the metal terminals or surrounding surfaces. This reaction creates an insulating layer.

This layer hinders the flow of electricity. It reduces battery efficiency and overall cart performance. Understanding these basics helps you clean your golf cart battery effectively. It also helps you appreciate why regular cleaning is so important for golf cart health.
