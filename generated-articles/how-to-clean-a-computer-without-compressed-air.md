## Cleaning the External Components

Before you tackle the inside, clean the outside. External cleaning is simpler. It keeps your workspace tidy. It also improves your computer's appearance. Dust on the outside can still find its way in.

**1. Keyboard Cleaning:**
Keyboards collect a lot of dirt. Food crumbs, skin flakes, and dust get trapped between keys.
*   First, turn your keyboard upside down. Gently shake it. This loosens large debris.
*   Next, use a soft-bristle brush. Brush between the keys. Sweep dust towards the edge.
*   Take a microfiber cloth. Dampen it slightly with isopropyl alcohol (not water). Wipe down the keycaps and the keyboard surface. Alcohol evaporates fast. It disinfects too.
*   For really stubborn spots, use a cotton swab. Dip it in isopropyl alcohol. Clean around each key.
*   For more detailed steps, check our guide on [how to clean a computer keyboard](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-computer-keyboard).

**2. Mouse Cleaning:**
Mice get grimy from hand contact. Dirt can affect tracking performance.
*   Unplug your mouse.
*   Use a microfiber cloth dampened with isopropyl alcohol. Wipe the entire surface.
*   For the scroll wheel, use a cotton swab. Clean all sides of the wheel.
*   If your mouse has an optical sensor, gently wipe it with a dry cotton swab. Be careful not to scratch it.
*   Learn more about mouse cleaning in our article on [how to clean a computer mouse](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-computer-mouse).

**3. Monitor Cleaning:**
Your screen can get dusty and smudged. Use the right technique to avoid streaks.
*   Turn off your monitor. A black screen shows dust and smudges better.
*   First, gently wipe the screen with a dry microfiber cloth. Use light, circular motions. This removes loose dust.
*   For smudges, use a screen-specific cleaning solution. Spray it onto the microfiber cloth, not directly on the screen.
*   Wipe the screen again with the damp cloth. Continue with light, circular motions.
*   For best results and no streaks, see our advice on [how to clean a computer monitor](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-computer-monitor) and [how to clean a computer screen without streaks](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-computer-screen-without-streaks). Never use harsh chemicals.

**4. Case Exterior:**
The computer case itself collects dust.
*   Use a microfiber cloth. Wipe down all external surfaces of the case.
*   For vents, use a soft brush to dislodge dust. Then wipe it away.
*   You can lightly dampen the cloth with isopropyl alcohol for greasy spots.

Clean external components first. This prevents dust from spreading. It also gives you a clean base for internal work.

## Safely Opening and Preparing Your Computer

Cleaning the inside of your computer requires care. Safety is the top priority. Static electricity can damage sensitive components. Always take precautions.

**1. Power Down Completely:**
This step is critical.
*   Save all your work. Close all programs.
*   Shut down your computer properly. Do not just put it to sleep.
*   Once it is off, unplug the power cable from the wall outlet.
*   Unplug all peripheral devices too. Remove the mouse, keyboard, monitor cables, and any USB devices. This includes network cables.

**2. Ground Yourself:**
Static electricity is a silent killer for computer parts. You must discharge any static built up on your body.
*   The best way is to wear an anti-static wrist strap. Attach one end to your wrist. Clip the other end to an unpainted metal part of your computer case. This creates a continuous path for static to drain.
*   If you do not have a wrist strap, touch a metal object like a doorknob before touching your computer. Then, periodically touch an unpainted metal part of your computer case while you work. This helps to ground yourself.
*   Work on a hard, non-carpeted surface. Carpet generates a lot of static.

**3. Open Your Computer Case:**
How you open your computer depends on its type.
*   **Desktop PC:** Most desktop cases have screws on the back. Loosen these screws to remove a side panel. Some cases have thumb screws for easier access. Gently slide or lift the panel off. Take note of how it came off for reassembly.
*   **Laptop:** Laptops are harder to open. Many have screws on the bottom panel. Some might hide screws under rubber feet. Use the correct screwdriver. Be gentle. Some panels have plastic clips. Avoid forcing them. Refer to your laptop's manual or an online guide specific to your model. I recommend starting with desktops if you are new to internal cleaning.

**4. Prepare Your Workspace:**
*   Lay out a clean, flat surface. A table is ideal.

*   Have a small container for screws. This prevents losing them.

Following these steps ensures a safe cleaning process. It protects both you and your computer's valuable components. Never rush this preparation stage.

## Tackling Internal Dust: Fans and Heatsinks

Internal dust is the main reason for computer performance issues. Fans and heatsinks are dust magnets. They pull air through the system. This means they filter out dust. Cleaning these parts is very important. You can do this effectively without compressed air.

**1. Cleaning Case Fans:**
Your computer has fans pushing air in and out.
*   Locate all case fans. They are usually on the front, back, top, or bottom of the case.
*   Use a soft-bristle brush. Gently brush the dust off the fan blades. Brush towards the outside of the case.
*   Hold the fan blades still while brushing. This prevents the fan from spinning too fast. Spinning it can generate static or damage the motor.
*   After brushing, use a low-power handheld vacuum. Carefully hover the nozzle near the dust you loosened. Suck it up. Do not touch the components with the vacuum.
*   You can also use a microfiber cloth to wipe the fan housing.

**2. Cleaning CPU Fan and Heatsink:**
The CPU cooler keeps your main processor cool. It often has a fan on top of a metal heatsink.
*   First, gently remove any dust from the CPU fan blades using a soft brush. Again, hold the blades still.
*   The heatsink has many thin fins. Dust gets trapped between these fins.
*   Use your soft brush to carefully sweep dust out from between the fins. Brush in the direction of the fins.
*   A cotton swab can help reach deeper into the fins. Be gentle.
*   You can use the low-power vacuum to collect the loosened dust.
*   For more detailed instructions on cleaning these critical components, read our guide on [how to clean a computer fan](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-computer-fan). It provides excellent techniques.

**3. Cleaning GPU Fan and Heatsink:**
Your graphics card (GPU) also has fans and heatsinks. They are very important for gaming or video editing.
*   Similar to the CPU cooler, use a soft brush for the GPU fan blades. Hold them still.
*   Brush dust out of the GPU heatsink fins. Be extra careful here. GPU heatsinks can be delicate.
*   A small cotton swab can help reach tight spots on the GPU cooler.
*   Follow up with the low-power vacuum to remove loosened dust.

Cleaning fans and heatsinks is vital. It restores proper airflow. This prevents overheating. Your computer will run quieter and perform better.

## Cleaning Other Internal Components

Once the fans and heatsinks are clean, move to other parts. These areas also collect dust. Being gentle is key here.

**1. Motherboard and Circuit Boards:**
The motherboard is your computer's brain. All components connect to it.
*   Use a soft-bristle anti-static brush. Gently sweep dust off the surface of the motherboard.
*   Brush around chips, capacitors, and connectors. Do not press hard.
*   Avoid touching components directly with your fingers. Use the brush.
*   For very small nooks, a dry cotton swab can work.
*   Do not use any liquids on the motherboard unless specifically instructed and with extreme caution. Isopropyl alcohol can be used on very specific, small, non-powered electrical contacts, but generally keep liquids away from the main board.

**2. RAM Sticks:**
RAM (Random Access Memory) modules sit in slots on the motherboard.
*   Dust can settle on the RAM sticks themselves.
*   Use your soft brush to gently dust off the RAM modules.
*   If you decide to remove RAM (only if necessary for thorough cleaning), handle them by the edges. Avoid touching the gold contacts. Brush dust out of the RAM slots too. Reinsert them firmly.

**3. Graphics Card (Beyond the Cooler):**
If you removed your graphics card for better access, clean the card itself.
*   Gently brush the entire circuit board of the graphics card.
*   Pay attention to the PCIe connector (the gold contacts). You can carefully wipe these contacts with a cotton swab lightly dampened with 99% isopropyl alcohol if they look dirty. Let it dry completely before reinserting.

**4. Power Supply Unit (PSU):**
The PSU supplies power to all components. It often has its own fan.
*   Most PSUs are enclosed. Do not open the PSU casing. There are dangerous capacitors inside that can hold a charge even after unplugging.
*   Focus on the external vents and fan opening. Use a soft brush to clear dust from these areas.
*   You can use the low-power vacuum to suck away loosened dust from the PSU's external vents.

**5. Drive Bays and Cable Management:**
Hard drives and SSDs often sit in bays. Cables run throughout the case.
*   Dust collects on drive surfaces and tangled cables.
*   Use your soft brush to dust off hard drives and SSDs.
*   Gently brush dust off power and data cables.
*   A low-power vacuum can help collect the dust here.

Always work slowly and methodically. Avoid forcing anything. Your computer's internal components are delicate. A patient, thorough cleaning ensures longevity and top performance for your machine.
