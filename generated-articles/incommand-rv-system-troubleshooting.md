The InCommand RV system is a digital hub for your entire recreational vehicle. It allows you to control many functions from a central touchscreen display or a mobile app. This includes your lights, climate control, slide-outs, awnings, and even tank levels. This integrated system relies on a main display, various control modules spread throughout your RV, and wiring that connects everything.

Each module manages specific components, sending information back to the main display. This setup gives you great convenience. It means less running around to flip switches. It also offers remote control capabilities through your smartphone. Understanding this architecture is the first step in effective InCommand RV system troubleshooting. You need to know how these parts interact to pinpoint problems.

This system aims to simplify RV living. It replaces many individual switches with a modern interface. For example, you can extend your awning with a tap on the screen. Or you can adjust the thermostat from your bed. When things go wrong, the issue might be with the display itself, a specific module, the wiring, or even the app on your phone. We will look at each of these possibilities.

Knowing how the InCommand system works helps you diagnose issues faster. You can determine if a problem is system-wide or isolated to one function. This knowledge saves you time and frustration. It helps you decide if you can fix it yourself or if you need professional help.

### Basic Troubleshooting Steps: The First Checks

Before you dive into complex fixes, always start with basic troubleshooting. Many InCommand RV system issues stem from simple problems. A quick power cycle can often resolve minor glitches. Think of it like restarting your computer when it acts up. This simple step clears temporary errors and refreshes the system.

First, try a soft reset. Turn the InCommand display off and then on again. Sometimes, this is all it takes to fix an unresponsive screen or a frozen menu. If that does not work, move to a hard reset. Locate your RV's 12V disconnect switch or battery cutoff. Turn off the main 12V power to the RV for a few minutes. This completely de-energizes the InCommand system and its modules. After a few minutes, restore the 12V power. Then, allow the InCommand system to boot up fully.

Next, check your fuses. The InCommand system, along with its individual modules, relies on fuses for protection. A blown fuse can cause an entire section of your RV to lose control through the InCommand system. Consult your RV's owner's manual or the InCommand manual for fuse box locations and diagrams. Look for fuses labeled for the InCommand system or for specific components that are not working. For example, if your RV furnace is not responding via InCommand, check its fuse.

Visually inspect each fuse. A blown fuse will show a broken wire inside. Replace any blown fuses with a new one of the exact same amperage rating. Never use a higher amperage fuse, as this can cause damage. Also, check your RV's main circuit breakers. Ensure none have tripped. Sometimes, a tripped breaker can cut power to a whole circuit, affecting InCommand's control over those components.

### Addressing Power and Screen Issues

A blank screen or an unresponsive touchscreen is one of the most common and frustrating InCommand RV system problems. When your main control panel goes dark, you lose command over your RV's essential functions. Start by ensuring the InCommand display itself is receiving power. Check the wiring connections at the back of the display. Make sure they are secure and free of corrosion. Sometimes, a loose connector is all that is preventing power flow.

Next, confirm your RV's main 12V battery system is charged and functioning correctly. An InCommand system needs stable voltage to operate. If your RV batteries are low, the InCommand display might dim, flicker, or fail to power on entirely. Check your battery voltage with a multimeter. Ensure it is at an acceptable level, typically above 12V. You may need to charge your batteries or check your converter if the voltage is low.

If the screen is on but unresponsive to touch, try a system reset as described in the previous section. This can often resolve software glitches. If the problem persists, the issue might be with the touchscreen digitizer itself. This is a hardware problem. In such cases, contact ASA Electronics or your RV dealer. They can guide you on potential repairs or replacements. You might also find similar display issues with other complex systems. For example, issues with a smart faucet might require [U by Moen troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/u-by-moen-troubleshooting) if its display goes blank.

Also, consider ambient temperature. Extreme cold or heat can sometimes affect electronic displays. Allow your RV interior to reach a moderate temperature. Then, try the InCommand system again. If the display shows error codes, consult your InCommand user manual immediately. Error codes are specific messages. They tell you exactly what system part is having a problem. Document any codes you see. This information is valuable for further troubleshooting or when speaking to technical support.

### Solving Connectivity and App Problems

Many InCommand RV owners rely on the mobile app for remote control and monitoring. When the app fails to connect or synchronize, it limits the convenience of your smart RV. Connectivity issues can stem from various sources. These include Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or even problems with your smartphone. We will break down common problems and solutions.

First, ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your mobile device. Also, confirm the InCommand system's Bluetooth is active. You can usually check this setting on the InCommand display itself. Some RV models require the main display to be powered on and active for app connectivity. Try restarting your phone or tablet. Then, close the InCommand app completely and reopen it. This can clear temporary software bugs. If your phone or tablet has an old operating system, consider updating it. Outdated software can sometimes cause compatibility issues.

Next, check your Wi-Fi connection. While many InCommand functions use Bluetooth, some might rely on a local Wi-Fi network within your RV. Ensure your RV's Wi-Fi router (if equipped) is working correctly. Your phone needs to be connected to this network. If you are using your phone's cellular data, make sure you have a strong signal. The InCommand app might need an internet connection for updates or to access cloud-based features.

If the app still struggles to connect, try unpairing and re-pairing your device with the InCommand system. This process clears the existing connection and establishes a new one. On your phone, go to your Bluetooth settings and "forget" the InCommand device. Then, on the InCommand display, put it into pairing mode. Follow the instructions to re-pair your phone. If all else fails, consider uninstalling the InCommand app from your phone. Then, reinstall it from your app store. This ensures you have the latest version. This fresh install can often resolve deep-seated app issues.

Finally, confirm your InCommand system's software is up to date. Occasionally, software bugs can cause connectivity problems. Manufacturers release updates to fix these. Check your InCommand manual or ASA Electronics' website for instructions on how to check for and apply software updates. This helps ensure optimal performance.

### Fixing Component Control Failures

The InCommand system controls a wide array of RV components. This includes your lighting, slide-outs, awnings, and climate control. When one of these components stops responding to InCommand commands, it is crucial to isolate the problem. The issue might not be with InCommand itself. It could be with the specific component or its dedicated module or wiring.

Start by trying to control the component manually, if an override switch exists. For example, some slide-outs or awnings have physical buttons. If the component works manually but not via InCommand, the problem lies with the InCommand system or its connection to that component. If it does not work manually either, the component itself or its direct power supply is likely the issue. For example, if your RV air conditioner is not working, you might need to perform [Dometic RV air conditioner troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/dometic-rv-air-conditioner-troubleshooting) before blaming InCommand. Similarly, if your water heater does not respond, consult your [Suburban RV water heater troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/suburban-rv-water-heater-troubleshooting) guide.

Next, check the specific control module for the malfunctioning component. InCommand systems use multiple modules, each managing different parts of the RV. Locate the module associated with the problematic component. Inspect its wiring connections. Ensure they are firmly seated and free of corrosion. Also, check any fuses located on the module itself or in its immediate vicinity. A small, dedicated fuse for that module can often blow.

If you suspect a sensor problem, like with climate control, ensure the sensor is clean and unobstructed. A dirty or blocked sensor can send incorrect readings to InCommand. This causes the system to react improperly. For instance, if your AC runs constantly, the temperature sensor might be reading incorrectly.

Finally, perform a system reset on the InCommand system. This can sometimes re-establish communication between the main display and the component's module. If the problem persists after these steps, it might indicate a fault in the module itself or deeper wiring issues. This could require professional diagnosis.

### Tank Monitoring and Sensor Calibration

Inaccurate tank level readings are a common complaint among RV owners. Your InCommand system typically displays levels for fresh, gray, and black water tanks. When these readings are incorrect, it can lead to overfilling or unexpectedly running out of water. The problem usually lies with the sensors inside the tanks, not the InCommand display itself.

RV tank sensors work by detecting the presence of liquid. Over time, residue, waste, or debris can build up on these sensors. This build-up creates a false reading. For instance, if your black tank always reads full, even after dumping, it is very likely sensor fouling. Similarly, a gray tank might show half-full due to soap scum. The first step is to clean your RV tanks thoroughly. For the black tank, this involves specific flushing procedures. You can find detailed steps on [how to clean an RV black tank](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-rv-black-tank). Using tank cleaning chemicals and ample flushing helps remove sensor build-up.

Once the tanks are clean, you may need to recalibrate the InCommand system's tank sensors. The calibration process "teaches" the system what an empty and full tank looks like. The exact steps for calibration vary by InCommand model and RV manufacturer. Consult your InCommand user manual or your RV owner's manual for specific instructions. Generally, this involves filling and emptying tanks while the InCommand system records the levels.

If cleaning and calibration do not resolve the issue, the sensors themselves might be faulty. RV tank sensors are often simple probes. They can corrode or become damaged over time. Replacing individual sensors can be a complex task, sometimes requiring tank removal or access through small openings. This often falls into the realm of professional repair.

Ensure all wiring connections from the tank sensors to their respective InCommand modules are secure. A loose or corroded wire can also cause erratic readings. Regularly flushing your tanks and using appropriate tank treatments can prevent sensor issues. This ensures accurate readings for your convenience.
