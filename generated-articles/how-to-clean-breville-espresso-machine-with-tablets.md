## Clean Your Breville Espresso Machine with Tablets for Best Coffee

There is nothing quite like a fresh cup of espresso to start your day. Many people love Breville espresso machines for making delicious coffee at home. To keep your machine making great espresso, you must clean it often. Cleaning your Breville espresso machine with tablets is simple and very important.

This guide will show you how to use cleaning tablets effectively. We will discuss why regular cleaning helps your coffee taste better. We will also cover the steps for a thorough cleaning. You will learn about the different types of cleaning and how to know when your machine needs attention. By following these steps, you will enjoy perfect espresso for years.

### Takeaway

*   Use specialized cleaning tablets for your Breville machine.
*   Follow your machine's specific cleaning cycle instructions.
*   Regular cleaning prevents coffee oil buildup and ensures great taste.
*   Clean your machine every 200 shots or when the 'CLEAN ME' light appears.

Breville espresso machines clean efficiently with specialized cleaning tablets. These tablets break down coffee oils and residue inside the brew group and shower screen. You insert a tablet into the portafilter or designated slot, then activate the machine's cleaning cycle. This process keeps your machine working well and your coffee tasting fresh.

## Why Cleaning Your Breville Espresso Machine Is Important

You love the rich aroma and deep flavor of your homemade espresso. This pleasure comes from a well-maintained Breville espresso machine. Over time, coffee oils and grounds build up inside the machine. This buildup makes your coffee taste bitter or stale. It also affects how your machine works.

When coffee oils harden, they can clog the internal parts. This includes the brew group, shower screen, and portafilter. Clogged parts reduce water flow and brew pressure. Your espresso shot will not extract properly. This means you lose out on the full flavor of your coffee beans. Think of it like cooking with dirty pans; the food just does not taste right.

Regular cleaning extends the life of your machine. It prevents costly repairs down the road. A clean machine runs smoothly and efficiently. This keeps the internal components in good condition. Skipping cleaning can lead to faster wear and tear on parts. So, taking time to clean your Breville machine protects your investment. It also ensures you always get the best possible coffee.

Moreover, good hygiene is key for anything that handles food or drinks. Cleaning removes bacteria and mold that can grow in warm, wet environments. You want your coffee to be pure and clean. Therefore, cleaning your Breville machine is not just about taste; it is about health too. It ensures that every cup of coffee you drink is safe and delicious.

## Understanding Breville Cleaning Tablets

Breville cleaning tablets are special tools for your espresso machine. These small, solid tablets contain powerful cleaning agents. They are made to dissolve coffee oils and residues. These residues stick to the inner parts of your machine after each brew. Regular soap and water cannot clean these parts as well.

The tablets work by reacting with water inside the machine. They create a foaming action that lifts away stubborn coffee gunk. This happens in areas like the brew group and shower screen. The chemicals in the tablets are food-safe. They are designed to be rinsed away completely after the cleaning cycle. This leaves no taste or smell behind.

Breville makes its own brand of cleaning tablets. Many other companies also make compatible tablets. It is best to use tablets specifically for espresso machines. Avoid general household cleaners. These can damage your machine or leave harmful residues. Always check your machine's manual for recommended cleaning products. Using the right tablet ensures effective cleaning and protects your machine's warranty.

Cleaning tablets are different from descaling solutions. Cleaning tablets remove coffee oils and residues. Descaling solutions remove mineral buildup, also known as limescale. Limescale comes from hard water. Many Breville machines have separate indicators for cleaning and descaling. Make sure you use the right product for the right job. We will discuss descaling in more detail later.

## Preparing Your Breville Espresso Machine for Cleaning

Before you begin the cleaning process, a little preparation helps a lot. Taking these steps makes the cleaning cycle more effective. It also prevents any mess or problems. First, turn off your Breville espresso machine and let it cool down. This ensures safety and prevents burns. Unplugging the machine is also a good idea before you start handling parts.

Next, remove the portafilter from the brew group. Empty any spent coffee grounds from the portafilter. Give the portafilter a quick rinse under warm water. This removes loose grounds. Also, remove the drip tray and empty it. Rinse the drip tray with warm, soapy water. Then dry it thoroughly. This prevents dirty water from overflowing during the cleaning cycle.

Check the water tank. Make sure it has enough clean, fresh water. Some cleaning cycles use a lot of water. A full tank ensures the cycle completes without interruption. If your water tank is low, fill it to the maximum line. This step is important for flushing out all cleaning solution residues later.

Finally, make sure the machine is in a good spot for cleaning. Place it near a sink or over a large basin. The cleaning cycle will flush water through the system. This water will contain the dissolved tablet and coffee residues. You want to make sure this dirty water has a place to go. Having a towel nearby is also a good idea. This helps with any small spills. This preparation makes the cleaning process smooth and efficient.

## The Step-by-Step Process: Cleaning with Tablets

Cleaning your Breville espresso machine with tablets is straightforward. Most Breville models have a built-in cleaning cycle. This makes the job easy. Here is a general step-by-step guide:

1.  **Empty and Prepare:**
    *   Turn on your Breville espresso machine.
    *   Empty the drip tray and clean it.
    *   Remove the portafilter and discard any old coffee puck.
    *   Ensure the water tank is full of fresh water.

2.  **Insert the Cleaning Tablet:**
    *   Locate the silicone cleaning disc. This disc usually comes with your machine. It fits inside the portafilter basket. If you do not have one, you might need to buy a universal blind filter basket.
    *   Place the cleaning disc into the single shot filter basket inside your portafilter.
    *   Put one Breville cleaning tablet on top of the cleaning disc.
    *   Lock the portafilter back into the brew group. Make sure it is securely in place.

3.  **Initiate the Cleaning Cycle:**
    *   The way to start the cleaning cycle varies by model. Look for a "CLEAN ME" light or a combination of buttons.
    *   For many Breville models, you might press and hold the "1-CUP" and "2-CUP" buttons together. Hold them for about 5 seconds until the cleaning light flashes.
    *   Some machines, like the Barista Express, have a dedicated "CLEAN" button. Consult your machine's manual for exact instructions. Your manual is the best source for this.
    *   The machine will then start its cleaning cycle. This usually involves a series of pumps and pauses. It pushes water through the portafilter and brew group. The water mixes with the tablet to clean thoroughly.

4.  **Allow Cycle to Complete:**
    *   The cleaning cycle can take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes.
    *   Do not remove the portafilter or interrupt the cycle.
    *   The machine will stop automatically when the cycle is done. The "CLEAN ME" light will usually turn off.

5.  **Rinse the Machine:**
    *   Once the cycle finishes, remove the portafilter.
    *   Rinse the portafilter, cleaning disc, and filter basket well under running water.
    *   Run one or two empty brew cycles without the portafilter. Use just hot water. This flushes out any remaining cleaning solution. It is vital for removing all chemical residues.

    *   You can also run one empty cycle with the portafilter in place. Just make sure the filter basket is empty.

6.  **Clean Exterior and Enjoy:**
    *   Wipe down the exterior of your machine with a damp cloth.
    *   Empty and clean the drip tray again.
    *   Your Breville espresso machine is now clean and ready to make delicious coffee. You can also explore how to clean your [espresso machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-espresso-machine) in general.

Remember to perform this cleaning regularly. Most machines signal when they need cleaning. This is often after 200 shots. Following these steps ensures your machine stays in top condition.

## Cleaning vs. Descaling: Knowing the Difference for Your Breville

It is easy to confuse cleaning with descaling. Both are vital for your Breville espresso machine. However, they address different problems. Understanding the difference helps you maintain your machine properly. Using the right product for the right job is key.

**Cleaning** primarily targets coffee oils and residues. When you brew coffee, oils from the beans stick to the internal parts. This includes the brew group, shower screen, and portafilter. Over time, these oils turn stale and rancid. They give your coffee a bitter, unpleasant taste. Cleaning tablets are made to dissolve these organic compounds. They break down the sticky buildup. Your machine's "CLEAN ME" light usually tells you when to perform this. This cleaning restores the flavor of your coffee. It ensures proper water flow through the coffee puck.

**Descaling** targets mineral buildup, also known as limescale. Water contains minerals like calcium and magnesium. These minerals deposit inside the heating elements and pipes as water heats up. Hard water has more minerals and causes faster buildup. Limescale reduces heating efficiency and clogs water pathways. This slows down brewing and can damage your machine's internal components. Descaling solutions are acidic. They dissolve these mineral deposits. Your machine's "DESCALE" light usually tells you when to perform this. If you want to know more about cleaning your Breville machine in general, you can find a guide here: [how to clean Breville espresso machine without tablets](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-breville-espresso-machine-without-tablets). This guide specifically mentions methods that might include descaling, often done without tablets, but with liquid solutions.

You should perform both cleaning and descaling as needed. Cleaning tablets handle the coffee oil buildup. Descaling solutions tackle mineral scale. Your Breville machine will likely have separate indicator lights for each task. Do not use cleaning tablets for descaling, and do not use descaling solution for routine cleaning. Each product has a specific chemical makeup for its purpose. Using them correctly keeps your machine healthy and your coffee delicious. Ignoring either task will lead to poor performance and potential damage.

## Post-Cleaning Care and Maintenance Tips

Cleaning your Breville espresso machine with tablets is a big step. But keeping it in top shape involves more than just periodic deep cleans. Daily habits and simple maintenance steps go a long way. These actions prevent future buildup and ensure great coffee every time. Think of it as routine check-ups for your machine.

First, always purge the steam wand after each use. Milk residues can dry inside the wand very quickly. This creates blockages and bacteria growth. Wipe the wand immediately with a damp cloth. Then briefly open the steam valve. This pushes out any milk left inside. This simple step prevents major clogs and keeps your milk frothing perfectly.

Empty and rinse the drip tray daily. This tray collects excess water and coffee drips. It can become a breeding ground for mold if left uncleaned. A quick rinse under the tap is usually enough. For a deeper clean, use warm, soapy water weekly. This keeps your machine area tidy and hygienic.

Wipe down the exterior of your machine regularly. Coffee spills and water marks can accumulate. A soft, damp cloth is all you need. Pay attention to the brew group and portafilter locking area. Coffee grounds can gather there. Keeping the outside clean also shows you care for your machine. This care makes it more enjoyable to use.

Use filtered water if your tap water is hard. Hard water leads to more mineral buildup. This means you will need to descale your machine more often. A water filter pitcher or a machine with a built-in water filter helps reduce this problem. This extends the time between descaling cycles. It also helps your machine work better.

Finally, establish a regular cleaning schedule. Your Breville machine will tell you when it needs a deep clean. This is usually after about 200 shots. But if you use your machine heavily, consider cleaning it more often. Consistency in maintenance extends your machine's life. It ensures every cup tastes as good as the first. These small, consistent efforts make a huge difference in your coffee experience.

## Troubleshooting Common Cleaning Issues

Even with a perfect plan, you might face small issues when cleaning your Breville machine. Do not worry. Most problems have simple fixes. Knowing what to do can save you time and frustration. Let's look at some common cleaning issues.

**"CLEAN ME" Light Stays On After Cleaning:** This is a common concern. Usually, it means the cleaning cycle did not complete its full run. Or perhaps the machine did not register the cycle completion.
*   **Solution:** Rerun the cleaning cycle. Make sure you follow the steps exactly from your machine's manual. Hold the buttons for the correct duration. Ensure there is enough water in the tank. Sometimes, a power cycle helps. Turn off the machine, unplug it for 30 seconds, then plug it back in and try again.

**Cleaning Tablet Not Dissolving:** If the tablet is still visible or feels solid after the cycle, it did not dissolve properly.
*   **Solution:** Make sure you use the correct tablet size for your machine. Ensure the cleaning disc or blind filter is placed correctly. The water flow might be too low. You can try a slightly warmer water flush before starting the cycle. If the tablet is very old, it might have lost its potency. Try a fresh tablet.

**Water Not Flowing During Cleaning Cycle:** This indicates a blockage or a pump issue.
*   **Solution:** First, check if the water tank is full and seated correctly. Ensure the cleaning disc or blind filter is not completely sealed. There might be an airlock. You can try running a few plain water cycles without the tablet first. If the problem persists, the machine might need descaling. Mineral buildup can cause blockages. If still no flow, contact Breville support.

**Machine Leaking During Cleaning:** Small drips are normal, but significant leaks are not.
*   **Solution:** Check that the portafilter is locked in securely. The silicone gasket around the brew group might be old or dirty. Clean the gasket thoroughly. If it is cracked or hard, it needs replacement. You can usually buy replacement gaskets online or from Breville.

**Coffee Tastes Strange After Cleaning:** This means some cleaning solution might be left inside.
*   **Solution:** Run several plain water cycles through the brew group. Do this without a portafilter. Then run a few more cycles with an empty portafilter in place. Continue until the water runs clear and tastes normal. It is crucial to flush out all residues.

Facing these issues is part of machine ownership. With these tips, you can quickly get your Breville back to making great coffee. Do not hesitate to check your machine's specific manual for more detailed troubleshooting.
