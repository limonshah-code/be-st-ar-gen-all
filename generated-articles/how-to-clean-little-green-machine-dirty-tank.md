*   Sanitize with vinegar or a dilute bleach solution to kill odors and mold.

Cleaning your Little Green Machine's dirty tank involves emptying it, disassembling the parts, scrubbing away grime with warm, soapy water, sanitizing with a vinegar or bleach solution, and then allowing all components to dry completely before reassembly. This prevents odors and maintains machine performance.

### Why Your Little Green Tank Gets Dirty and Why Clean It

Your Little Green Machine handles tough cleaning jobs. It pulls dirt, grime, and liquid from surfaces. All this debris then goes into the dirty water tank. Over time, this tank becomes a collection point for all sorts of things.

The dirty water tank holds a mixture of water, cleaning solution, and the contaminants from your carpets. These contaminants include pet dander, food particles, dust, and general soil. This creates a prime environment for bacteria, mold, and mildew. These microscopic organisms thrive in damp, enclosed spaces. They feed on organic residues. This leads to foul odors. It can also cause a slimy build-up inside the tank.

Cleaning the dirty tank is more than just about smell. A dirty tank can block airflow and reduce suction power. This means your machine does not clean as effectively. The accumulated grime can also affect the motor and other internal components. Regular cleaning extends the life of your appliance. It also ensures you are truly cleaning your home, not just spreading old dirt. A clean tank helps the machine work at its best. It keeps your cleaning efforts truly hygienic.

### Gathering Your Cleaning Tools and Supplies

Before you start cleaning, gather all necessary items. Having everything ready makes the process smooth and quick. You probably have most of these items already in your home. This preparation prevents interruptions during cleaning.

You will need warm water. Warm water helps break down grease and grime more effectively. You also need a mild dish soap. This soap cuts through dirt without damaging plastic components. A soft-bristled brush or an old toothbrush is essential. These brushes reach into small corners and crevices. They scrub away stubborn residue.

Additionally, keep a few clean cloths or paper towels handy. These are for wiping and drying surfaces. For sanitizing, you might use white vinegar or a diluted bleach solution. Ensure you have gloves for protection, especially when using bleach. A bucket or sink basin is also useful for rinsing components. Having these supplies ready saves time. It helps you clean your Little Green Machine's dirty tank thoroughly.

### Initial Steps: Emptying and Rinsing Both Tanks

Starting your cleaning process properly is key. The very first step involves handling both the dirty water tank and the clean water solution tank. Do this immediately after you finish cleaning a surface. This prevents grime from drying and hardening inside.

First, unplug your Little Green Machine for safety. Then, remove the dirty water tank. Most Little Green models have a clear dirty water tank located at the front or side. Carefully unlatch it and lift it off the machine. Take it to a utility sink or toilet. Pour out all the collected dirty water and debris. Rinse the inside of this tank thoroughly with warm water. Shake it vigorously to dislodge loose particles.

Next, address the clean water solution tank. Even if it is not completely empty, it is wise to rinse it. Any leftover cleaning solution can dry out or leave residue. Empty any remaining solution from this tank. Rinse it with warm, clean water. This simple step helps remove chemical build-up. It also prepares the tank for fresh solution next time. Proper rinsing after each use makes deeper cleaning much easier. This ensures your machine is always ready for its next job.

### Deep Cleaning the Dirty Water Tank: Tackling Grime and Odors

The dirty water tank requires the most attention. It collects all the gunk. This part gets slimy and stinky if not cleaned well. A deep clean removes set-in grime and nasty odors. You need to disassemble it for a proper clean.

Most Little Green dirty tanks have removable parts. This includes the lid, the filter, and sometimes an internal float mechanism. Carefully detach these components according to your machine's manual. Pay close attention to the filter. It often traps hair and larger debris. Clean it well.

Now, for the main tank body. Fill it with warm water and a few drops of mild dish soap. Use your soft-bristled brush or old toothbrush. Scrub all interior surfaces. Focus on corners, edges, and any textured areas. These spots collect the most grime. For very stubborn build-up, let the soapy water sit in the tank for 10-15 minutes. This helps loosen the crud. Scrub again after soaking. Rinse everything thoroughly under running warm water until no soap residue remains. Make sure all disassembled parts also get this scrubbing and rinsing. This detailed cleaning prevents future odors. It also helps your Little Green Machine maintain strong suction.

### Cleaning the Solution Tank and Nozzles: Ensuring Freshness

While the dirty tank gets most of the mess, the solution tank and nozzles also need care. The solution tank holds fresh water and cleaning formula. It can develop residue from dried solutions or mineral deposits from hard water. This affects flow. The nozzle delivers the cleaning solution. It can clog with debris or dried formula.

Start with the solution tank. Empty any remaining cleaning solution. Rinse it several times with clean, warm water. If you notice a film inside, add a small amount of warm water and a capful of white vinegar. Swish this mixture around. Let it sit for about 15 minutes. Vinegar helps dissolve mineral deposits and mild soap residue. After soaking, rinse the tank thoroughly until the water runs clear. Make sure no vinegar smell remains.

Next, focus on the spray nozzle. This part often gets overlooked. It is crucial for even solution distribution. If the nozzle is removable, take it off. Rinse it under strong running water. If it is clogged, use a thin needle or a toothpick to clear the opening gently. Never use anything too sharp or hard that could scratch or damage the nozzle. You can also spray clean water through the nozzle while attached to the machine to test its function. This simple cleaning step prevents uneven spray patterns. It ensures your cleaning solution reaches the targeted area properly. This ensures your cleaning process is efficient.

### Disinfecting and Deodorizing Your Little Green Tanks

After cleaning, disinfecting and deodorizing are crucial steps. This removes any lingering bacteria and odors. It ensures your machine is truly hygienic for its next use. It also helps prevent future mold growth inside the tanks.

You have a few options for disinfection. White vinegar is a natural disinfectant and deodorizer. Mix equal parts white vinegar and warm water. Pour this mixture into both the dirty water tank and the solution tank. Swirl it around, ensuring all surfaces are coated. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes. For a deeper clean, you can let it sit for a few hours. After soaking, empty the tanks. Rinse them thoroughly with clean water until the vinegar smell is gone.

Another option is a very diluted bleach solution. Mix one teaspoon of bleach with one gallon of water. Use this solution to rinse the dirty water tank only. Bleach is a stronger disinfectant. However, it requires careful handling. Never mix bleach with any other cleaning products, especially those containing ammonia. Always wear gloves. After using bleach, rinse the tank many times with plain water. You must remove all bleach residue. Bleach can damage your machine or surfaces if not rinsed completely. Air dry the tanks completely after disinfection. This step ensures your tanks are fresh and ready. Keeping water tanks clean applies to many machines; see [how to clean water tank](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-water-tank) for general advice.

### Drying and Reassembling Your Little Green Machine

Proper drying is a critical, often overlooked, step. Trapped moisture leads to mold and mildew. This undoes all your cleaning efforts. It also creates unpleasant smells and can even damage your machine over time. Ensure all parts are completely dry before you put them back together.

After rinsing and disinfecting, lay out all the tank components. Place them on a clean, dry towel. You can also place them in a well-ventilated area. Natural air drying is best. This allows air to circulate around all surfaces. If you live in a humid environment, consider pointing a small fan towards the parts. This speeds up the drying process. Do not use heat, like a hairdryer, unless the manufacturer specifically recommends it. Excessive heat can warp or damage plastic parts.

Visually inspect each part before reassembly. Look for any remaining moisture. Feel surfaces to confirm they are dry to the touch. Once everything is completely dry, carefully reassemble your Little Green Machine's tanks. Ensure all seals are properly seated. Make sure latches click into place. Correct reassembly prevents leaks and ensures optimal performance. Your Little Green Machine is now clean, fresh, and ready for its next use. Proper drying is just as important for other machines, like learning [how to clean a Hoover PowerDash Pet dirty water tank](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hoover-powerdash-pet-dirty-water-tank).

### Routine Maintenance for a Spotless Little Green Tank

Regular maintenance keeps your Little Green Machine performing its best. It also prevents the build-up of grime and odors. Think of routine care as essential for extending your machine's life. Small steps after each use make a big difference.

Always empty both the dirty and clean water tanks immediately after finishing a cleaning job. Do not let dirty water sit in the tank overnight or for extended periods. This is the primary cause of foul odors and mildew growth. After emptying, rinse both tanks thoroughly with warm, clean water. A quick rinse removes most loose debris and cleaning solution residue. For the dirty water tank, a quick scrub with a brush can help if you see any immediate slime.

Beyond immediate post-use care, plan for a deeper clean every few uses, or monthly if you use the machine frequently. This involves the disassembly, scrubbing, and sanitizing steps mentioned earlier. Check the nozzle and hose for any clogs. Ensure all external parts of the machine are wiped down. This includes the outside of the tanks and the body of the cleaner. Regular attention keeps your Little Green Machine efficient and fresh. This routine prevents major cleaning issues. It ensures your valuable tool is always ready to tackle new messes.
