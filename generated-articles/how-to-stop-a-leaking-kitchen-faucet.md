### How do I stop my kitchen faucet from leaking?

To stop a kitchen faucet from leaking, you first turn off the water supply. Then, you find the source of the leak. Common causes include worn washers, O-rings, or a faulty cartridge. Replacing these parts often resolves the issue. Follow the steps specific to your faucet type for a successful repair.

## Understanding Leaking Kitchen Faucets: Causes and Types

A dripping kitchen faucet is more than an annoyance; it signals a problem with your plumbing. Understanding why faucets leak is the first step to fixing them. Different faucet types have different parts that can fail. Knowing your faucet type helps you choose the right repair method.

Most kitchen faucet leaks come from worn-out internal components. Over time, water pressure, mineral deposits, and daily use take a toll on these parts. Washers can harden and crack. O-rings can lose their flexibility. Cartridges can wear down, failing to create a tight seal. Sometimes, a loose packing nut or a damaged valve seat causes the drip. Ignoring a small drip can lead to bigger problems later, like water damage under your sink.

There are four main types of kitchen faucets, and each leaks for specific reasons:

### Compression Faucets
These are older and have separate hot and cold handles. They work by compressing a rubber washer against a valve seat to stop water flow. Leaks usually happen when the washer wears out or the valve seat gets corroded. This is often the simplest **leaking kitchen faucet** to repair.

### Cartridge Faucets
These faucets use a cylindrical cartridge that moves up and down to control water flow and temperature. They can have one or two handles. A leak often means the cartridge itself is faulty or its O-rings are worn. Many modern single-handle faucets are cartridge types. If you have a [Moen Motionsense kitchen faucet, troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/moen-motionsense-kitchen-faucet-troubleshooting) steps might involve cartridge inspection.

### Disc Faucets
These are single-handle faucets with a wide, cylindrical body. They use ceramic discs to control water flow. Leaks occur if the ceramic discs crack or if the rubber seals around the discs wear out. Mineral build-up can also make the discs less effective.

### Ball Faucets
These are typically single-handle faucets with a ball-shaped mechanism inside. They are common in older homes. Leaks usually come from worn O-rings around the ball assembly or from the inlet seals and springs. Repairing a ball faucet can be a bit trickier due to many small parts.

Understanding your faucet type makes diagnosing the leak much easier. This knowledge prepares you for the specific repair steps ahead.

*   **Valve Seats and Springs:** These are common culprits for ball and disc faucet leaks. They often come as a repair kit.
*   **Plumber's Grease:** This silicone-based grease helps O-rings and other moving parts seal better and move smoothly. Do not use petroleum jelly, as it can damage rubber.
*   **Plumber's Tape (PTFE Tape):** This tape helps create a tight seal on threaded pipe connections. It is good to have on hand for any pipe work.

Always shut off the water supply to your kitchen sink before you start any work. Find the shut-off valves under the sink. Turn both hot and cold handles until they are fully off. Then, open the faucet to drain any remaining water from the lines. This simple step prevents a flood.

## Diagnosing Your Leaky Kitchen Faucet

Finding the exact source of a leak is crucial for a successful repair. A **leaking kitchen faucet** can drip from various places. Observing the leak carefully helps narrow down the problem. Do not rush this step.

Here is how to diagnose your leaky faucet:

### Where Does the Leak Come From?

*   **Drip from the Spout:** This is the most common leak. It usually means an issue with the internal seals that control water flow. For compression faucets, it points to a worn washer or valve seat. For cartridge, disc, or ball faucets, it suggests a problem with the cartridge, ceramic discs, or ball assembly and O-rings.
*   **Leak from the Faucet Base:** If water pools around the bottom of the faucet where it meets the sink, it is often a loose mounting nut. It could also mean worn O-rings on the faucet body itself, especially in single-handle designs. Sometimes, water splashes and runs down, making it seem like a base leak. Confirm it is truly coming from the base.
*   **Leak from the Handles:** If water leaks from the hot or cold handle, it typically means a problem with the packing nut or O-rings inside the handle assembly. This is common in compression and some cartridge faucets.
*   **Leak Under the Sink:** Water dripping from the connections or supply lines below the sink suggests loose fittings or damaged supply hoses. Check these connections for tightness. Sometimes, a leak from the faucet above can travel down and appear under the sink. Make sure to trace the actual source. You might also want to inspect the connections to your spray head if you have one. If you have a sprayer, you can find help for your [kitchen faucet spray head](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-kitchen-faucet-spray-head) with our guide.

### Steps for Diagnosis:

1.  **Observe the Drip:** Watch the faucet for a few minutes. Is it a steady drip or intermittent? Does it leak only when water is running or constantly?
2.  **Feel Around the Faucet:** Carefully feel for moisture around the base, handles, and spout. Use a dry paper towel to help locate very small leaks.
3.  **Check Under the Sink:** Use a flashlight and look for water stains, drips, or puddles. Feel around the supply lines, connections, and the underside of the faucet body.
4.  **Identify Faucet Type:** As discussed, knowing your faucet type helps predict what parts might be faulty. This guides your repair plan.
5.  **Look for Visible Damage:** Sometimes, parts like cracked handles or corroded nuts are visible indicators of a problem.

Once you have identified where the water is coming from, you can focus on the specific components in that area. This targeted approach makes fixing your **leaking kitchen faucet** much more efficient. If your faucet is behaving oddly in other ways, refer to our broader [kitchen faucet troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/kitchen-faucet-troubleshooting) guide for more insights.

## General Faucet Leak Troubleshooting and Maintenance Tips

Even after fixing specific components, a **leaking kitchen faucet** can sometimes be stubborn. General troubleshooting steps and regular maintenance can prevent future leaks. These tips apply to all faucet types and help keep your kitchen faucet in good working order.

### Check All Connections

Sometimes, the leak is not from an internal part of the faucet, but from a loose connection.

*   **Supply Lines:** Check the hot and cold water supply lines underneath the sink. Use an adjustable wrench to gently tighten the nuts connecting them to the faucet and to the shut-off valves. Do not overtighten, as this can strip threads or damage pipes.
*   **Mounting Nuts:** The faucet is held to the sink by large mounting nuts underneath. If these are loose, the faucet can wobble and leak from the base. Use a basin wrench to tighten these nuts securely.
*   **Spray Head Hose:** If your faucet has a pull-out or side spray head, check its connection under the sink. The hose might be loose or damaged. You can also explore how to [clean a kitchen faucet head](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-kitchen-faucet-head) if you suspect clogs there.

### Address Mineral Buildup

Hard water can leave mineral deposits inside your faucet. This buildup can corrode parts, block flow, and prevent seals from working correctly.

*   **Cleaning Aerator:** A clogged aerator can cause strange water flow, but it rarely causes a constant leak from the spout when the faucet is off. However, if water splashes weirdly, the aerator might need cleaning. Unscrew it, clean the mesh screens, and soak in vinegar to remove mineral deposits.
*   **Internal Cleaning:** For internal mineral buildup, especially around valve seats or cartridges, disassembly and gentle scrubbing can help. A vinegar soak for metal parts (not rubber) can dissolve stubborn deposits. Regularly cleaning your [sink faucet](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-sink-faucet) can prevent future buildup issues.

### Regular Maintenance for Longevity

Prevention is better than cure when it comes to a **leaking kitchen faucet**.

*   **Gentle Use:** Avoid overtightening faucet handles. This puts unnecessary stress on washers and O-rings, making them wear out faster.
*   **Annual Inspection:** Once a year, take a look at your faucet. Check for any signs of wear, especially if you have hard water. A quick inspection can catch small issues before they become big leaks.
*   **Lubricate Moving Parts:** Apply plumber's grease to O-rings and other moving internal parts when you disassemble the faucet for cleaning or repair. This keeps them flexible and helps maintain a good seal.
*   **Monitor Water Pressure:** Very high water pressure can strain faucet components. If you notice extremely strong flow or loud noises when turning on the faucet, you might have high water pressure. A pressure regulator can help protect your plumbing system.

Following these general tips can help you not only **stop a leaking kitchen faucet** but also extend its life and prevent future problems.

## When to Call a Professional Plumber

While many **leaking kitchen faucet** issues are DIY-friendly, some situations are best left to a professional. Knowing when to call a plumber can save you time, money, and potential damage to your home. I understand the desire to fix things yourself, but some jobs require expert skills.

Here are scenarios where calling a plumber is a wise decision:

*   **Persistent Leaks After DIY Attempts:** You have tried all the steps, replaced the relevant parts, but the **leaking kitchen faucet** still drips. This
