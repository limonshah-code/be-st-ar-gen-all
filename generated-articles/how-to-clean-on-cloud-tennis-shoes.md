To effectively clean On Cloud tennis shoes, you must use gentle products and methods. First, remove loose dirt with a soft brush. Then, hand wash the uppers and soles using mild soap and warm water. Finally, air dry them completely. This process protects the unique materials and design of On Cloud footwear.

### Why Clean Your On Cloud Tennis Shoes?

Your On Cloud tennis shoes are more than just footwear. They are a blend of advanced design and comfort. The unique CloudTec soles provide a soft landing and powerful takeoff. The lightweight mesh uppers offer breathability. Regular cleaning protects these special features. It keeps your shoes performing at their best.

Dirt and sweat can break down materials over time. Fabric fibers can weaken. Glued parts can lose their bond. Cleaning removes these harmful elements. It stops wear and tear. A clean shoe also looks better. It shows you care about your gear. Many people wonder about the best way to care for their athletic footwear. Proper cleaning extends the life of your shoes. This means you enjoy their comfort and style for a longer time. Keeping your On Clouds clean also helps maintain their light feel and responsiveness.

When dirt gets into the mesh, it can make the shoe heavier. It can also block airflow. This reduces the breathability On Cloud shoes are known for. Cleaning clears these blockages. It keeps the shoe feeling fresh on your foot. A well-maintained shoe performs better during runs or walks. It provides the support you expect. Think of cleaning as part of your shoe's routine maintenance. It is a simple step that makes a big difference. This routine keeps your shoes ready for any activity.

### Essential Tools for Cleaning On Cloud Tennis Shoes

Having the right tools makes cleaning your On Cloud tennis shoes much easier. You do not need many items. Simple household products often work best. Gathering everything before you start saves time. It also ensures you clean effectively.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Soft-bristled brush or old toothbrush:** This helps remove loose dirt. It gently cleans mesh and fabric.
*   **Microfiber cloths:** These are soft and absorbent. They wipe down surfaces without scratching.
*   **Mild soap:** Dish soap or laundry detergent works well. Look for clear, gentle formulas. Avoid harsh chemicals. Harsh chemicals can damage materials.
*   **Small bowl:** For mixing soap and water.
*   **Warm water:** Not hot water, as heat can affect glues and fabrics.
*   **Shoe cleaner solution (optional):** Some commercial cleaners are made for sneakers. Ensure they are safe for mesh and synthetic materials.
*   **Gloves (optional):** To protect your hands from dirt and cleaning solutions.

You might also consider a shoe deodorizer. This helps remove smells after cleaning. A shoe tree or crumpled paper can help shoes keep their shape while drying. Avoid using paper towels inside the shoe for drying, as they can stick. Use clean cloths instead. These tools ensure a thorough and safe cleaning process. Preparing your supplies helps you focus on the cleaning steps. This makes the job smooth and efficient.

### Preparing Your On Cloud Shoes for Washing

Before you start scrubbing, prepare your On Cloud tennis shoes. This initial step is important. It removes loose dirt and protects delicate parts. Proper preparation makes the cleaning process more effective. It also prevents dirt from spreading.

Follow these steps:

1.  **Remove laces and insoles:** Take out the shoelaces. Pull out the insoles from inside the shoes. Laces and insoles gather a lot of dirt and sweat. Cleaning them separately ensures a thorough job. You can hand wash laces in soapy water. Allow them to air dry fully. For insoles, gently scrub them with a soft brush and mild soap. Rinse them well and let them air dry. This prevents odor buildup inside the shoe. Learn more about [how to clean the inside of shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes).
2.  **Remove loose dirt:** Use a soft-bristled brush or an old toothbrush. Brush off any dry dirt or mud from the uppers and soles. Pay attention to the grooves of the CloudTec sole. Dirt often gets stuck there. This step stops dirt from becoming mud when wet. It also prevents scratching the shoe's surface during scrubbing. You can also tap the shoes together over a trash can. This knocks off any large clumps of dirt.
3.  **Rinse with water:** If your shoes are very muddy, give them a quick rinse. Use cool water to spray off excess mud. Do not soak the shoes fully yet. This simply helps loosen stubborn dirt before deeper cleaning.

Taking these steps ensures your shoes are ready for a deep clean. It makes the main cleaning process easier. This preparation helps achieve a truly clean result.

### Hand Washing the Uppers of On Cloud Shoes

Hand washing is the best method for cleaning the fabric uppers of your On Cloud tennis shoes. Machine washing can damage the delicate mesh and glues. Hand washing allows you to control the pressure. It protects the shoe's structure. Many On Cloud shoes feature mesh materials, which need gentle care. If you have white mesh, it's particularly important to be gentle. For more tips on white mesh, you can check out [how to clean white mesh tennis shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-mesh-tennis-shoes).

Here is how to clean the uppers:

1.  **Prepare cleaning solution:** Mix a small amount of mild soap with warm water in your bowl. You want a foamy, but not overly soapy, solution. Too much soap leaves residue.
2.  **Clean the mesh and fabric uppers:** Dip a microfiber cloth or soft brush into the solution. Gently scrub the mesh, fabric, and synthetic parts of the shoe's upper. Use small, circular motions. Work on one section at a time. Be gentle on the mesh. Do not push too hard. The goal is to lift dirt, not push it deeper. For tough spots, apply a bit more solution. Let it sit for a minute. Then, continue scrubbing gently. I find this method works very well. It cleans without harming the shoe.
3.  **Wipe clean:** After scrubbing a section, use a clean, damp microfiber cloth to wipe away the soap and dirt. Rinse your cloth often. You want to remove all soap residue. Soap left on the shoe can attract more dirt later. Continue this process until the entire upper is clean. Pay attention to all surfaces. This includes the tongue and inside collar. For general shoe cleaning tips, you can refer to [how to clean shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes).

This careful hand washing removes surface dirt. It also protects the integrity of your On Cloud shoes. It helps maintain their lightweight feel and appearance.

### Cleaning the Unique CloudTec Outsoles

The CloudTec sole is a signature feature of On Cloud tennis shoes. It has many "clouds" or hollow pods. These provide cushioning and support. Dirt and small stones often get stuck in these spaces. Cleaning these parts needs a bit more attention. This process ensures the sole performs as intended. It also maintains the shoe's overall clean look.

Here is how to clean the outsoles:

1.  **Remove stuck debris:** Use an old toothbrush, a toothpick, or a small pick tool. Carefully remove any small stones, mud, or debris stuck in the CloudTec pods. Be gentle to avoid damaging the rubber. Work patiently. This step is important for both cleanliness and function. Dirt in the pods can affect cushioning.
2.  **Scrub the outsole and midsole:** Dip your soft-bristled brush or a clean cloth into your mild soap solution. Scrub the entire outsole. This includes the bottom of the shoe and the side walls of the midsole. The midsole is the part between the upper and the outsole. Apply a bit more pressure here than on the uppers. These areas are durable. They can handle more scrubbing. Pay special attention to any scuff marks on the white midsole.
3.  **Wipe and rinse:** Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe away all soap and dirt. For the outsole, you can rinse it directly under running water. Make sure no soap residue remains in the CloudTec pods. Use the brush to clear out any remaining suds. This step finishes the cleaning of the sole. It restores its clean appearance. For shoes with white outsoles or midsoles, you might find specific tips on [how to clean white shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes) helpful.

Cleaning the CloudTec sole not only makes your On Clouds look better. It also ensures the cushioning system works properly. This step is vital for the shoe's performance.

### Removing Tough Stains from On Cloud Materials

Sometimes, regular cleaning is not enough for stubborn stains. On Cloud shoes, especially lighter colors, can show marks easily. Common stains include grass, oil, or scuff marks. Different materials respond to different treatments. Knowing how to target these spots helps restore your shoes.

Here are methods for tough stains:

*   **For General Stains (Grass, Light Dirt):**
    1.  Make a paste with baking soda and a small amount of water.
    2.  Apply the paste directly onto the stain.
    3.  Let it sit for 15-20 minutes.
    4.  Gently scrub with a soft brush.
    5.  Wipe clean with a damp cloth.
    Baking soda is a natural, gentle abrasive. It helps lift dirt.
*   **For Oil or Grease Stains:**
    1.  Sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder directly on the stain immediately. This absorbs the oil.
    2.  Let it sit for several hours, or overnight.
    3.  Brush off the powder.
    4.  Follow with a gentle soap and water scrub.
    5.  Rinse the area with a damp cloth.
    Acting quickly is key for oil stains.
*   **For Scuff Marks on Soles:**
    1.  Use a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser (or similar melamine foam sponge).
    2.  Dampen the eraser.
    3.  Gently rub the scuff mark on the rubber outsole or midsole.
    4.  The eraser works like a fine abrasive. It lifts marks without harsh chemicals.
    5.  Wipe the area with a clean, damp cloth afterward.
    This works very well for white rubber parts.

Always test any stain removal method on a small, hidden area first. This prevents damage to your shoe's material. Be patient with tough stains. Sometimes, a repeat treatment is necessary. Remember that some stains might be permanent. However, these methods greatly improve the shoe's appearance. For more detailed advice on removing various marks, consult guides on [how to clean stained shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stained-shoes).

### Drying and Finishing Your On Cloud Shoes

Proper drying is as important as cleaning. Incorrect drying can cause damage. It can shrink materials or weaken glues. It can also lead to bad smells. On Cloud shoes need to dry naturally. This protects their unique design and materials.

Follow these drying steps carefully:

1.  **Do not use direct heat:** Never put your On Cloud shoes in a dryer. Do not place them near a radiator or in direct sunlight. High heat can melt glues. It can also warp the shoe's shape. This damage is often permanent.
2.  **Stuff with paper or cloth:** Gently stuff the inside of each shoe with clean paper towels or a clean, dry cloth. White paper towels are best. Newsprint can transfer ink. The paper or cloth absorbs moisture from inside. It also helps the shoe keep its shape as it dries. Change the paper every few hours if the shoes are very wet.
3.  **Air dry in a well-ventilated area:** Place your shoes in a spot with good airflow. A room with an open window works well. Keep them away from direct heat or humidity.
4.  **Allow ample time:** On Cloud shoes can take 24-48 hours to dry completely. This depends on how wet they got and the humidity levels. Do not wear them until they are fully dry. Wearing damp shoes can cause odor and bacteria growth.
5.  **Reinsert insoles and laces:** Once the shoes are completely dry, reinsert the clean insoles and re-lace your shoes. Your On Clouds are now ready to wear.

Proper drying ensures your shoes remain comfortable and durable. It prevents unpleasant odors. It makes sure your cleaning efforts last. Remember, patience in drying pays off.

### Keeping Your On Cloud Shoes Fresh: Odor Control and Storage

Cleaning your On Cloud tennis shoes removes dirt and stains. But what about odors? Sweat and bacteria can cause shoes to smell. Regular odor control keeps your shoes fresh. Proper storage also helps maintain their condition. It prevents them from getting dirty again too quickly.

Here are tips for odor control and storage:

*   **Odor Control:**
    1.  **Use baking soda:** Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda inside each shoe. Let it sit overnight, or for several hours. Baking soda absorbs odors.
    2.  **Remove and clean insoles often:** Insoles trap a lot of sweat and odor. Remove them after each use, if possible. Let them air out. Clean them regularly with soap and water. You can find specific information on [how to clean smelly shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes).
    3.  **Air out shoes:** After wearing, let your shoes air out. Do not put them straight into a dark closet. Air circulation helps dry out sweat. This prevents bacteria growth.
    4.  **Consider shoe deodorizers:** Shoe sprays or cedar shoe trees absorb moisture and leave a fresh scent. These are good additions to your routine.
*   **Proper Storage:**
    1.  **Keep them dry:** Always store your On Cloud shoes when they are completely dry. Storing damp shoes encourages mold and mildew.
    2.  **Store in a cool, dry place:** Avoid hot, humid, or direct sunlight areas. These conditions can degrade materials.
    3.  **Use shoe trees or stuff with paper:** This helps maintain the shoe's shape when not in use. It also keeps the uppers from creasing.
    4.  **Do not store in plastic bags:** Plastic traps moisture. This can lead to odors and material breakdown.
    5.  **Rotate your shoes:** If you have multiple pairs, rotate them. This gives each pair time to fully air out between wears.

Implementing these habits keeps your On Clouds smelling fresh. It also helps them last longer. Clean shoes are happy shoes.

### When to Consider Professional Cleaning or Replacement

While home cleaning methods are effective for most dirt and stains, some situations may call for professional help. Knowing when to seek a pro or even replace your shoes saves time and effort. It also ensures your feet stay healthy and supported.

Consider professional cleaning if:

*   **Stubborn Stains Remain:** After trying all home methods, some stains simply do not come out. Professionals have stronger tools and chemicals. They know how to handle delicate materials. This might include deep-set oil or dye transfer stains.
*   **Deep-Seated Odors:** If the smell persists even after thorough cleaning and deodorizing, a professional can offer specialized treatments. They often use ozone or powerful sanitizers. These treatments reach deeper into the shoe's fabric.
*   **Delicate Materials or Colors:** If your On Clouds have unique materials or very light colors that you fear damaging, a professional service is a safer bet. They have experience with different fabrics and can clean white On Cloud shoes effectively without yellowing. You can also review [how to clean on cloud shoes white](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-on-cloud-shoes-white) for home methods.
*   **Sentimental Value:** For shoes with high sentimental value, trust a professional. They will handle your shoes with extra care.

Consider replacing your On Cloud tennis shoes if:

*   **Sole Wear:** The CloudTec pods wear down. The outsole tread disappears. This means the shoe loses its cushioning and grip. Worn-out soles increase injury risk.
*   **Upper Damage:** Holes appear in the mesh. Seams come undone. These damages affect shoe support and comfort. They also allow dirt in easily.
*   **Loss of Support:** Your feet hurt after wearing them. The shoe feels less stable. This means the midsole cushioning is dead. Athletic shoes have a limited lifespan for cushioning.
*   **Age and Mileage:** Most running shoes last 300-500 miles or 6-12 months. Even if they look okay, the cushioning can be worn out. Keep track of your miles.

Replacing shoes when needed ensures your comfort and performance. It also protects your feet. Regular cleaning extends their life. However, all shoes eventually reach their end.

### Preventing Dirt Buildup in On Cloud Tennis Shoes

Prevention is easier than cleaning. You can take steps to keep your On Cloud tennis shoes cleaner for longer. These habits reduce how often you need to deep clean. They also help your shoes look good between washes.

Here are simple prevention tips:

*   **Brush off dirt after each wear:** Take a few seconds to brush off loose dirt. Use a soft brush. Do this as soon as you take your shoes off. This stops dirt from drying and sticking.
*   **Wipe down regularly:** Use a damp cloth to wipe the uppers and midsoles. Do this weekly. This removes fresh marks before they set. It keeps surfaces looking bright.
*   **Avoid muddy conditions:** Try not to wear your On Clouds in very muddy or wet areas. They are running shoes, but extreme conditions can stain them quickly. Choose different footwear for rough terrain.
*   **Use protective sprays:** Apply a water and stain repellent spray. These sprays create a barrier. It makes dirt and liquids bead up. Reapply every few months. Always check the spray is safe for your shoe's material.
*   **Rotate shoes:** Do not wear the same pair of On Clouds every day. Give them a day to air out and dry completely. This prevents sweat buildup. It also extends the life of the shoe's cushioning.
*   **Clean laces and insoles frequently:** These parts get dirty fast. Cleaning them often prevents dirt from transferring to the shoe body.

By following these prevention tips, you extend the time between deep cleans. Your On Cloud shoes will stay cleaner, fresher, and ready for your next activity.
