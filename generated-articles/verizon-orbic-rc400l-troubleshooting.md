You should only perform a factory reset as a last resort when all other troubleshooting fails. It effectively cleans out corrupted software or stubborn settings issues.

### Soft Reset vs. Factory Reset

A soft reset simply turns the device off and then back on. This refreshes its internal processes. It does not erase any data or settings. It is safe to perform anytime your device acts strangely. Think of it like restarting your computer. It can fix minor freezes, unresponsive buttons, or small connectivity hiccups.

A factory reset, in contrast, wipes all user data and settings from the device. It restores the device to its "out-of-the-box" state. This includes Wi-Fi names, passwords, and any network configurations you made. It is useful for resolving deep software conflicts or persistent errors that a soft reset cannot fix. Always back up any important data or settings before performing a factory reset. For other Verizon devices, such as the [Verizon Network Extender Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/verizon-network-extender-troubleshooting) guide, similar reset principles often apply.

### When to Factory Reset

You should consider a factory reset for your Orbic RC400L when:
*   **Persistent Connectivity Issues:** The device constantly drops connection or refuses to connect, even after soft resets and signal checks.
*   **Extremely Slow Speeds:** Speeds are consistently far below what you expect, despite good signal and available data.
*   **Unresponsive Device:** The hotspot frequently freezes, or its buttons do not respond.
*   **Forgotten Admin Password:** You cannot access the web interface because you forgot the administrator password.
*   **Selling or Transferring Device:** You want to erase all your personal data before giving the device to someone else.

To perform a factory reset, you usually need to locate a small reset pinhole on the device. Use a paperclip or a thin tool to press and hold the reset button inside the pinhole for about 10-15 seconds. The device lights will usually flash or change, indicating the reset is in progress. Refer to your Orbic RC400L's user manual for the exact location of the reset button and procedure.
