## Stop the Drip: How to Fix Dripping Faucets Quickly

A constant *drip, drip, drip* from your faucet can quickly become maddening. Beyond the annoyance, a dripping faucet wastes a lot of water. It also adds to your utility bill over time. You might be surprised how much water even a slow drip wastes in a single day, week, or month. Learning how to fix dripping faucets is a valuable skill for any homeowner.

This guide will help you understand common causes of faucet drips. We will walk you through the necessary tools. You will learn step-by-step instructions for repairing different types of faucets. By the end, you will feel confident tackling this common household issue yourself. This saves you money and conserves precious water.

### Takeaway:

*   Identify your faucet type to pinpoint the drip's cause.
*   Gather the correct tools and replacement parts before starting.
*   Shut off the water supply before any repair work.
*   Replace worn washers, O-rings, or cartridges to stop most drips.
*   Regular maintenance helps prevent future leaks.

To fix a dripping faucet, first turn off the water supply. Then, disassemble the faucet according to its type (compression, disc, ball, or cartridge). Replace the worn-out internal component, such as a washer, O-ring, or cartridge. Finally, reassemble the faucet and turn the water back on to test the repair.

### Understanding Your Dripping Faucet: Types and Causes

Many homeowners face the challenge of a dripping faucet. Understanding the type of faucet you have helps you pinpoint the problem. It also guides your repair approach. Most household faucets fall into one of four main categories. Each type has specific internal parts that can wear out.

**Common Faucet Types:**

*   **Compression Faucets:** These are older, traditional faucets. They have separate hot and cold handles. You tighten a handle to stop water flow. The drip usually comes from a worn rubber washer at the base of the stem. This washer compresses against a valve seat. It creates a seal. Over time, the rubber degrades. This causes the leak.
*   **Cartridge Faucets:** These faucets have a single handle that controls both water flow and temperature. Inside, a cartridge cylinder moves up and down or rotates. This cartridge houses the mixing and flow mechanisms. A worn or cracked cartridge often causes drips. It can also be due to worn O-rings around the cartridge body. Replacing the entire cartridge is often the solution.
*   **Disk Faucets:** These are modern, single-handle faucets. They feature a wide base. Inside, two ceramic disks slide against each other. Holes in the disks align to control water flow and temperature. Drips usually come from worn seals beneath the ceramic disks. Sometimes, the ceramic disks themselves crack or chip. This disrupts the seal.
*   **Ball Faucets:** These faucets also have a single handle. They are common in kitchens. A rotating metal or plastic ball controls water flow and mixing. Inside, a series of springs and rubber seats surround the ball. Drips often happen when these springs or seats wear out. The ball itself can also corrode.

**Why Faucets Drip:**

A drip generally means an internal seal has failed. Water pressure then forces water past this failed seal. The most common culprits are:

*   **Worn Washers:** Especially in compression faucets, the rubber washer hardens or cracks. This prevents it from forming a tight seal.
*   **Damaged O-Rings:** These small rubber rings seal connections within the faucet body. They can dry out, crack, or slip out of place. This allows water to leak around the spout or handle.
*   **Worn Cartridges or Disks:** Over time, the internal components that control water flow become scratched or damaged. This leads to persistent drips.
*   **Loose Parts:** Screws or nuts holding the faucet together can loosen. This compromises the seal of internal components.
*   **Mineral Buildup:** Hard water deposits can accumulate on faucet parts. This prevents them from seating properly. It causes small gaps for water to escape.

Identifying your faucet type and understanding these common causes will give you a clear starting point for your repair.

### Gathering Your Tools: Essential Items for Faucet Repair

Before you tackle any repair, having the right tools makes the job much smoother. You do not want to stop mid-repair to search for a specific wrench. Gathering everything beforehand saves time and frustration. Most of these tools are common household items. You might already own them.

**Basic Toolkit for Faucet Repair:**

*   **Adjustable Wrench:** This is essential for loosening and tightening nuts on the water supply lines and faucet body. A pipe wrench might also be useful for larger nuts.
*   **Phillips and Flathead Screwdrivers:** You will use these to remove handle screws, decorative caps, and other small fasteners.
*   **Pliers (Channel Locks or Needle-Nose):** Pliers help grip small or oddly shaped parts. Channel locks provide strong grip for larger nuts. Needle-nose pliers are great for tiny springs or O-rings.
*   **Utility Knife or Box Cutter:** Use this for carefully cutting away old sealant or scraping off mineral deposits.
*   **Penetrating Oil (like WD-40):** This helps loosen stubborn or corroded nuts and screws. Apply it and let it sit for a few minutes before trying to turn the part.
*   **Soft Cloths or Rags:** Protect your faucet's finish from scratches. They also help clean parts. Keep a bucket nearby for catching drips or holding small parts.
*   **Flashlight or Headlamp:** This provides essential light when working under a sink or in dimly lit areas.
*   **Small Wire Brush:** Useful for cleaning mineral deposits from threads and internal components.
*   **Replacement Parts:** This is crucial. You will need new washers, O-rings, springs, or a new cartridge specific to your faucet model. It is often best to disassemble first, then buy the exact part. However, if you know your faucet model, you can buy a repair kit beforehand. Sometimes, stores sell [Delta faucets repair kits](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-use-delta-faucets-repair-kits) directly.

**Optional but Helpful Items:**

*   **Plumber's Grease (Silicone Grease):** This non-toxic, waterproof grease lubricates rubber O-rings and washers. It helps them seat properly and last longer. Do not use petroleum jelly, as it can degrade rubber.
*   **Faucet Handle Puller:** For very stubborn handles, this tool helps remove them without damage.
*   **Basin Wrench:** This specialized wrench allows you to reach nuts in tight spaces under the sink.
*   **Safety Glasses:** Protect your eyes from falling debris or splashes.
*   **Old Toothbrush:** Good for scrubbing away grime and mineral deposits.

Before starting any repair, always turn off the water supply to the faucet. Locate the shut-off valves directly under the sink. If your sink does not have individual shut-off valves, you will need to turn off the main water supply to your house. This prevents flooding. Open the faucet handles to drain any remaining water from the lines. Now you are ready to begin the repair process.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Fixing a Compression Faucet Drip

Compression faucets are often found in older homes. They are easy to identify. These faucets typically have two separate handles, one for hot water and one for cold. The drip usually comes from the spout. This indicates a problem with the rubber washer inside. This is one of the simpler faucet repairs you can do.

**Steps to Repair a Compression Faucet:**

1.  **Shut Off Water Supply:** Find the shut-off valves under the sink. Turn them clockwise until they are completely closed. If you cannot find them, turn off the main water supply to your house. This is a very important first step to avoid water damage.
2.  **Drain Remaining Water:** Open both the hot and cold handles on the faucet. Let any water drain out of the lines.
3.  **Remove Handle Caps:** Look for decorative caps on top of the handles. These caps often hide screws. Pry them off gently with a flathead screwdriver or your fingernail.
4.  **Unscrew Handles:** Use a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the screws beneath the caps. Lift the handles off the faucet stem. Sometimes, they might be stuck. A little wiggle or a gentle tap might free them.
5.  **Remove Packing Nut:** You will see a large hexagonal nut around the stem. This is the packing nut. Use an adjustable wrench to loosen and remove it. Be careful not to scratch the faucet finish.
6.  **Pull Out Stem Assembly:** Once the packing nut is off, you can pull the entire stem assembly straight up and out. It might require a little twisting or wiggling.
7.  **Replace Washer and O-Ring:** At the bottom of the stem, you will find a small screw holding a rubber washer. Unscrew it and replace the old washer with a new one. This is the primary culprit for most compression faucet drips. Also, check the O-ring on the stem body. Replace it if it looks worn or cracked. For more detailed guidance on changing these specific components, you can refer to resources like [how to fix a leaking washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-fix-a-leaking-washer).
8.  **Clean and Reassemble:** Clean any mineral buildup from the stem, valve seat, and packing nut. Use a small wire brush or old toothbrush. Apply a thin layer of plumber's grease to the new washer and O-ring. Carefully reinsert the stem assembly into the faucet body. Tighten the packing nut with your wrench. Place the handles back on and secure them with their screws and caps.
9.  **Restore Water Supply and Test:** Slowly turn the water supply valves back on. Check for any leaks. Turn the faucet on and off a few times to ensure it operates smoothly. If there are no drips, you have successfully fixed your compression faucet.

Remember, patience is key. If a part seems stuck, avoid forcing it. A little penetrating oil can help loosen stubborn components.

### Repairing Leaks in Disc Faucets

Disc faucets are a popular choice in modern homes. They feature a single handle and a wide, cylindrical body. Inside, two ceramic discs control water flow and temperature. If your disc faucet is dripping, it usually means the seals around these ceramic discs are worn. Sometimes, the discs themselves can be chipped or cracked. This repair requires careful handling of the ceramic parts.

**Steps to Repair a Disc Faucet:**

1.  **Shut Off Water Supply:** Locate the hot and cold water supply valves under the sink. Turn both valves completely off. If your sink lacks shut-off valves, turn off the main water supply to your house. This prevents accidental water spills during the repair.
2.  **Drain Faucet:** Turn the faucet handle to the "on" position. Allow any remaining water in the lines to drain out. This relieves pressure.
3.  **Remove Handle:** Look for a decorative cap or a small screw on the front or side of the handle base. Pry off the cap gently with a flathead screwdriver. Unscrew the handle screw with a Phillips head screwdriver. Lift the handle straight off the faucet body.
4.  **Remove Set Screws/Retainer Ring:** You will see a cap or cover on top of the faucet body. This might be held by small set screws or simply screw off. Remove it to expose the ceramic disc cylinder. Some faucets have a retainer ring that holds the cylinder in place. Unscrew or unclip this ring.
5.  **Lift Out Ceramic Disc Cylinder:** Carefully lift the entire ceramic disc cylinder out of the faucet body. It should come out as one unit. Note its orientation before removal.
6.  **Inspect and Replace Seals:** At the bottom of the ceramic disc cylinder, you will see rubber seals. These are usually the cause of the drip. Gently pry out the old seals. Clean the area thoroughly. Replace them with new, identical seals. If the ceramic discs themselves appear chipped or scratched, you might need to replace the entire disc cylinder unit. [Moen faucets](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-install-moen-faucets-in-bathroom) often have replacement cartridges with these discs integrated.
7.  **Clean Faucet Body:** Use an old toothbrush or a small wire brush to clean any mineral buildup from the inside of the faucet body where the disc cylinder sits. Ensure the surface is smooth and free of debris.
8.  **Reassemble Faucet:** Carefully place the new seals onto the ceramic disc cylinder. Apply a thin layer of plumber's grease to the seals. Insert the cylinder back into the faucet body, ensuring it is correctly oriented. Secure it with the retainer ring or set screws. Replace the decorative cap and then the handle, tightening its screw.
9.  **Restore Water and Test:** Slowly turn the water supply valves back on. Watch for any immediate leaks. Turn the faucet on and off several times. Check for drips from the spout or around the base of the handle. If the drip has stopped, you have successfully repaired your disc faucet.

Working with ceramic discs requires a light touch. Avoid scratching them, as this can cause new leaks.

### Addressing Drips in Ball Faucets

Ball faucets are common, especially in kitchens. They use a single handle and have a distinctive rotating ball mechanism inside. This ball controls water flow and temperature. If your ball faucet is dripping, the likely culprits are worn-out rubber seats and springs located beneath the ball. Sometimes, the ball itself can be corroded. Repairing a ball faucet involves replacing these small, often overlooked, components.

**Steps to Repair a Ball Faucet:**

1.  **Shut Off Water Supply:** Turn off the hot and cold water supply valves under your sink. If you cannot find these, shut off the main water supply to your house. This prevents any water accidents.
2.  **Drain Faucet:** Open the faucet handle to release any remaining water from the lines. This also relieves pressure inside the faucet.
3.  **Remove Handle:** Use an Allen wrench to loosen the set screw on the side of the handle. Once loose, pull the handle straight up and off the faucet body.
4.  **Remove Cap and Collar:** You will see a large cap directly beneath where the handle was. Use channel-lock pliers to unscrew this cap counter-clockwise. Be gentle to avoid damaging the finish. Beneath the cap, there is usually a "cam" or "collar." Remove this part as well. It might have slots that align with the faucet body.
5.  **Lift Out Ball Assembly:** Carefully lift out the chrome or plastic ball. You might need needle-nose pliers for this. Inspect the ball for any signs of wear, scratches, or corrosion. If it looks damaged, replace it.
6.  **Remove Springs and Seats:** Once the ball is out, you will see two rubber seats and two small springs at the bottom of the faucet body. These are crucial for sealing. Use a flathead screwdriver or needle-nose pliers to pry out the old seats and springs. These are almost always the cause of a ball faucet drip.
7.  **Clean Faucet Body:** Clean any mineral deposits or debris from the inside of the faucet body. Use a small brush. Ensure the areas where the new seats and springs will sit are clean and smooth.
8.  **Install New Seats and Springs:** Place the new springs into their respective holes at the bottom of the faucet body. Then, position the new rubber seats on top of the springs. The wider side of the seat usually faces up.
9.  **Reassemble Faucet:** Drop the ball back into place. Ensure its slot aligns with the pin inside the faucet body. Place the cam or collar back over the ball. Align its slots with the tabs on the faucet body. Screw the cap back on, tightening it with channel-lock pliers. Reinstall the handle and tighten its set screw.
10. **Restore Water and Test:** Slowly turn the hot and cold water supply valves back on. Check for immediate leaks around the faucet base. Turn the faucet on and off several times, testing both hot and cold water flow. If the drip has stopped, your ball faucet repair is complete.

Ball faucet repair kits are readily available. They contain all the necessary springs, seats, and often a new ball. Using a kit specific to your faucet brand ensures proper fit.

### Solving Cartridge Faucet Leaks

Cartridge faucets are very common in bathrooms and kitchens. They use a single lever to control both water flow and temperature. Inside, a cartridge is a self-contained unit that regulates water. If your cartridge faucet is dripping, the problem almost always lies with a worn or faulty cartridge. Replacing the cartridge is the standard fix. This job requires careful observation of how the cartridge is oriented.

**Steps to Replace a Cartridge in a Faucet:**

1.  **Shut Off Water Supply:** Locate the hot and cold water supply valves under the sink. Turn both off by rotating them clockwise. If your sink lacks these valves, turn off the main water supply to your home. This prevents any water damage.
2.  **Drain Faucet:** Open the faucet handle to let any remaining water drain from the lines. This releases pressure and empties the pipes.
3.  **Remove Handle:** There is usually a small decorative cap or screw on the handle. Pry off the cap with a flathead screwdriver. Then, use a Phillips head or Allen wrench to remove the screw. Lift the handle straight off.
4.  **Remove Escutcheon (Decorative Cover):** There might be a decorative cover or dome over the cartridge. This is called an escutcheon. Unscrew it or pry it off carefully.
5.  **Remove Cartridge Retaining Clip or Nut:** Once the cartridge is exposed, you will see a small metal retaining clip or a large retaining nut holding it in place.
    *   **For Clips:** Use needle-nose pliers to pull out the U-shaped retaining clip. Note its orientation.
    *   **For Nuts:** Use a wrench to unscrew the retaining nut.
6.  **Pull Out the Old Cartridge:**
    *   **For Standard Cartridges:** Grip the top of the cartridge with pliers. Pull it straight up and out. It might be stiff from mineral deposits. Wiggle it gently or use a cartridge puller tool if available.
    *   **For Moen Cartridges:** Moen cartridges often require a special tool for removal, or you can use pliers. Note the "H" and "C" markings or the notches for correct reinstallation. For specific instructions, resources like [how to install Moen faucets in bathroom](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-install-moen-faucets-in-bathroom) can offer relevant insight into cartridge orientation.
7.  **Inspect Faucet Body:** Look inside the faucet body where the cartridge sits. Clean any mineral buildup or debris with a small brush.
8.  **Install New Cartridge:** Make sure your new cartridge is the exact replacement for your faucet model. Apply a thin layer of plumber's grease to the O-rings on the new cartridge. Carefully align the notches or markings on the new cartridge with the faucet body. Push it straight down until it seats firmly. It is important to match the "hot" and "cold" indicators if present.
9.  **Secure Cartridge:** Replace the retaining clip or tighten the retaining nut. Ensure the cartridge is held firmly in place.
10. **Reassemble Faucet:** Replace the escutcheon or decorative cover. Put the handle back on and tighten its screw. Replace any decorative caps.
11. **Restore Water and Test:** Slowly turn the hot and cold water supply valves back on. Check for any immediate leaks. Turn the faucet on and off several times to ensure proper operation and check for drips.

Replacing a cartridge is usually a straightforward process. The most important part is getting the correct replacement cartridge for your specific faucet model. Take the old one to the hardware store for an exact match.

### Troubleshooting Other Common Faucet Drip Locations

While most faucet drips originate from the spout due to internal component wear, drips can also occur in other places. These leaks might seem less common. However, they can still waste water and cause damage. Knowing how to identify and address these other drip locations is helpful.

**Drip from the Base of the Spout:**

If water leaks from where the spout meets the faucet body, the O-rings are the likely cause. These O-rings sit on the faucet spout base. They provide a watertight seal when the spout pivots.

*   **Steps to Fix:**
    1.  **Shut off the water** and drain the faucet.
    2.  **Remove the handle** and any decorative caps or nuts around the base of the spout.
    3.  Carefully **lift the spout straight up** and off the faucet body. You might need to gently wiggle it.
    4.  You will see **one or more O-rings** on the spout. Carefully remove the old, worn O-rings using a small flathead screwdriver or utility knife. Be careful not to scratch the spout.
    5.  **Clean the spout** base and the area inside the faucet body where the spout sits. Remove any mineral deposits.
    6.  **Install new O-rings.** Apply a thin coat of plumber's grease to the new O-rings. This helps them slide into place and creates a better seal.
    7.  **Reinsert the spout** into the faucet body. Ensure it seats properly.
    8.  **Reassemble** the rest of the faucet.
    9.  **Restore water** and test for leaks.

**Drip from Around the Faucet Handles:**

A leak around the handle typically means a problem with the packing nut or O-rings on the valve stem. This is common in compression faucets but can happen in others too.

*   **Steps to Fix:**
    1.  **Shut off the water** and drain the faucet.
    2.  **Remove the handle** as described in previous sections.
    3.  **Tighten the packing nut:** Use an adjustable wrench to gently tighten the large packing nut around the valve stem. Sometimes, this is all it needs. Do not overtighten.
    4.  **Replace packing washer/O-ring:** If tightening does not work, you will need to remove the packing nut. Beneath it, you might find a packing washer, packing string, or an O-ring. Replace this worn component. Apply plumber's grease to the new part.
    5.  **Reassemble** the faucet and **restore water** to test.

**Drip from Supply Lines Under the Sink:**

This is not a faucet internal drip, but a leak from the connections. It is important to check these too.

*   **Steps to Fix:**
    1.  **Shut off the water** immediately at the supply valve or main house valve.
    2.  **Inspect the connection:** Check if the nut connecting the supply line to the faucet shank or the shut-off valve is loose.
    3.  **Tighten the nut:** Use an adjustable wrench to carefully tighten the nut. Do not overtighten, as this can strip threads or crack pipes.
    4.  **Check the washer/gasket:** If tightening does not stop the leak, loosen the nut and inspect the rubber washer or gasket inside the connection. Replace it if it is cracked or worn.
    5.  **Use plumber's tape:** For threaded connections, you can wrap plumber's tape (PTFE tape) clockwise around the threads before tightening. This creates a better seal.
    6.  **Restore water** and check for leaks.

Addressing these specific drip locations requires targeted repairs. Always turn off the water before starting any work.

### Preventing Future Faucet Drips and Maintaining Your Fixtures

After successfully fixing a dripping faucet, you want to keep it that way. Regular maintenance and simple habits can significantly extend your faucet's life. This also helps prevent future annoying drips. Proactive care is always better than reactive repairs.

**Tips for Preventing Faucet Drips:**

*   **Do Not Overtighten Handles:** This is a common mistake, especially with compression faucets. Forcing the handle shut wears out washers and seats faster. Turn the handle only until the water stops flowing.
*   **Use Water Softeners (if needed):** Hard water contains minerals that build up inside faucets. These deposits can corrode parts and prevent seals from working correctly. A whole-house water softener can greatly reduce mineral buildup in all your plumbing fixtures.
*   **Regular Cleaning:** Clean your faucets regularly to prevent mineral buildup on external parts. While this does not directly stop internal drips, it helps you spot early signs of wear. You can clean various faucet finishes. For example, knowing [how to clean brushed nickel faucets](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-brushed-nickel-faucets) ensures proper care without damaging the surface.
*   **Inspect Faucets Periodically:** Make it a habit to look at your faucets every few months. Check for any small leaks or signs of wear around the handles or spout base. Early detection makes repairs easier.
*   **Replace Worn Parts Proactively:** If you are already opening a faucet for one repair, inspect other internal components. If a washer or O-ring looks old, cracked, or brittle, consider replacing it even if it is not the primary cause of the current drip.
*   **Use Quality Replacement Parts:** When replacing washers, O-rings, or cartridges, buy good quality parts. Cheap, inferior parts might not last as long. They could lead to another drip sooner.
*   **Lubricate Moving Parts:** Apply plumber's grease (silicone grease) to O-rings and other rubber components during assembly. This lubrication helps them seat properly and reduces friction, extending their lifespan.
*   **Winterize Outdoor Faucets:** While this article focuses on indoor faucets, remember outdoor ones. If you live in a cold climate, prepare your outdoor faucets for winter. Knowing [how to prevent outdoor faucets from freezing](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-prevent-outdoor-faucets-from-freezing) protects them from bursting. A burst pipe can cause significant damage.

**General Faucet Maintenance:**

*   **Clean Aerators Regularly:** The aerator is the screen at the end of the spout. It can collect mineral deposits and debris. Unscrew it and clean it periodically. This improves water flow and prevents splashing.
*   **Avoid Harsh Cleaners:** Do not use abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals on your faucet finishes. These can damage the protective coating. Use mild soap and water or cleaners specifically designed for faucets.
*   **Keep Tools Handy:** Having a basic set of plumbing tools readily available encourages quick repairs. You will be more likely to fix a small drip before it becomes a big problem.

By following these simple prevention and maintenance tips, you can keep your faucets in good working order. This extends their lifespan and keeps your home free from annoying and wasteful drips.

### When to Call a Professional Plumber

While many faucet drips are fixable with DIY methods, some situations warrant calling a professional plumber. Knowing when to stop and seek expert help can save you time, money, and potential damage. Do not hesitate to call a pro if you feel overwhelmed or encounter problems beyond your skill level.

**Signs It Is Time to Call a Plumber:**

*   **Persistent Drips After Repair Attempts:** You followed all the steps
