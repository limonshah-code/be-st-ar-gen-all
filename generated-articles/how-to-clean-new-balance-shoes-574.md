New Balance 574 shoes are a true icon. These sneakers blend classic style with serious comfort. Their versatile design makes them a favorite for many, whether for daily wear or casual outings. But like any frequently worn shoe, your New Balance 574s will eventually show dirt. Keeping them clean is important. This helps them look good and last longer.

You might wonder how to properly clean New Balance shoes 574 given their mix of materials. These shoes often feature a combination of suede, mesh, and synthetic overlays. Each material needs specific care. Using the wrong method can damage your beloved sneakers. I will show you exactly how to clean your New Balance 574s. This guide covers all the steps, from gathering your tools to drying your shoes. You will learn specific techniques for each part of the shoe. Let us get your 574s looking fresh again.

### Takeaway:

*   **Gather Your Tools:** Collect soft brushes, mild cleaning solution, and microfiber cloths before starting.
*   **Dry Brush First:** Always remove loose dirt with a dry brush before applying any liquid.
*   **Clean Materials Separately:** Treat suede, mesh, and rubber components with their specific recommended methods.
*   **Air Dry Safely:** Never use direct heat; stuff shoes with paper towels and let them air dry completely.
*   **Protect After Cleaning:** Apply a suitable protective spray to help repel future dirt and moisture.

To clean New Balance 574 shoes, first remove loose dirt with a dry brush. Then, gently scrub the suede sections with a specialized cleaner and soft brush. Use a mild soap solution for mesh and synthetic parts, wiping clean with a damp cloth. Finally, clean the rubber soles, and air dry your shoes away from direct heat.

### Understanding Your New Balance 574 Materials

The New Balance 574 model is popular for its classic design and comfortable fit. It often features a mix of different materials. Understanding these materials is the first step to cleaning your shoes effectively. Each material needs a specific cleaning approach. Treating all parts the same can cause damage.

The main materials you will find on most 574 shoes include suede, mesh, and synthetic leather. The soles are typically made of rubber or EVA foam. Knowing what part is made of what helps you choose the right cleaning method. This way, you protect the shoe's look and extend its life. Let us break down each common material.

#### New Balance 574 Suede Sections

Many New Balance 574 shoes feature prominent suede sections. Suede is a delicate material. It has a soft, napped surface. This texture can trap dirt and absorb liquids easily. Water can stain suede permanently if not handled correctly. Harsh brushes or strong chemicals can damage the nap.

When you clean suede, you must be very gentle. You need specific tools like a suede brush and eraser. These tools help lift dirt without harming the delicate fibers. Never soak suede. Instead, use minimal moisture and clean in the direction of the nap. Proper care keeps suede looking fresh and soft. For a detailed guide on caring for this material, you can explore tips on [how to clean New Balance suede shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-suede-shoes).

#### New Balance 574 Mesh and Synthetic Overlays

The New Balance 574 often includes mesh panels. These are typically on the toe box and sides. Mesh is a breathable fabric. It allows air to circulate, keeping your feet comfortable. However, mesh can trap dust and small debris easily. Synthetic overlays are often used around the laces or as part of the shoe's structure. These materials are generally more durable than suede. They resist water better.

Cleaning mesh and synthetic parts is usually straightforward. You can use a mild soap solution and a soft brush. The key is to avoid excessive scrubbing that might fray the mesh. You also want to make sure you rinse soap completely. These materials are less prone to water damage. They still benefit from gentle cleaning.

#### New Balance 574 Rubber Midsoles and Outsoles

The New Balance 574 has a substantial rubber midsole and outsole. The midsole provides cushioning. The outsole offers traction. These parts come into direct contact with the ground. They collect the most dirt, mud, and scuffs. The rubber material is durable and less sensitive than the upper materials. It can withstand more rigorous cleaning.

You can use a stiffer brush on the soles. A stronger cleaning solution works well for tough grime. Focus on scrubbing away embedded dirt and scuff marks. A good cleaning of the soles makes a big difference in the overall appearance of your 574s. Regular cleaning of the soles also helps maintain their grip.

### Essential Tools and Cleaning Solutions for New Balance 574s

Before you start cleaning your New Balance 574 shoes, gather all your supplies. Having everything ready makes the process smoother and more efficient. Using the right tools and solutions ensures you clean effectively without causing damage. Do not just grab any household cleaner. Specific shoe cleaning products or gentle alternatives work best.

You do not need a lot of expensive items to get your 574s sparkling. Many essential items are common household products. Some specialized shoe cleaning tools are very helpful, though. Investing in a good shoe cleaning kit is a smart choice for regular maintenance. Here is a list of what you will need.

#### Must-Have Cleaning Tools

Having the right tools is half the battle. These items help you target dirt without harming the shoe materials.

*   **Soft-bristle brush:** This is crucial for the mesh and synthetic parts. A toothbrush or a designated shoe cleaning brush works well. It helps gently scrub away dirt.
*   **Stiff-bristle brush:** Use this specifically for the rubber midsoles and outsoles. Its firm bristles remove tough grime and mud.
*   **Microfiber cloths:** You will need a few of these. They are great for wiping away dirt and excess solution. Microfiber is soft and absorbent.
*   **Suede brush:** This specialized brush has brass or nylon bristles. It lifts dirt from suede nap without damaging it.
*   **Suede eraser:** This looks like a pencil eraser. It helps remove scuff marks and small stains from suede.
*   **Small bowls:** These are useful for mixing cleaning solutions. They also hold water for rinsing.
*   **Paper towels or shoe trees:** These help maintain the shoe's shape during drying. They also absorb moisture.

#### Gentle Cleaning Solutions

The type of cleaning solution you use depends on the shoe material. Always opt for mild options. Strong chemicals can strip colors or damage materials.

*   **Mild dish soap:** A small amount mixed with water works wonders for mesh and synthetic areas. Choose a gentle, dye-free soap.
*   **Specialized shoe cleaner:** Many brands offer cleaners designed for various shoe materials. Look for formulas safe for mixed materials. They often come with instructions.
*   **Suede cleaner:** These are specially formulated liquids for suede. They help lift stains without oversaturating the material.
*   **Rubbing alcohol (for tough sole scuffs):** A small amount on a cotton ball can remove stubborn scuff marks from rubber soles. Use it carefully and only on non-suede parts.
*   **White vinegar (for odors/light stains):** A diluted solution can help with odors or light stains on mesh. Mix equal parts water and white vinegar.

Remember to test any cleaning solution on a small, hidden area of your shoe first. This step ensures it does not cause discoloration or damage. This is especially important for suede. Proper preparation leads to better results.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning New Balance 574 Uppers

Cleaning the upper part of your New Balance 574s requires careful attention. This is where the delicate materials like suede and mesh are located. Rushing this step can lead to damage. I will walk you through each phase. This ensures your uppers are cleaned thoroughly and safely. We will start with dry cleaning. Then we will move to wet cleaning for different materials.

#### Initial Dry Cleaning and Preparation

Before any liquid touches your shoes, remove all loose dirt. This step is critical. It prevents mud and dust from turning into a muddy mess when wet.

1.  **Remove laces and insoles:** Take out the shoelaces and insoles. You will clean these separately. Removing them helps you access all parts of the shoe. It also prevents them from getting soaked or stained during the main cleaning.
2.  **Dry brush the entire shoe:** Use a soft-bristle brush for mesh and synthetic parts. Use a suede brush for suede areas. Gently brush off any loose dirt, dust, or mud. Brush in one direction on suede to lift the nap. Make sure you get into all crevices. This prepares the surface for deeper cleaning. For persistent dirt, consider reading about [how to clean muddy shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-muddy-shoes).

#### Cleaning New Balance 574 Suede Sections

Suede needs special care. It is prone to water stains. Work gently and with minimal moisture.

1.  **Spot treat stains with a suede eraser:** For small scuffs or marks on suede, gently rub them with a suede eraser. Apply light pressure. The eraser lifts the dirt.
2.  **Apply suede cleaner:** If using a specialized suede cleaner, follow its instructions. Usually, you apply a small amount to a clean cloth or brush. Gently rub the cleaner onto the suede. Work in small sections.
3.  **Brush the suede:** Use a suede brush to restore the nap. Brush in a consistent direction after cleaning. This makes the suede look uniform. Do not oversaturate the suede. Water can cause permanent marks. If you need more specific tips on suede care, check out our guide on [how to clean New Balance suede shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-suede-shoes).

#### Cleaning New Balance 574 Mesh and Synthetic Overlays

These materials are more forgiving than suede. You can use a mild cleaning solution.

1.  **Prepare cleaning solution:** Mix a few drops of mild dish soap with warm water in a small bowl. Stir until it is slightly sudsy.
2.  **Dampen your brush:** Dip a soft-bristle brush (like a toothbrush) into the solution. Make sure it is damp, not soaking wet.
3.  **Gently scrub mesh and synthetic areas:** Lightly scrub the mesh and synthetic overlays. Use circular motions or gentle back-and-forth strokes. Focus on dirty spots. Do not press too hard. You want to lift the dirt, not push it deeper.
4.  **Wipe with a clean, damp cloth:** Dip a microfiber cloth in clean water and wring it out well. Wipe away the soap residue and lifted dirt from the mesh and synthetic parts. Rinse the cloth often. Repeat until all soap is gone. For stubborn spots, especially on lighter shoes, you might find tips in our article on [how to clean white shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes). If you face any specific tough spots, guidance on [how to clean stained shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stained-shoes) can be very helpful.

Working patiently on each section helps you achieve the best results. Always be gentle, especially when cleaning delicate parts of your New Balance 574s.

### Revitalizing New Balance 574 Midsoles and Outsoles

The midsoles and outsoles of your New Balance 574s take the brunt of daily wear. They collect dirt, mud, and scuffs more than any other part. Cleaning them effectively makes a huge difference in the shoe's overall appearance. These parts are typically made of rubber or EVA foam. They are much more durable than the upper materials. This means you can use a bit more pressure and stronger cleaning methods here.

A clean sole not only looks better but also performs better. Dirt and debris can reduce traction over time. Let us get those soles looking fresh and new.

#### Cleaning the Midsoles

The midsole is the white or colored foam section between the upper and the outsole. It often collects dirt and scuffs.

1.  **Prepare a stronger solution:** Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with water. For tougher scuffs, you can also use a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a cotton pad.
2.  **Use a stiff brush:** Dip your stiff-bristle brush into the soap solution. Scrub the midsole vigorously. Focus on scuff marks and embedded dirt. The firmer bristles can dislodge grime effectively.
3.  **Wipe clean:** Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth to wipe away the suds and dirt. Rinse the cloth often to avoid spreading dirt around. Repeat until the midsole looks clean. If you are dealing with very deep scuffs, sometimes a specialized shoe cleaner designed for rubber can help.

#### Cleaning the Outsoles

The outsole is the bottom part of the shoe that touches the ground. This part gets the dirtiest.

1.  **Remove large debris:** Before applying liquid, use a stick or the stiff-bristle brush to remove any large pieces of mud, pebbles, or debris stuck in the tread. This makes the cleaning process much easier.
2.  **Apply cleaning solution and scrub:** Apply the same soap solution or a specialized sole cleaner to the outsole. Use your stiff-bristle brush to scrub all areas of the tread. Get into the grooves and patterns. Apply firm pressure to remove all embedded dirt.
3.  **Rinse thoroughly:** You can rinse the outsole under running water if the upper is protected. Or, use a very wet cloth to wipe away all soap residue. Make sure no cleaning solution is left behind. This prevents the soles from becoming slippery. This also helps with the overall process of [how to clean tennis shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-tennis-shoes) effectively.

Remember that while soles are tough, excessive scrubbing with abrasive cleaners can still degrade the material over a long period. Stick to recommended solutions. Regular cleaning of the soles will keep your New Balance 574s looking their best from top to bottom.

### Tackling Tough Stains and Odors in Your New Balance 574s

Sometimes, simple cleaning is not enough. Your New Balance 574s might pick up stubborn stains or develop unpleasant odors. These issues require a targeted approach. Addressing them promptly prevents them from becoming permanent problems. I will guide you through common stain removal techniques and effective odor elimination strategies.

Patience is key when dealing with tough spots. Do not immediately reach for harsh chemicals. Start with the gentlest method first. This reduces the risk of damaging your shoes. Similarly, for odors, focus on neutralizing them, not just masking them.

#### Removing Stubborn Stains

Different stains require different treatments. Identify the type of stain first.

*   **Mud stains:** Let mud dry completely on your New Balance 574s. Once dry, you can easily brush off most of it with a stiff brush. For remaining marks on mesh or synthetic, use a mild soap solution and a soft brush. For mud on suede, use a suede brush and eraser gently. For more comprehensive advice, consider reading our guide on [how to clean muddy shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-muddy-shoes).
*   **Oil/Grease stains:** These are tricky on any shoe material. On mesh or synthetic, apply a small amount of cornstarch or talcum powder directly onto the fresh stain. Let it sit for a few hours or overnight to absorb the oil. Then, brush it off and clean with mild soap and water. For suede, this method is riskier; it is often best to consult a professional or use a specific suede stain remover.
*   **Grass stains:** For mesh and synthetic, a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water can work. Dab it onto the stain with a cloth. Then, gently scrub with a soft brush and rinse. On suede, use a specialized suede cleaner designed for stains.
*   **Ink stains:** These are very difficult. For fresh ink on synthetic, a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab might help, dab, do not rub. On suede, it is generally best to consult a professional or use a specific suede stain remover. Never use harsh solvents.
*   **Yellowing:** If your white soles or mesh parts are yellowing, you can try a mixture of baking soda and a tiny bit of water to form a paste. Apply the paste, let it sit in sunlight for a short time (30-60 minutes, but watch closely), then rinse thoroughly. This can help brighten them. For more tips on this issue, explore our article on [how to clean yellow shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-yellow-shoes).

Always test stain removers on an inconspicuous area first. This applies especially to delicate materials like suede.

#### Eliminating Odors from Your 574s

Unpleasant odors often come from bacteria growing inside the shoes. You need to kill the bacteria and absorb moisture.

1.  **Clean the insoles:** The insoles are major odor culprits. Wash them separately with soap and water. You can scrub them with a brush. Rinse them well and let them air dry completely before putting them back. For detailed insights, our guide on [how to clean the inside of shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes) offers valuable tips.
2.  **Baking soda method:** Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda inside each shoe. Let it sit overnight, or even for 24-48 hours. Baking soda absorbs odors. After, shake out the excess baking soda. You can also vacuum out any remaining powder.
3.  **Activated charcoal inserts:** These small bags absorb odors and moisture very effectively. Place them inside your shoes when not wearing them. They can be reused by recharging them in sunlight.
4.  **Shoe deodorizer sprays:** Many commercial sprays are available. Choose one that targets bacteria, not just masks smells. Spray liberally inside the shoes.
5.  **Air them out:** Regularly air out your New Balance 574s. After wearing them, do not put them straight into a dark closet. Let them breathe in an open area. Sunlight can also help kill bacteria, but avoid direct, prolonged exposure for the whole shoe, especially suede.

If you struggle with persistent bad smells, our comprehensive article on [how to clean smelly shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes) can provide even more solutions. Regular maintenance helps prevent tough stains and odors. Act quickly when they appear. This keeps your 574s looking and smelling fresh.

### Drying and Protecting Your New Balance 574s

After a thorough cleaning, proper drying is just as important as the cleaning itself. Incorrect drying can warp your shoes, damage materials, or lead to mildew. Once dry, protecting your New Balance 574s helps keep them clean longer. It also safeguards them from future dirt and moisture.

This final stage ensures all your hard work pays off. You want your shoes to be completely dry before wearing them or storing them away. Protection adds an extra layer of defense.

#### Safe Drying Methods

Always air dry your New Balance 574 shoes. Avoid direct heat sources at all costs.

1.  **Stuff with paper towels:** Crumple up clean, white paper towels or newspaper and stuff them loosely inside your shoes. This helps absorb internal moisture. It also helps maintain the shoe's shape as it dries. Change the paper towels every few hours if they become saturated.
2.  **Place in a well-ventilated area:** Find a spot with good air circulation. A fan can speed up the process. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can fade colors, especially suede. It can also cause materials to crack or stiffen.
3.  **Allow ample drying time:** Depending on how wet your shoes got, drying can take 24 to 48 hours. Make sure they are completely dry before you wear them or put them away. Moisture trapped inside can lead to odors or mold growth.
4.  **Re-lace and insert insoles:** Once completely dry, put the insoles and laces back into your shoes.

#### Protecting Your New Balance 574s

Once your shoes are clean and dry, take steps to protect them. This will make future cleanings easier and extend their lifespan.

1.  **Apply a protective spray:** Use a water and stain repellent spray. Look for one specifically designed for mixed materials, including suede. Test it on an inconspicuous area first. Apply the spray evenly over the entire shoe surface. Let it dry completely according to the product instructions. This creates a barrier against water, dirt, and stains.
2.  **Use shoe trees:** If you have cedar shoe trees, use them when storing your shoes. They help maintain shape and absorb moisture and odor.
3.  **Store properly:** Store your New Balance 574s in a cool, dry place. Avoid damp basements or hot attics. Keeping them in their original box or a shoe bag can protect them from dust.
4.  **Regular light cleaning:** Do not wait until your shoes are very dirty. A quick wipe-down after each wear with a dry cloth removes surface dust. This prevents dirt from building up. This small habit makes a big difference in the long run.

By following these drying and protection steps, your New Balance 574s will stay looking great for many years to come. This also minimizes the need for deep cleaning.

### What to Avoid When Cleaning New Balance 574 Shoes

While knowing what to do is crucial, understanding what **not** to do is equally important. Certain cleaning methods can severely damage your New Balance 574 shoes. These shoes are made with a combination of delicate and durable materials. Using the wrong approach can lead to irreversible damage. This includes color fading, material shrinkage, or structural weakening.

I will outline common mistakes to avoid. This helps you keep your 574s in prime condition. Steering clear of these pitfalls protects your investment and preserves the classic look of your sneakers.

#### Machine Washing Your New Balance 574s

This is perhaps the biggest mistake people make with sneakers. While some shoes can handle a washing machine, your New Balance 574s generally cannot.

*   **Risk of damage:** The agitation and high temperatures in a washing machine can damage the delicate suede. It can also loosen adhesives, causing parts of the shoe to separate. The foam cushioning can break down. Colors can bleed.
*   **Water saturation:** Machine washing saturates the entire shoe with water. Suede does not react well to being fully soaked. This can lead to stiffness, discoloration, and permanent water stains.
*   **Spin cycle issues:** The harsh spinning can warp the shoe's shape. It can also damage the internal structure.

If you are considering washing shoes in a machine, it's vital to know which materials can handle it. For context on machine washing, you can review our guide on [how to clean shoes in the washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer). However, remember that for your 574s, hand cleaning is always the safest bet.

#### Using Harsh Chemicals or Abrasive Cleaners

Do not reach for strong household cleaners or harsh chemicals.

*   **Bleach:** Never use bleach on any part of your New Balance 574s, especially not on white components. Bleach can cause yellowing, weaken fibers, and damage the suede. It can also strip dyes from colored parts.
*   **Strong detergents or solvents:** Products like laundry detergent, harsh stain removers, or paint thinners are too aggressive. They can strip natural oils from materials, leading to cracking or fading. They can also leave residue that attracts more dirt.
*   **Abrasive scrubbers:** Avoid steel wool, scouring pads, or very stiff brushes on the upper materials. These can scratch synthetic parts, fray mesh, and permanently damage the nap of the suede. Stick to soft brushes and cloths.

#### Drying with Direct Heat

Resist the urge to speed up drying with heat.

*   **Direct sunlight:** While some sunlight can help with odors, prolonged exposure can fade colors, especially on dark suede or vibrant mesh. It can also make rubber or foam brittle.
*   **Hair dryers or heating vents:** Direct heat from these sources can cause materials to shrink, crack, or warp. It can melt adhesives, leading to sole separation.
*   **Clothes dryer:** Absolutely never put your 574s in a clothes dryer. The tumbling action and heat will almost certainly destroy them.

Patience is a virtue when cleaning sneakers. Allow them to air dry naturally in a cool, well-ventilated area. Avoiding these common mistakes will ensure your New Balance 574 shoes remain a stylish and comfortable part of your wardrobe for a long time.

### FAQ Section

#### Can I put New Balance 574 shoes in the washing machine?

#### How often should I clean my New Balance 574s?
The cleaning frequency depends on how often you wear them and what activities you do. For daily wear, a quick dry brush and wipe-down after each use is good. A deep clean every few months, or whenever they look visibly dirty, is sufficient. Regular light cleaning prevents dirt buildup.

#### What is the best way to clean suede on New Balance 574s?
The best way to clean suede is with a specialized suede brush and eraser. Use the brush to remove loose dirt and restore the nap. For tougher marks, gently rub with a suede eraser. For stains, use a suede cleaner specifically designed for the material, applying it sparingly with a clean cloth.

#### How do I remove odors from my New Balance 574s?
To remove odors, first clean the insoles separately with soap and water, then air dry them. Sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes and let it sit overnight to absorb smells. You can also use activated charcoal inserts or shoe deodorizer sprays. Always ensure shoes are completely dry before storage.

#### Can I use bleach on white New Balance 574s?
No, do not use bleach on any part of your New Balance 574s. Bleach is too harsh. It can cause white materials to yellow, weaken fabric fibers, and damage suede. It can also strip original dyes from colored areas. Use a mild soap solution for white mesh and synthetic parts instead.

#### What drying method is best for New Balance 574s?
Air drying is the best method for New Balance 574s. After cleaning, stuff the shoes loosely with clean
