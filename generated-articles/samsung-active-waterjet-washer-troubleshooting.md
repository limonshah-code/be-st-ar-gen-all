## Common Samsung Active Waterjet Washer Problems & Fixes

My laundry pile is growing, and my Samsung Active Waterjet washer isn't cooperating. This powerful washing machine, known for its built-in water faucet for pre-treating clothes, makes laundry easier. However, like any appliance, it can run into issues. Facing a washer problem can feel frustrating and slow down your entire day.

Do you have problems like your washer not starting, not filling, or failing to drain? This comprehensive guide on Samsung Active Waterjet washer troubleshooting helps you. We will go through common problems and provide clear steps to fix them. You can get your machine running smoothly again. I will cover everything from power issues to strange noises and error codes.

### Takeaway

*   Always check basic power and water connections first.
*   Understand common error codes; they tell you the problem.
*   Regular maintenance prevents many washer issues.
*   If DIY steps do not work, consult your owner's manual or professional help.

### Clear Answer

To troubleshoot a Samsung Active Waterjet washer, check power, water supply, and ensure the lid is shut. Common fixes often involve clearing drain filters, leveling the machine, or addressing specific error codes displayed. Basic issues frequently have simple, easy solutions.

## Samsung Active Waterjet Washer Not Starting or No Power

It feels disheartening when your washing machine does not start. A Samsung Active Waterjet washer needs power to work. Power issues are often simple to fix. I always check the power cord first.

### Basic Power Checks

First, make sure the washer is plugged in. The power cord must sit firmly in the wall outlet. Check your home’s circuit breaker panel. A tripped breaker can cut power to the washer. Flip the breaker off, then on again. This often restores power.

Ensure the power outlet itself works. You can plug in another appliance, like a hairdryer, to test it. If the outlet has no power, the issue is with your home’s electrical system. You may need an electrician for this. My washer once did not start, and it was just a tripped breaker.

### Door Latch and Child Lock Issues

A Samsung Active Waterjet washer will not start if its lid is open. The machine has safety features. The lid must close completely for the cycle to begin. Check the door latch; it might be faulty or stuck. If the latch is not working, the washer thinks the door is open.

Sometimes, the child lock feature is active. This prevents children from starting or stopping the washer. Check your washer's control panel for a lock icon. You usually hold two buttons for three seconds to deactivate it. The specific buttons vary by model. Refer to your user manual for exact instructions. It is easy to forget the child lock is on. For more general troubleshooting tips, consider reviewing our guide on [Samsung Top Loader Washing Machine Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/samsung-top-loader-washing-machine-troubleshooting).

## Water Fill Problems: No Water or Slow Filling

My washer needs water to clean clothes. When a Samsung Active Waterjet washer does not fill with water, or fills too slowly, it stops the wash cycle. This problem often relates to water supply or hoses. I remember having this issue, and it was a quick fix.

### Checking Water Supply Lines

First, check your water faucets. Ensure both hot and cold water faucets behind the washer are fully open. Sometimes, they get accidentally turned off. The washer needs good water pressure. If water pressure is low in your home, it can affect the washer’s fill time.

Next, inspect the water inlet hoses. These hoses connect the washer to your home’s water supply. Look for any kinks or bends in the hoses. A kinked hose restricts water flow. Straighten any hoses that are bent. Also, check for any leaks around the hose connections. A small leak might indicate a loose connection.

### Cleaning Inlet Filters

Your Samsung Active Waterjet washer has small screens inside the water inlet valves. These are inlet filters. They catch debris from your water supply. Over time, these filters can become clogged with sediment. Clogged filters restrict water flow to the washer.

To clean them, first turn off the hot and cold water faucets. Disconnect the water inlet hoses from the back of the washer. You will see small screens inside the valve openings. Use needle-nose pliers or tweezers to carefully pull out these filters. Rinse them under running water to remove any debris. You can also use a soft brush. Reinsert the clean filters and reattach the hoses. Turn the water back on. This simple cleaning step often resolves water fill issues. Maintaining these filters is similar to cleaning other parts of your washing machine, like the main filter mentioned in [How to Clean Samsung Washing Machine Filter Top Loader](https://beacleaner.com/samsung-to-loader-washing-machine-filter-cleaning-tips).

## Samsung Active Waterjet Washer Not Draining or Spinning

It is frustrating when your clothes stay soaked after a wash cycle. A Samsung Active Waterjet washer not draining or spinning means the water is stuck. This usually points to a problem with the drain system or an imbalanced load. I've had to deal with this problem before.

### Clogged Drain Filter

Most Samsung washers have a drain pump filter. This filter catches lint, coins, or small items before they enter the drain pump. If this filter gets clogged, water cannot drain properly. The washer will not spin if water remains inside. You can usually find this filter at the bottom front of your washer, behind a small access panel.

To clean it, first place a shallow pan or towels underneath. Open the drain hose cap to drain any standing water. Then, slowly unscrew the filter. Be ready for more water to come out. Remove any debris, lint, or foreign objects from the filter. Rinse the filter thoroughly under water. Screw it back in tightly. This is a common maintenance task, much like cleaning any other drain in your home. You can find more details about general drain cleaning at [How to Clean Washer Drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-drain).

### Drain Hose Obstructions

The drain hose carries water out of your washer to the drain pipe. This hose can become kinked or clogged. Check the entire length of the drain hose. Make sure it is not bent or twisted. Straighten any kinks you find. The end of the drain hose should sit securely in your drain pipe or utility sink.

Sometimes, the drain hose itself gets an obstruction. Lint and detergent residue can build up inside. Disconnect the hose from the washer and the drain. Inspect it for blockages. You can use a long brush or a strong stream of water to clear it. Reconnect the hose securely after checking.

### Unbalanced Loads and Spin Cycle

An unbalanced load is a common reason for a washer not spinning. If all the clothes clump on one side, the washer cannot balance itself. It will stop the spin cycle to prevent damage. Open the lid and redistribute the clothes evenly around the drum. Close the lid and try the spin cycle again.

Too many clothes can also cause an unbalanced load. Overloading the washer prevents proper movement and spin. Remove some items if the load is too large. Washers also need to be level. If the machine wobbles, it cannot spin correctly. Adjust the leveling feet at the bottom of the washer. Ensure all four feet touch the floor firmly.

## Dealing with Common Error Codes on Your Active Waterjet Washer

My Samsung Active Waterjet washer often uses error codes. These codes are like messages. They tell you what is wrong with the machine. Understanding these codes helps you troubleshoot quickly. I once saw a code and knew exactly what to do.

### Understanding Numeric Codes

Samsung washers display various error codes. Each code points to a specific issue. For example, a "4C" or "4E" code often means a water supply problem. This could be low water pressure or a clogged inlet filter. A "5C" or "5E" code indicates a drainage problem. This might mean a clogged drain filter or hose.

The "DC" or "DE" code means the door is open or not latched properly. The "LE" or "LC" code indicates a water leak. This often points to excessive suds or a loose hose connection. "UB" or "UE" signifies an unbalanced load. Knowing these codes directs your troubleshooting efforts. Always check your user manual for a full list of codes specific to your model. Many Samsung washers share common error codes, so guides like [Samsung Top Loader Washing Machine Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/samsung-top-loader-washing-machine-troubleshooting) can be helpful.

### Resetting Your Washer

Sometimes, an error code appears due to a temporary glitch. A simple reset can clear these errors. To reset your Samsung Active Waterjet washer, first unplug it from the wall outlet. Wait for about one to five minutes. This allows the internal system to discharge. Then, plug the washer back in. This soft reset often clears minor electronic issues.

For some errors, you might need a "hard reset." This involves pressing and holding the Power button for several seconds. Some models have a specific "Smart Care" or "Diagnostics" button. Consult your owner's manual for specific reset procedures for your model. If the error code reappears after a reset, the problem is likely a real issue that needs fixing.

## Noisy Operation or Excessive Vibration Issues

A noisy washing machine is annoying. My Samsung Active Waterjet washer should not sound like a freight train. Excessive vibration or loud noises during a cycle suggest an underlying problem. These issues can damage the machine over time. I had a noisy washer, and it was an easy fix.

### Leveling the Washer

One of the most common causes of excessive noise and vibration is an unlevel washer. If the machine rocks or wobbles, it cannot balance itself during the spin cycle. This leads to loud thumping or banging noises. All four feet of the washer must sit firmly on the floor.

You can check the leveling with a spirit level tool. Place the level on top of the washer, from front to back and side to side. Adjust the leveling feet at the bottom of the washer. Most feet screw in or out to raise or lower each corner. Tighten the lock nuts on the feet once the washer is level. This simple adjustment often resolves noise issues. Many types of washers, including front loaders, can suffer from this problem, as discussed in [Whirlpool Front Load Washer Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/whirlpool-front-load-washer-troubleshooting).

### Checking for Shipping Bolts and Objects

New washing machines come with shipping bolts. These bolts stabilize the drum during transport. If these bolts are not removed before use, they can cause extreme vibration and noise. Check the back of your washer for large bolts, usually 4-6 of them. Remove them if they are still there.

Foreign objects inside the drum can also cause noise. Coins, keys, or other small items can fall out of pockets. These items can get stuck between the inner and outer drums. They can create a rattling or scraping sound. Stop the washer immediately if you hear such a sound. Carefully inspect the drum and the space around the agitator. You might need to remove the agitator or access the pump filter to find the object. This is a common issue that can sometimes occur even when you're washing items like shoes, which need proper preparation, as highlighted in [How to Clean Shoes in the Washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer).

## Detergent Dispenser Problems and Water Leaks

It is frustrating when your detergent does not dispense or water leaks from your Samsung Active Waterjet washer. These problems can affect cleaning performance and cause damage. I've dealt with both issues. Knowing the cause helps.

### Clogged Detergent Dispenser

The detergent dispenser can become clogged. Detergent residue, fabric softener, or mold can build up over time. This prevents the dispenser from releasing products properly. You might see detergent left in the tray after a wash. This can lead to poor cleaning and residue on clothes.

To clean the dispenser, remove it from the washer if possible. Many dispensers slide out easily. Wash it thoroughly under hot water. Use a small brush or old toothbrush to scrub away any residue. Make sure all the small holes are clear. Clean the dispenser housing inside the washer as well. For a deeper clean, you can use a mixture of vinegar and water. This helps break down soap scum. For general washing machine cleaning tips, refer to [How to Clean Samsung Washing Machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-samsung-washing-machine).

### Identifying Leak Sources

Water leaks are a serious problem. They can cause floor damage and mold. First, try to find the source of the leak. Look under and around the washer. Check the water inlet hoses at the back. Ensure they are tight at both the washer and the wall connections. The hose washers might be worn out and need replacing.

Next, check the drain hose. Ensure it is properly secured to the drain pipe and the washer. Look for cracks or holes in the hose itself. Excessive suds can also cause leaks. If you use too much detergent, the suds can overflow from the dispenser or the drum. Use only the recommended amount of HE (High-Efficiency) detergent. For general cleaning of your washer that might also prevent some leaks by clearing buildup, consider using vinegar, as described in [How to Clean Washer with Vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-with-vinegar).

## Poor Wash Performance or Residue on Clothes

After a wash cycle, I expect clean clothes. If your Samsung Active Waterjet washer leaves clothes dirty or with residue, something is wrong. This issue affects the very purpose of your washing machine. I can help you figure out why.

### Active Waterjet Function Check

The Active Waterjet feature provides a built-in faucet for pre-treating clothes. If this function is not working, it might affect how well tough stains come out. First, ensure the water supply to the washer is adequate. If water pressure is low, the waterjet might not function optimally.

Check the faucet itself for any clogs or mineral buildup. Hard water can cause deposits to form. You can use a descaling solution or a vinegar-soaked cloth to clean the nozzle. Also, ensure you are using the Active Waterjet function correctly. It is meant for pre-treating, not as a continuous water source during the main wash. If the waterjet flow seems weak, it may indicate a partial clog in the internal water lines.

### Optimizing Wash Settings

Incorrect wash settings can lead to poor cleaning. Make sure you select the right cycle for your load type. Heavy loads need a heavier cycle. Delicate items need a gentle cycle. Using too short a cycle for heavily soiled items will not clean them properly. Always use the recommended water temperature for your fabrics and soil level. Cold water does not dissolve some detergents as well as warm water.

Using too much or too little detergent is a common mistake. Too much detergent creates excessive suds, which can leave residue on clothes. Too little detergent means clothes do not get clean. Always use HE (High-Efficiency) detergent for your Samsung Active Waterjet washer. It produces fewer suds. Also, avoid overloading the washer. An overcrowded drum prevents clothes from tumbling freely and getting clean. Make sure to regularly clean the interior of your washer to remove any residue buildup that could be contributing to the problem. Our guide on [How to Clean Samsung Washing Machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-samsung-washing-machine) offers useful steps for this.
