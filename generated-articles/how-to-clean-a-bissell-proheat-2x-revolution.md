## Clean Your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution

Keeping your home clean is a rewarding task, and a well-maintained carpet cleaner makes it much easier. You invested in a Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution to tackle tough stains and refresh your carpets. But like any powerful tool, it needs regular cleaning itself to perform its best. A dirty machine can spread odors, reduce suction, and even leave residue on your floors.

This guide helps you learn how to clean a Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution step-by-step. We will cover everything from emptying the tanks to scrubbing the brush rolls. I will show you how to properly care for your machine so it continues to deliver outstanding cleaning results. Let us get your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution ready for its next job, ensuring it always cleans, not contaminates.

### Takeaway

*   Empty and rinse dirty and clean water tanks after each use.
*   Remove and clean brush rolls to prevent hair tangles and debris buildup.
*   Clean the nozzle and suction path for consistent performance.
*   Flush the hose and clean attachments thoroughly.
*   Allow all components to air dry completely before reassembling and storing.

To properly clean your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution, you must empty and rinse both water tanks, remove and clear debris from the brush rolls, clean the nozzle, and flush the hose and attachments. This routine cleaning prevents odor, maintains suction, and extends the life of your carpet cleaner.

### Why Cleaning Your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution Is Key

Your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution works hard to remove dirt, grime, and allergens from your carpets. Over time, these collected particles can build up inside the machine itself. This buildup affects how well your cleaner works. It is important to clean your machine regularly to keep it running smoothly.

A dirty carpet cleaner can lose suction power. Debris can block the air pathways and nozzles. This means your machine will not pick up as much dirty water or clean as effectively. I always make sure to clear these blockages.

Lingering moisture and dirt inside the tanks or hoses can also lead to foul odors. This smell then transfers to your freshly cleaned carpets. Nobody wants their home to smell musty after cleaning, so proper cleaning is vital. Cleaning your machine helps you avoid this problem.

Regular cleaning also helps prolong the life of your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution. Dirt and debris can wear down moving parts like brush rolls and motors. Keeping these components clean reduces strain on the machine. This helps save you money on repairs or replacements down the line. It is a simple step that makes a big difference.

Think of it like car maintenance. You change the oil and clean your car to keep it running well. Your carpet cleaner also needs this kind of care. A clean machine is a happy machine, and it helps you maintain a truly clean home.

### Essential Tools And Supplies For Cleaning

Before you start cleaning your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution, gather everything you need. Having the right tools makes the process much smoother and more effective. You likely have most of these items already around your house. I always make sure I have these things ready.

First, you need a few soft cloths or old towels. These are perfect for wiping down surfaces and absorbing excess water. Paper towels also work well for quick clean-ups. Make sure they are lint-free so they do not leave fibers behind.

Next, get a small brush or an old toothbrush. These are incredibly useful for scrubbing stubborn dirt and hair from tight spots. The brush rolls and nozzles often collect a lot of debris, and a small brush can reach those areas easily. I find an old toothbrush works perfectly for getting into small crevices.

You will also need a mild dish soap or a specialized cleaner designed for carpet cleaner parts. Avoid harsh chemicals as these can damage plastic components or leave a residue. Warm water is essential for rinsing and breaking down dried-on dirt. A bucket or sink helps with rinsing larger parts.

A pair of scissors or a seam ripper is handy for cutting away tangled hair from the brush rolls. Hair can wrap tightly around the brushes, making them hard to remove. A sharp pair of scissors cuts through this hair quickly and safely. This tool is a must-have for proper brush roll maintenance.

Finally, consider having a pair of gloves. This protects your hands from dirty water and any cleaning solutions you might use. It also makes the cleaning process more pleasant. With these simple tools, you are ready to give your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution the thorough cleaning it deserves.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Emptying And Rinsing Tanks

The first step in cleaning your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution involves handling the water tanks. This is a critical initial step after every cleaning session. It prevents dirty water from sitting and causing odors or blockages. I always start here immediately after I finish cleaning carpets.

Begin by unplugging your machine from the wall outlet. Safety comes first, and this ensures no accidental starts. Make sure the power is off before you touch any parts. This simple action keeps you safe during the cleaning process.

Next, remove the dirty water tank. This tank typically unlatches from the front of the machine. Carefully lift it away, making sure not to spill any contents. The dirty water contains all the grime your machine picked up from your carpets.

Take the dirty tank to a utility sink or toilet. Pour out all the dirty water. You will likely see a murky, dark liquid, which shows how well your machine worked. Rinse the inside of the tank thoroughly with clean, warm water. Swish the water around to dislodge any remaining dirt or debris. You can also use a mild dish soap if the tank feels slimy. Make sure to rinse until all soap residue is gone.

Now, turn your attention to the clean water tank. This tank might also have some leftover cleaning solution. Empty any remaining solution from this tank. Rinse it out with clean, warm water as well. This prevents any old solution from contaminating your next cleaning mix. Some models, like the [Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-proheat-pet-turbo), have similar tank designs, making this process familiar.

After rinsing, allow both tanks to air dry completely. You can place them upside down in a sink or on a drying rack. Air drying prevents mildew and unpleasant smells from forming. Do not reassemble them until they are fully dry. This ensures your machine stays fresh and ready for its next use.

### Cleaning The Brush Rolls And Nozzle

The brush rolls and nozzle are vital parts of your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution's cleaning power. They pick up dirt and water, so they often accumulate hair, lint, and debris. Keeping them clean ensures effective suction and scrubbing. I find this step makes the biggest difference in performance.

First, ensure the machine is unplugged for safety. Then, you need to access the brush roll area. On the Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution, this often involves reclining the handle and removing the nozzle cover. Some models might require unscrewing a few fasteners. Refer to your user manual if you are unsure how to open this section. For a more detailed look at disassembly, check out [how to take apart a Bissell carpet cleaner to clean](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-take-apart-bissell-carpet-cleaner-to-clean).

Once the cover is off, carefully remove the brush rolls. They usually snap out or slide off their mounts. You will likely see a lot of tangled hair, carpet fibers, and other debris wrapped around them. Use a pair of scissors or a seam ripper to cut through the hair. Pull all the tangled material off the bristles. Be thorough, as even small amounts of hair can hinder rotation.

After removing the debris, rinse the brush rolls under warm running water. Use a small brush or old toothbrush to scrub the bristles and plastic parts. Remove any remaining dirt or cleaning solution residue. Make sure the bristles are free of any stickiness.

Next, clean the nozzle and the suction path. The nozzle is the clear plastic part that sits over the brush rolls. It helps direct the dirty water into the recovery tank. Wipe the inside and outside of the nozzle with a damp cloth. Check for any clogs in the suction pathway, which is the channel leading from the nozzle to the dirty water tank. Use a narrow brush or even a straightened paper clip to clear any blockages. This ensures strong suction.

Allow the brush rolls and nozzle to air dry completely before reassembling them. Lay them on a clean towel in a well-ventilated area. Drying prevents mildew and ensures the parts do not rust. Once dry, carefully reattach the brush rolls and replace the nozzle cover. This thorough cleaning brings back your machine's full cleaning power.

### Maintaining The Hose And Attachments

Many Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution models come with a hose and various attachments for spot cleaning or upholstery. These tools also need proper cleaning to prevent odors and maintain effectiveness. Neglecting them can lead to dirt or mold growth, which then transfers to the surfaces you clean. I make sure to clean these parts regularly.

After using the hose and attachments, disconnect them from the main machine. Begin by flushing the hose. Fill the clean water tank with warm water, possibly adding a small amount of Bissell cleaning solution or mild soap. Attach the hose to the machine. Direct the hose into a sink or bucket and turn on the machine's spray function. Run the water through the hose until it runs clear. This flushes out any dirty water or residue left inside.

Next, clean the attachments themselves. This usually includes tools for stairs, upholstery, or crevices. For each attachment, disassemble it as much as possible. Many have clear covers or nozzles that can be removed. Rinse all parts under warm running water. Use a small brush or old toothbrush to scrub away dirt, hair, or debris from the nozzles and brush parts. Pay special attention to any suction openings, making sure they are clear. If you often clean furniture, refer to our guide on [how to clean a couch with a Bissell Little Green](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-couch-with-bissell-little-green), as the attachment cleaning principles are similar.

If you notice a persistent odor, you can soak the plastic attachments in a solution of warm water and a small amount of white vinegar. Let them sit for about 15-30 minutes. This helps to neutralize odors and kill mildew. Afterwards, rinse them thoroughly with clean water.

Once all parts are clean, allow them to air dry completely. Lay them out on a clean towel or drying rack in a well-ventilated area. Ensure there is no moisture left inside the hose or any attachment crevices. Reassemble them only when fully dry. Proper drying prevents mold and keeps your tools ready for the next job. This consistent care keeps your attachments performing effectively.

### Cleaning Filters And External Components

Your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution has various filters and external parts that also require attention. These components prevent debris from entering the motor and keep the machine looking good. Cleaning them ensures the air flow is not restricted and keeps your cleaner in top shape. I always include these in my cleaning routine.

First, identify if your model has a motor filter. Some Bissell models include a small filter, often located near the dirty water tank or under a separate cover. Refer to your user manual to locate it. This filter traps fine particles and protects the motor. If your machine has one, carefully remove it. Many filters are washable. Rinse it under warm water until clear, then allow it to air dry completely before replacing. If it is a non-washable filter, gently tap it to dislodge dust or replace it if heavily soiled.

Next, clean the exterior of your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution. The outer casing can collect dust, spills, and dirt from use. Use a damp cloth to wipe down all plastic surfaces. Pay attention to the handle, wheels, and any crevices where dirt might accumulate. You can use a mild all-purpose cleaner for stubborn spots, but avoid abrasive cleaners. Ensure no water gets into the electrical components or openings. This external cleaning makes your machine look new again.

Wipe down the power cord as well. It can get dirty from dragging across floors. Check the cord for any signs of damage like frayed wires. If you find damage, do not use the machine until it is repaired or replaced. Safety is always paramount.

Inspect the wheels. Hair and debris can often get tangled around the wheel axles. Carefully remove any accumulated hair or lint. A small brush or even tweezers can help with this. Clean wheels ensure your machine glides smoothly across carpets.

Finally, ensure all components are fully dry before reassembling or storing the machine. Moisture left inside can lead to mold or damage. A clean exterior and functional filters contribute to the overall performance and longevity of your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution. This complete approach ensures your carpet cleaner is always ready.

### Drying And Storing Your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution

After thoroughly cleaning all components of your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution, proper drying and storage are essential. This final step prevents mildew, odors, and potential damage to the machine. Rushing this part can undo all your hard cleaning work. I make sure everything is completely dry before putting it away.

Once you have cleaned the tanks, brush rolls, nozzle, hose, and attachments, lay them out to air dry. Find a clean, well-ventilated area for this. A utility sink, a large drying rack, or even a clean towel on the floor works well. Arrange the parts so air can circulate around them. This helps speed up the drying process. Do not put them back on the machine while wet.

Drying usually takes several hours, sometimes overnight, depending on humidity levels. You can use a fan to accelerate drying. Ensure there is no residual moisture in any crevices or inside the hose. Any trapped water can lead to unpleasant smells or the growth of mold and mildew. This can then transfer to your carpets during the next cleaning cycle.

Once every component is completely dry, you can reassemble your Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution. Snap the brush rolls back into place. Reattach the nozzle cover. Place the clean and dirty water tanks back onto the machine. Ensure all parts fit securely. Reassembling it dry helps keep it fresh and ready.

Store your clean and dry Bissell Proheat 2x Revolution in a cool, dry place. Avoid areas with extreme temperatures or high humidity, like garages that get very damp. A closet or a utility room is often ideal. Storing it properly protects the internal components and prevents dust buildup. Keep it upright and stable to avoid any accidental tipping.

Proper drying and storage are simple steps, but they significantly extend the life and performance of your carpet cleaner. It ensures your machine remains fresh, odor-free, and always prepared to tackle your toughest carpet stains. This care translates to cleaner carpets every time you use it.
