## Understanding PFAS: The "Forever Chemicals" in Our Water

PFAS are a group of man-made chemicals. They have been used in industry and consumer products since the 1940s. You find them in non-stick cookware, waterproof fabrics, and firefighting foam. Their chemical bonds are very strong. This makes them resistant to breaking down in the environment. This is why people call them "forever chemicals."

PFAS can get into our water sources. Manufacturing sites release them. Firefighting training areas are another source. Landfills can also leach PFAS into groundwater. Once in the water, they spread easily. They can contaminate public drinking water supplies.

### What Are PFAS?

PFAS stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. These chemicals have unique properties. They repel oil, grease, and water. This makes them useful for many products. Common types include PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid). Many companies no longer produce these specific types. However, thousands of other PFAS chemicals still exist.

These chemicals persist in the environment. They also persist in our bodies. Exposure can happen through drinking contaminated water. It can also occur through contaminated food. Even air or dust can carry them.

### Why PFAS Removal Matters

Research links PFAS exposure to health concerns. These concerns include thyroid issues and increased cholesterol levels. Some studies suggest a link to certain cancers. Kidney and testicular cancers are examples. They can also affect the immune system. They may impact development in children.

Children and pregnant women are especially vulnerable. Because PFAS build up over time, even small exposures matter. Removing PFAS from drinking water is a critical step. It helps reduce overall exposure. This protects public health. Water filtration plays a key role here.

## ZeroWater's Revolutionary 5-Stage Filtration System

ZeroWater filters stand out with their unique design. They use a comprehensive 5-stage filtration system. This system is different from many other filters. It targets a wide range of dissolved solids. This includes PFAS and heavy metals. The goal is to deliver water with virtually no dissolved solids.

The filtration process works by passing water through multiple layers. Each layer has a specific function. This multi-stage approach ensures thorough purification. The system combines different filtration methods. This makes it highly effective. It removes impurities that other filters often miss.

### Stage 1: Coarse Filter Screen

The first stage is a coarse filter screen. This layer removes large suspended particles. It catches debris like dust and rust. This initial filtering protects the later stages. It prevents clogging of the finer filters. This prolongs the life of the entire system.

This stage acts as a pre-filter. It prepares the water for deeper purification. It ensures smooth water flow. Without it, larger particles would quickly saturate the subsequent layers. This stage is crucial for overall filter efficiency.

### Stage 2: Foam Distribution Layer

Following the coarse filter is a foam distribution layer. This layer serves two main purposes. First, it helps to evenly distribute water. This ensures water passes through the subsequent stages efficiently. Second, it acts as an additional physical barrier. It captures any remaining smaller suspended solids.

Even water distribution is key. It maximizes contact time with the filter media. This leads to more effective removal of contaminants. It also prevents channeling. Channeling occurs when water bypasses parts of the filter media. This layer helps optimize performance.

### Stage 3: Multi-layer Activated Carbon & Oxidation Reduction Alloy

The third stage combines two powerful media. It uses activated carbon and an oxidation reduction alloy. Activated carbon is excellent at adsorbing organic compounds. This includes chlorine, chloramines, pesticides, and herbicides. It also tackles bad tastes and odors.

The oxidation reduction alloy helps reduce inorganic contaminants. It targets metals like lead, chromium, and mercury. It changes their chemical structure. This makes them easier to remove. This dual action stage is critical for broad spectrum contaminant reduction.

### Stage 4: Dual Ion-Exchange Resin

The fourth stage features a dual ion-exchange resin. This is where ZeroWater's unique strength lies. Ion-exchange resins work by swapping ions. They remove harmful dissolved solids. These include heavy metals and non-metal inorganic compounds. This is also where PFAS are effectively captured.

The resin attracts positively and negatively charged contaminants. It releases harmless hydrogen and hydroxide ions in exchange. These combine to form pure water. This stage is highly effective at reducing Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) to near zero. It is crucial for the removal of stubborn chemicals like PFAS.

### Stage 5: Non-Woven Membrane

The final stage is a fine, non-woven membrane. This membrane provides an additional layer of filtration. It removes any remaining tiny particles. It also prevents filter media from escaping into your water. This ensures your water is exceptionally clear.

This last barrier polishes the water. It ensures the highest purity. It confirms the effectiveness of the preceding stages. The result is water that tastes clean and pure. It confirms the entire system works as intended.
