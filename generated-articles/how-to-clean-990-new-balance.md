### How to Clean New Balance 990s?

To clean New Balance 990s, start by dry brushing loose dirt from suede and mesh. Then, mix a gentle cleaning solution with water. Use a soft brush to scrub dirt from the upper materials and sole. Rinse the brush, wipe shoes clean with a microfiber cloth, and let them air dry away from heat.

## Essential Tools for Cleaning Your 990 New Balance Sneakers

Before you begin cleaning your New Balance 990 sneakers, gathering the right tools is important. Having everything prepared makes the cleaning process smooth and efficient. You do not need many specialized items, but the right ones make a difference. Using the correct tools prevents damage to the delicate materials found on your 990s. This ensures a safe and effective clean every time.

Your cleaning kit should include a few basic but essential items. I always start by laying out my tools. A soft-bristle brush is crucial for the upper materials. A stiffer brush works well for the soles. These brushes help lift dirt without harming the shoe's surface. Choosing the right brush type for each part of the shoe ensures thorough cleaning.

Here is a list of tools I recommend:

*   **Soft-bristle brush:** This is ideal for suede, mesh, and other delicate fabrics. You can use an old toothbrush if you do not have a shoe-specific one.
*   **Stiffer brush:** A stiffer brush is great for scrubbing the rubber soles and midsoles. These areas can hold stubborn dirt.
*   **Microfiber cloths:** You will need a few clean cloths. These are for wiping away dirt and excess solution. They also help dry the shoes.
*   **Gentle shoe cleaning solution:** Look for a solution designed for sneakers. You can also mix a small amount of mild dish soap with water.
*   **Small bowls:** Use these for mixing your cleaning solution. One for solution, one for clean water.
*   **Shoe trees or crumpled paper:** These help maintain the shoe's shape during drying.
*   **Protective spray:** This is for future protection after cleaning.

Having these items ready saves time. It also helps you tackle any dirt your New Balance 990s have collected. Remember, the goal is to clean without causing harm. Prepare your tools well before starting.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning 990 New Balance Uppers

Cleaning the upper part of your 990 New Balance sneakers requires a gentle touch. The 990s often feature a mix of suede, mesh, and synthetic overlays. Each material needs specific care. My main goal is always to protect these materials while removing dirt. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process.

**1. Remove Laces and Insoles:**
First, take out the laces and insoles from your shoes. This allows you to clean all parts of the shoe thoroughly. You can clean the laces separately. Put them in a mesh bag and machine wash them with a gentle cycle or hand wash them. The insoles can be wiped down with a damp cloth and mild soap. This helps remove foot odor.

**2. Dry Brush Loose Dirt:**
Use a soft-bristle brush to gently brush off any loose dirt or debris from the upper. Brush in one direction to lift dirt. For suede, brush with the nap. This prevents scratching or damaging the material. This step is crucial for preventing dirt from turning into mud once wet.

**3. Prepare Cleaning Solution:**
Mix a small amount of gentle shoe cleaning solution with water in a bowl. Follow the product's instructions for the correct ratio. If using mild dish soap, a few drops in a cup of water is usually enough. You want a foamy, not overly soapy, mixture.

**4. Clean Mesh Areas:**
Dip your soft-bristle brush into the solution. Gently scrub the mesh areas in a circular motion. The mesh is durable but can tear if scrubbed too hard. Focus on lifting the dirt from the fibers. Wipe away any excess foam with a clean microfiber cloth as you go.

**5. Clean Suede Areas:**
Suede is sensitive and needs extra care. Use a very small amount of cleaning solution on your soft brush. Gently dab and brush the suede in short strokes. Do not saturate the suede. Too much water can stain or harden the material. For stubborn suede stains, you might consider a specialized suede cleaner or eraser. You can learn more about specific techniques for cleaning suede from [how to clean new balance suede shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-suede-shoes).

**6. Clean Synthetic Overlays:**
For synthetic parts, you can scrub a bit more firmly. Use the same soft-bristle brush and solution. These materials are generally more resilient. Wipe thoroughly with a clean, damp cloth afterwards.

**7. Wipe Down Entire Upper:**
Once you have scrubbed all areas, use a clean, damp microfiber cloth to wipe down the entire upper. Remove all soap residue. Make sure no dirty water remains on the shoe. This final wipe helps achieve a clean finish. Take your time to get all the grime off.

## Deep Cleaning the Soles and Midsoles of Your 990s

The soles and midsoles of your New Balance 990s often collect the most dirt. They come into direct contact with the ground. Cleaning these parts effectively can make a huge difference in how clean your shoes look. This section focuses on giving your soles a thorough deep clean. My experience shows that a dedicated approach here yields the best results.

**1. Prepare the Soles:**
Before applying any liquid, knock off any loose dirt, mud, or pebbles from the outsole. You can use a stiffer brush or even a toothpick for this. Pay special attention to the grooves and treads where dirt gets stuck. This initial step makes later cleaning much easier.

**2. Apply Cleaning Solution:**
Mix a stronger concentration of your cleaning solution for the soles. You can use slightly more soap or a dedicated sole cleaner. Apply the solution directly to the midsole and outsole. Let it sit for a minute or two. This helps loosen stubborn grime.

**3. Scrub the Midsoles:**
The midsole is usually white or light-colored. It often shows dirt easily. Use a medium-stiff brush or an old toothbrush. Scrub the midsole vigorously in circular motions. Focus on scuff marks and yellowing areas. For white midsoles that are particularly dirty, a magic eraser can work wonders. I have seen many white midsoles regain their bright appearance this way. For specific tips on keeping other white New Balance models clean, check out [how to clean white new balance shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-new-balance-shoes).

**4. Scrub the Outsoles:**
The outsole (bottom part) is designed for traction. It has deep grooves that trap dirt. Use a stiff brush and scrub hard. Make sure to get into all the crevices. Rinse the brush frequently in clean water to prevent spreading dirt. You can even use a small pick or an old screwdriver to dislodge packed-in dirt if needed.

**5. Rinse and Wipe:**
Once you have scrubbed both the midsole and outsole, wipe them down thoroughly. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth. Make sure all soap residue and loosened dirt are gone. Rinse the cloth often to keep it clean. You want the soles to be spotless before drying.

**6. Check for Stubborn Stains:**
After wiping, inspect the soles for any remaining stains. For very tough marks, you might need to repeat the scrubbing process. Sometimes, a paste of baking soda and a small amount of water can help lift dark stains from rubber soles. Apply the paste, let it sit, then scrub. This method often works well on various shoe models, including other New Balance shoes like the 990v5. Many of these cleaning principles apply across the entire line, such as with [how to clean new balance 990v5](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-990v5).

## Drying and Protecting Your Clean New Balance 990s

After a thorough cleaning, proper drying and protection are essential steps. Incorrect drying can damage your New Balance 990s. It can cause shrinkage, cracking, or material degradation. Protecting your shoes after they are clean helps them stay cleaner longer. I always stress the importance of these final stages.

**1. Air Drying is Key:**
Never put your 990 New Balance sneakers in a washing machine or tumble dryer. The heat can melt adhesives, shrink materials, or warp the shoe's shape. High temperatures are very damaging to the delicate components of athletic shoes. Always air dry your shoes. This is the safest and most effective method.

**2. Prepare for Drying:**
Stuff your shoes with shoe trees or crumpled paper towels. This helps absorb internal moisture. It also helps maintain the shoe's original shape as it dries. Avoid using newspaper, as the ink can transfer to the shoe's interior. Position the shoes in a well-ventilated area.

**3. Choose the Right Location:**
Place your 990s in a spot with good airflow. A shaded area outdoors or indoors near a fan works well. Avoid direct sunlight. Direct sunlight can fade colors, especially on suede. It can also cause materials to become brittle. Allow plenty of time for drying. Depending on the humidity, this can take 24 to 48 hours. Make sure they are completely dry before wearing them.

**4. Re-lace and Inspect:**
Once fully dry, re-lace your shoes. Inspect them closely. Look for any missed spots or areas that need a touch-up. This is your chance to admire your freshly cleaned 990s. Make sure everything looks perfect.

**5. Apply Protective Spray:**
Once the shoes are completely dry, apply a high-quality shoe protector spray. Choose one designed for multiple materials, especially suede and mesh. These sprays create a barrier. This barrier repels water and stains. Follow the product's instructions carefully for application. Typically, you spray evenly from a distance. Let the first coat dry, then apply a second if recommended. This protective layer is a game-changer. It significantly extends the time between deep cleans. It also makes future cleaning much easier. This step is a vital part of long-term New Balance shoe care.

## Specific Care for Suede and Mesh on Your 990s

The New Balance 990 series often features a combination of premium suede and breathable mesh. Each material has unique cleaning needs. Treating them correctly is crucial to avoid damage and keep your shoes looking their best. I always focus on specific care for these key materials. This ensures their longevity and appearance.

### Caring for Suede

Suede is a delicate material known for its soft, napped finish. It can be easily stained and is sensitive to water. My advice for suede is always to be gentle.

*   **Dry Cleaning First:** Always start by dry brushing suede with a soft brush. Use short, gentle strokes in the direction of the nap. This helps remove loose dirt without pushing it deeper into the fibers. A dedicated suede brush with rubber bristles is ideal for this.
*   **Targeted Stain Removal:** For stubborn stains on suede, a suede eraser can be highly effective. Gently rub the eraser over the stain. Then, brush away the residue. For more detailed insights into suede cleaning, you can refer to [how to clean new balance suede shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-suede-shoes).
*   **Minimal Moisture:** If you must use a liquid cleaner, apply it sparingly. Use a damp (not wet) cloth or a brush with minimal solution. Dab the stained area rather than scrubbing vigorously. Too much moisture can cause water spots or stiffen the suede. Allow it to air dry naturally.
*   **Restore Nap:** After cleaning and drying, use a suede brush to restore the nap. Gently brush the suede back and forth. This brings back its soft, velvety texture.

### Caring for Mesh

Mesh is a breathable and lightweight material. It is more durable than suede but can trap dirt within its weave.

*   **Gentle Brushing:** Use a soft-bristle brush to dislodge dirt from the mesh. You can be a little firmer than with suede. Work in small circular motions to lift dirt from the weave.
*   **Foaming Solution:** A gentle foaming shoe cleaner works well on mesh. Apply the foam to the mesh and gently scrub with a soft brush. The foam helps encapsulate the dirt.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** After scrubbing, wipe down the mesh with a clean, damp microfiber cloth. Ensure all soap residue is removed. Residue can attract more dirt over time.
*   **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Do not use harsh chemicals or bleach on mesh. They can weaken the material or cause discoloration. Stick to mild, pH-neutral cleaners.
*   **Air Dry:** Always air dry mesh shoes completely. Stuff them with paper towels to absorb moisture and maintain shape.

By giving specific attention to suede and mesh, you ensure your New Balance 990s retain their original look. Proper care for these materials extends the life of your beloved sneakers.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning 990 New Balance Shoes

Cleaning your New Balance 990s can be simple, but certain mistakes can cause irreversible damage. I have seen many good pairs ruined by improper cleaning methods. Avoiding these common pitfalls ensures your sneakers stay in prime condition. Knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do.

**1. Using Harsh Chemicals or Bleach:**
Never use household cleaning products like bleach, strong detergents, or harsh chemicals. These products are too aggressive for shoe materials. They can strip colors, damage adhesives, or cause yellowing, especially on white parts. Stick to mild, pH-neutral shoe cleaners specifically designed for sneakers.

**2. Machine Washing Your Shoes:**
Putting your 990s in a washing machine is a big no-no. The agitation and spin cycle can pull seams apart. It can also warp the shoe's shape and damage the internal structure. It can also harm the delicate suede and mesh components. Always hand wash your New Balance 990s.

**3. Drying with Direct Heat:**
Avoid using direct heat sources like a clothes dryer, hairdryer, or direct sunlight. High heat can cause the glue to weaken, leading to sole separation. It can also shrink or crack the leather and suede. Always air dry your shoes in a well-ventilated area. Stuffing them with crumpled paper or shoe trees helps absorb moisture and maintain shape.

**4. Over-Saturating Suede:**
Suede is very sensitive to water. Applying too much liquid cleaner will cause water stains. It can also make the suede stiff or discolor it. Use minimal moisture when cleaning suede sections. Dab with a damp cloth or use a dedicated suede cleaner. Brush gently to avoid flattening the nap.

**5. Scrubbing Too Hard:**
While soles can withstand firm scrubbing, the upper materials like mesh and suede cannot. Scrubbing too aggressively can damage the fibers. It can also cause pilling on mesh or wear down the suede. Use a soft-bristle brush and gentle motions. Let the cleaning solution do most of the work.

**6. Ignoring Pre-Cleaning Steps:**
Skipping the dry brushing step is a common mistake. If you do not remove loose dirt first, you risk turning it into muddy stains when you add water. Always dry brush your shoes thoroughly before introducing any liquid.

**7. Not Rinsing Properly:**
Leaving soap residue on your shoes can attract more dirt over time. It can also leave a sticky film. Always wipe down your shoes with a clean, damp cloth after scrubbing. Ensure all cleaning solution is removed.

By being mindful of these mistakes, you can protect your New Balance 990s. You will keep them looking great for many years to come. Proper care is key to maintaining their iconic appeal and comfort.

## Maintaining Your 990s Between Deep Cleans

Keeping your New Balance 990s looking good is not just about deep cleaning. Regular maintenance between major cleaning sessions is crucial. Small habits can prevent significant dirt buildup. This makes your deep cleans easier and less frequent. I believe in proactive shoe care. It really saves time and extends the life of your sneakers.

**1. Wipe After Each Wear:**
Make it a habit to wipe down your shoes after each wear. Use a dry cloth or a slightly damp one. This removes fresh dust and light dirt before it sets in. This simple step prevents dirt from embedding deep into the materials. It takes only a minute but makes a big difference.

**2. Use a Shoe Protector Spray Regularly:**
After your initial deep clean and protection, reapply a protective spray periodically. How often depends on how often you wear your shoes and the conditions. For frequent wear, reapply every few weeks or months. This barrier helps repel water, dirt, and stains. It is a vital defense against everyday grime.

**3. Store Properly:**
When you are not wearing your 990s, store them in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight or humid environments. Humidity can promote mildew growth. Sunlight can fade colors. Using shoe trees helps maintain their shape and absorb moisture. Keeping them in their original box or a shoe bag also protects them from dust.

**4. Address Spills Immediately:**
If you spill something on your 990s, act fast. Blot the spill immediately with a clean, dry cloth. Do not rub, as this can spread the stain. For liquid spills, blot as much as possible, then gently dab with a slightly damp cloth. For oil-based stains, sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder. Let it sit to absorb the oil, then brush off. Quick action prevents stains from setting.

**5. Rotate Your Sneakers:**
If you have multiple pairs of sneakers, rotate them. Giving your 990s a break allows them to air out completely. It also reduces wear and tear on any single pair. This extends the lifespan of all your shoes.

**6. Clean Laces Separately:**
Laces get dirty quickly. You can remove them and hand wash them with a mild soap. This keeps the entire shoe looking fresh. You can also machine wash them in a mesh bag on a gentle cycle.

By implementing these routine maintenance tips, you will keep your New Balance 990s in excellent condition. This proactive approach saves you time and effort in the long run. It also ensures your beloved sneakers always look their best.

## When to Seek Professional Shoe Cleaning for Your 990s

While most light and moderate cleaning can be done at home, there are times when professional help is best. Knowing when to hand over your New Balance 990s to an expert can save them from irreparable damage. I often tell people that some stains or conditions simply need a pro. It is an investment in your valuable sneakers.

**1. Deep-Seated Stains:**
If you have tried cleaning a tough stain at home and it is still visible, a professional might be able to help. Professionals have access to stronger, specialized cleaning agents. They also have tools that are not available to the average consumer. This includes dry cleaning methods for suede that are not safe for home use. They can often remove old oil stains, ink marks, or deep-set dirt that home methods cannot touch.

**2. Mold or Mildew Growth:**
If your 990s develop mold or mildew due to improper storage or prolonged dampness, professional cleaning is highly recommended. Mold spores can be difficult to remove completely. They can also pose health risks. Shoe cleaning experts have methods to kill spores and remove the unsightly growth without damaging the shoe.

**3. Color Restoration or Dye Transfer:**
Sometimes, a pair of 990s might experience color fading, especially on suede. Or, color might transfer from one part of the shoe to another. Professionals can sometimes restore color or correct dye transfer issues. This is a very delicate process that requires specialized knowledge and products. Attempting this at home could worsen the problem.

**4. Extensive Damage or Odor:**
If your shoes have extensive dirt buildup that feels overwhelming, or a persistent, strong odor that home remedies cannot eliminate, a professional can provide a deep refresh. They have industrial-grade deodorizers and cleaning systems that penetrate deep into materials. This eliminates odors at the source.

**5. Delicate or Rare Models:**
If you own a limited edition or particularly valuable pair of New Balance 990s, the risk of damaging them during home cleaning might be too high. For these precious pairs, entrusting them to a professional provides peace of mind. They have the expertise to handle them with the utmost care.

**6. Before Resale or Special Events:**
If you plan to resell your 990s or want them to look absolutely perfect for a special event, professional cleaning ensures they are in their best possible condition. A professional finish can significantly boost their appearance.

A professional shoe cleaner knows the nuances of different materials. They can apply the right techniques for your specific 990 model. While it costs money, it can extend the life and beauty of your cherished New Balance 990s.

## FAQ Section

### Q1: Can I put my New Balance 990s in the washing machine?
No, you should not put your New Balance 990s in the washing machine. The washing machine's agitation and heat can damage the shoe's delicate materials. It can cause shrinkage, color fading, or separation of the sole and upper. Always hand wash your 990s to protect their structure and appearance.

### Q2: What is the best way to clean suede on my 990s?
The best way to clean suede on your 990s is to start with dry brushing. Use a soft-bristle brush or a dedicated suede brush to gently remove loose dirt.

### Q4: Can I use regular soap to clean my 990s?

### Q5: How often should I clean my New Balance 990s?
The frequency of cleaning depends on how often you wear your 990s and the conditions they are exposed to. For everyday wear, a light wipe-down after each use is good.

### Q6: What should I do if my New Balance 990s have an odor?
If your New Balance 990s have an odor, first remove and wash the insoles. You can sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes and let it sit overnight to absorb odors. For persistent odors, consider using shoe deodorizers or charcoal inserts. Ensure shoes are completely dry after wear and cleaning to prevent odor-causing bacteria.
