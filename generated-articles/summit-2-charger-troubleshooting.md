## No Power? Initial Summit 2 Charger Checks

When your Summit 2 charger shows no signs of life, the first step is often the simplest. You must confirm it has power. This basic check helps rule out many common issues. I always start here before moving to more complex diagnostics. It saves time and frustration.

First, check the wall outlet. Plug another appliance into the same outlet. This confirms the outlet works. Sometimes, a tripped circuit breaker is the culprit. Locate your home's breaker box. Look for any switch that is in the "off" or middle position. Reset it by turning it completely off, then back on. This restores power to the outlet.

Next, inspect the charger's connection to the wall.
