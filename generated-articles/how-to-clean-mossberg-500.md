*   **Bore Brushes:** These are specific to your shotgun's gauge (e.g., 12 gauge for Mossberg 500). They scrub the inside of the barrel.
*   **Patches:** Small cotton squares used with the cleaning rod to wipe out residue and apply oil.
*   **Cleaning Cloths/Rags:** Lint-free cloths are good for wiping down external surfaces. Old t-shirts work well too.
*   **Nylon Utility Brushes:** These are great for scrubbing hard-to-reach areas of the receiver and bolt.
*   **Cotton Swabs (Q-tips):** Perfect for small crevices and detailed cleaning.
*   **Gloves:** Disposable gloves protect your hands from solvents and oils.
*   **Work Surface Protection:** A mat or old newspaper protects your table from chemicals and grime.

Having all these items ready before you start saves time. It also ensures you can complete the entire cleaning process without interruption. A well-stocked cleaning kit is a firearm owner's best friend. Just as you would prepare for any complete cleaning job, like [how to clean everything](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-everything) in your home, gathering your specific firearm cleaning supplies is step one.

### Safety First: Preparing to Clean Your Shotgun

Safety is the absolute priority before you begin cleaning your Mossberg 500. Treat every firearm as if it is loaded, even if you believe it is empty. Following these safety steps protects you and anyone nearby. Never skip these checks.

First, point the shotgun in a safe direction. Always choose a direction where an accidental discharge would cause no harm. Then, remove the magazine tube cap or spring retention pin. This allows you to remove any shells from the magazine. Pump the action several times to ensure all shells are ejected.

Next, open the action and visually inspect the chamber. Look inside to confirm there is no shell present. Feel inside with your finger to double-check. A clear chamber means no round is ready to fire. This step is critical for safe handling.

Clear your work area. Make sure no live ammunition is present on your cleaning bench. Accidental mixing of live rounds with your cleaning parts can lead to serious errors. Choose a well-lit and ventilated space. Solvents can have strong fumes. A clean, organized space helps you work safely and effectively. Keep children and pets away from your cleaning area. Safety comes before anything else.

### Disassembly: Field Stripping Your Mossberg 500

Disassembling your Mossberg 500 is a straightforward process called field stripping. You do not need special tools for this initial breakdown. This allows you to access the main components for cleaning. Follow these steps carefully to take your shotgun apart.

Start by ensuring your Mossberg 500 is unloaded and safe. Point the shotgun in a safe direction. Unscrew the magazine tube cap at the end of the barrel. This cap usually comes off by hand. Set it aside with other small parts.

Next, pull the barrel forward and away from the receiver. The barrel will slide off the magazine tube. It detaches easily once the cap is removed. Place the barrel aside, standing it upright if possible.

Now, focus on the fore-end and slide assembly. The Mossberg 500 uses twin action bars. Slide the fore-end forward until it separates from the receiver. The bolt assembly will come out with the fore-end. Carefully separate the bolt from the action bars. Note how these parts fit together for reassembly.

Finally, you can remove the trigger group. Push out the trigger group retaining pin. This pin is located near the rear of the trigger guard. Use a punch or a sturdy object like a pen if needed. Once the pin is out, the entire trigger assembly lifts free from the receiver. These are the main parts you will clean. Remember the order for reassembly.

### Cleaning Each Component

Once your Mossberg 500 is field stripped, you can start cleaning each part. Each component requires specific attention to remove all residue. This detailed cleaning ensures your shotgun works perfectly. Take your time with each section.

**1. The Barrel:**
The barrel is where most of the fouling collects. Use your cleaning rod with a bore brush. Push the brush through the barrel from the chamber end to the muzzle. Do not pull the brush back through the barrel. Pull it completely out, then push it through again. Do this several times. This motion pushes residue out rather than pulling it back into the chamber.

Next, attach a patch holder to your cleaning rod. Soak a patch in gun cleaning solvent. Push it through the barrel from chamber to muzzle. Use fresh patches until they come out clean. Finish by running a dry patch through. This removes any leftover solvent.

**2. The Receiver:**
The receiver is the main body of the shotgun. Carbon and grit build up here. Use a nylon utility brush with solvent to scrub the inside of the receiver. Pay attention to the action bar grooves and any tight spots.

Use cotton swabs for hard-to-reach areas. Wipe away loosened grime with a clean rag. Ensure no solvent pools in the receiver. A clean receiver allows the bolt and action bars to move freely.

**3. The Bolt and Bolt Carrier Assembly:**
The bolt handles cartridge loading and ejection. It gets very dirty. Use your nylon brush and solvent on all surfaces of the bolt and bolt carrier. Clean the extractor and ejector ports thoroughly. These parts manage the spent casings.

Use cotton swabs for small channels and pinholes. Ensure no carbon remains on the bolt face. Wipe everything dry with a clean cloth. Proper cleaning here prevents feeding and extraction issues.

**4. The Trigger Group:**
The trigger group is a sensitive component. It is best not to disassemble it further than removing it from the receiver. Use compressed air to blow out loose debris. Then, use a nylon brush with a small amount of solvent on external surfaces.

Avoid getting too much solvent inside the delicate firing mechanism. Wipe it down with a clean, dry cloth. If it is heavily soiled, a professional gunsmith might be needed for deeper cleaning. For regular maintenance, this is enough.

**5. The Magazine Tube:**
The magazine tube can collect dirt and rust. Use a cleaning rod with a shotgun bore brush or a large cotton patch. Push it through the tube to clean the inside. Wipe the outside with a solvent-dampened cloth. Ensure the spring moves freely inside. A clean magazine tube allows shells to feed smoothly.

### Lubrication and Protection

After cleaning all components of your Mossberg 500, proper lubrication is crucial. Lubrication reduces friction between moving parts. It also adds a protective layer against rust. Do not over-lubricate; a thin coat is usually enough.

Apply a thin layer of gun oil to the outside of the barrel. This prevents rust from forming on the steel. Use a clean, dry cloth to spread the oil evenly. Ensure you do not leave any excess oil.

Next, apply a small drop of oil to the action bars. Spread it thinly along their length. These bars need to slide smoothly for reliable operation. Put a tiny amount of oil on the bolt assembly. Focus on areas where metal rubs against metal, such as the bolt rails and cam pin.

The magazine tube also benefits from light lubrication. Apply a very thin film of oil to the outside of the tube. This helps the fore-end glide smoothly during cycling. Be careful not to get too much oil inside the tube. Excess oil can attract dirt and cause shells to stick.

Finally, put a tiny drop of oil on the trigger group pins. This helps the internal parts move freely. Wipe off any excess oil from all parts. Your Mossberg 500 is now clean, lubricated, and protected. This step extends the life of your shotgun significantly. It ensures every part works in harmony.

### Reassembly and Final Checks

You have cleaned and lubricated all parts of your Mossberg 500. Now, it is time to put it back together. Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly. Take your time and ensure each part fits correctly. A properly reassembled shotgun is safe and reliable.

First, reinstall the trigger group into the receiver. Align it carefully. Push the trigger group retaining pin back into place. It should slide in easily. If it does not, check the alignment of the trigger group. Do not force the pin.

Next, attach the bolt assembly to the action bars. Slide the fore-end and action bar assembly onto the magazine tube. Push it back into the receiver. The bolt should align with its tracks in the receiver. Ensure it moves smoothly.

Now, slide the barrel onto the magazine tube. Align the barrel extension with the receiver. Push the barrel fully back until it seats properly. The barrel lug will align with the receiver. Screw the magazine tube cap back onto the end of the magazine tube. Tighten it by hand until it is snug.

Finally, perform a function check. Point the shotgun in a safe direction. Work the action several times. It should cycle smoothly. Pull the trigger (on an empty chamber). You should hear the hammer fall. Then, work the action again. Hold the trigger back while cycling the action, then release it slowly. You should hear a distinct "click" as the trigger resets. This confirms the trigger group is functioning correctly. Your Mossberg 500 is now clean, lubricated, and ready for safe storage or use.
