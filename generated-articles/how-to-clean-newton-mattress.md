As a parent, I understand the constant worry about your child's sleep environment. Maintaining a clean and hygienic sleep space is crucial for their health and well-being. This is especially true for your child's mattress. Learning how to clean a Newton mattress effectively is key to ensuring a healthy, safe space for your little one.

Newton mattresses stand out with their unique washable design. This guide will walk you through every step. We will cover routine cleaning, how to handle common spills, removing odors, and deep cleaning the innovative core. You will also learn how to prevent issues like mold. By the end, you will feel confident keeping your Newton mattress fresh and clean for years to come.

### Takeaway

*   **Dry all components fully** before reassembly to prevent mold.
*   **Maintain good air circulation** around the mattress.

### How do you clean a Newton mattress?

Cleaning a Newton mattress involves two main parts: washing the removable cover and rinsing the unique breathable core. The cover goes into your washing machine. The core can be rinsed in a shower or tub with cool water and mild soap. Both parts must dry completely before you put them back together.

## Understanding Your Newton Mattress's Unique Design

Newton mattresses are different from traditional foam or spring mattresses. Their design focuses on breathability and washability. This makes them a top choice for parents. Understanding how the mattress is built helps you clean it properly. I believe knowing your mattress's parts makes cleaning easier.

Newton mattresses feature a two-part system. First, there is a soft, quilted cover. Second, there is the Wovenaire® core. This core is made of a food-grade polymer. It is 90% air and 10% material. This structure allows air to flow freely. This means your baby can breathe right through it. It also prevents heat buildup. This unique core is fully washable. This is a big advantage over other mattress types.

### The Washable Cover

The Newton mattress cover zips off easily. It is soft and comfortable for your baby. This cover protects the Wovenaire® core. It also adds a layer of cushioning. The cover is typically made of breathable materials. These materials are gentle on your baby's skin. You can machine wash this cover. Always check the care tag for specific washing instructions.

Washing the cover regularly removes dust, dirt, and allergens. It keeps the sleep surface fresh. I recommend washing it often. This is especially true if your baby has allergies or skin sensitivities. A clean cover helps maintain a healthy sleep environment.

### The Breathable Core

The Wovenaire® core is the most special part. It looks like a tangle of white noodles. This structure creates a lot of open space. This open space allows for maximum airflow. It also prevents the growth of bacteria and dust mites. The core does not trap moisture. This helps keep it dry and hygienic.

You can fully submerge this core in water. This allows for a thorough clean. You can rinse away any dirt, dust, or spills. This deep cleaning ability sets Newton apart. It provides peace of mind for parents. Knowing you can wash the whole mattress makes a big difference.

## Routine Cleaning for a Fresh Newton Mattress

Regular cleaning keeps your Newton mattress in top shape. It also ensures a healthy sleep space for your child. A consistent cleaning routine prevents dirt and odors from building up. I find that small, regular efforts save a lot of work later. This approach also extends the life of your mattress.

Maintaining the mattress regularly involves simple steps. You will focus on the removable cover for daily or weekly tasks. The core requires less frequent deep cleaning. By following these routine steps, you ensure your baby sleeps on a clean surface. This helps prevent many common issues.

### Daily Spot Checks

Take a quick look at the mattress each day. Check for any new spills or accidents. Address these spills immediately. Fresh spills are much easier to clean than old, set-in stains. A quick wipe can prevent a bigger problem.

Use a clean cloth dampened with water for minor spots. Gently blot the area. Do not rub hard. Rubbing can spread the stain. For stickier messes, a mild, non-toxic cleaner can help. Always make sure the area is dry before putting the sheets back on.

### Weekly Cover Washing

Your Newton mattress cover collects dust, sweat, and other debris. Washing it weekly or bi-weekly keeps it fresh. First, unzip the cover and remove it from the core. Place the cover in your washing machine. Use cold water and a mild, bleach-free detergent.

Wash the cover on a delicate or gentle cycle. After washing, tumble dry on low heat. You can also air dry it. Make sure the cover is completely dry before zipping it back onto the core. A damp cover can encourage mold growth.

## Tackling Common Spills and Stains on Your Newton Mattress

Accidents happen, especially with babies. Urine, vomit, and food spills are common on a baby's mattress. Knowing how to clean these stains quickly is important. Prompt action prevents stains from setting. It also helps prevent odors from lingering. I always recommend having cleaning supplies ready.

Different types of stains need slightly different approaches. The key is to act fast and use gentle methods. Harsh chemicals can damage the mattress materials. They can also leave harmful residues. Focus on safe, effective cleaning solutions.

### Urine Stains

Urine stains are common with infants. When you notice a wet spot, remove the cover right away. Rinse the affected area of the core under cool water. For the cover, wash it following the instructions. For set-in urine stains on the core, you might need a deeper clean. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Gently blot the area on the core. Then rinse thoroughly.

For detailed guidance on treating urine, refer to this article: [how to clean pee off a mattress](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pee-off-a-mattress). It provides more specific steps for removing pee stains effectively.

### Vomit and Other Organic Stains

Vomit and other organic stains can be messy. First, remove any solid matter using a dull knife or spoon. Be careful not to spread the mess. Then, remove the cover and wash it immediately. For the core, rinse the affected area thoroughly with cool water. You can use a mild soap if needed.

A solution of baking soda and water can help with organic stains and odors. Apply a paste, let it sit, then rinse. For more specific instructions on dealing with vomit, you can read this guide: [how to clean vomit from mattress](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-vomit-from-mattress). This resource offers valuable tips for effective vomit removal.

### General Stains

For other general spills or marks, speed is your friend. Blot the spill with a clean cloth. Do not rub, as this can push the stain deeper. For persistent marks, a mixture of mild soap and water can work. Dampen a cloth with the solution. Gently dab the stained area. Rinse the area with a cloth dampened with plain water.

Ensuring the area dries completely is essential. You can use a fan to speed up drying.

This article provides a comprehensive approach to various mattress stains.

## Eliminating Odors from Your Newton Mattress

Odors can build up in any mattress, even a Newton. Spills, sweat, and general use contribute to smells. Getting rid of odors is important for a fresh sleeping environment. I have found that natural deodorizers work best. They are safe for your baby and the mattress.

The unique structure of the Newton mattress helps with air circulation. This prevents odors from trapping. However, sometimes a deeper deodorizing step is needed. This is especially true after a major spill. Regular deodorizing keeps the mattress smelling clean and inviting.

### Baking Soda Power

Baking soda is a natural odor absorber. It is safe for use on baby products. For mild odors, sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda over the entire mattress core. Let it sit for several hours, or even overnight. The baking soda will absorb unpleasant smells.

After the baking soda has worked, vacuum it up thoroughly from the core. For the cover, you can add baking soda directly to the wash cycle. This boosts its cleaning and deodorizing power. For more tips on using baking soda for stains and odors, check out this guide: [how to clean stains off mattress with baking soda](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stains-off-mattress-with-baking-soda).

### Airing it Out

Fresh air is a powerful deodorizer. After cleaning the cover or core, let them air out. If possible, place the core in a well-ventilated area. Sunlight also helps sanitize and remove odors. Do not leave it in direct, strong sunlight for too long. This can cause material breakdown.

Open windows in the room where the mattress sits. Allow air to circulate. This helps dry the mattress and removes any lingering smells. Good airflow is key to preventing future odor issues. It also helps prevent moisture buildup.

## Deep Cleaning the Newton Mattress Core

The Newton mattress core's washable design is a game-changer. This means you can truly deep clean it. This is important for maintaining hygiene. I recommend deep cleaning the core every few months. Do this more often if your baby has frequent accidents or allergies.

Deep cleaning removes unseen dirt, allergens, and bacteria. It refreshes the core. This process is straightforward. It just requires proper drying. Do not rush the drying process. A damp core can lead to problems like mold.

### Preparing the Core for Washing

First, remove the zippered cover from the Wovenaire® core. Place the cover aside to wash separately. Carry the bare core to a large tub or a shower. You will need enough space to maneuver it. A clean, empty tub works well.

Make sure the tub or shower is clean. You want to avoid transferring dirt. You can lay a clean towel down in the tub. This protects the core from any harsh surfaces. Have a mild, non-toxic soap ready. A gentle dish soap or baby soap works fine.

### Washing the Core

Turn on cool or lukewarm water. Use a showerhead or a pitcher to wet the entire core. Squeeze a small amount of mild soap directly onto the core. Gently massage the soap into the material. Work it into all areas. You can use your hands or a soft brush.

Rinse the core thoroughly under running water. Keep rinsing until no more soap suds appear. Make sure all soap residue is gone. You can press down on the core to help release water and soap. Repeat the washing and rinsing process if the core is very dirty.

### Drying the Core Properly

Drying the core completely is the most crucial step. A damp core can become a breeding ground for mold. After rinsing, stand the core on its side in the tub or shower. Let excess water drip off. Press it gently to squeeze out more water.

Then, move the core to a well-ventilated area. You can stand it on its side against a wall. Place towels underneath to catch drips. Use a fan or dehumidifier to speed up drying. Rotate the core every few hours to expose all sides to air. Drying can take 24-48 hours. Ensure it is completely dry before putting the cover back on.

## Addressing Mold and Mildew on Your Newton Mattress

Mold and mildew can grow in damp environments. While Newton mattresses are designed to be breathable, improper drying can still lead to issues. Mold poses health risks, especially for babies. Prevention is always better than cure. I pay close attention to drying all parts fully.

If you suspect mold, act quickly. Mold can spread fast. Identifying and treating it promptly keeps your baby safe. Always ensure proper ventilation. This is key to mold prevention.

### Mold Prevention

The best way to deal with mold is to prevent it. Always ensure the mattress cover and core are 100% dry before reassembly. This is crucial after washing. Use fans or dehumidifiers. Allow plenty of airflow in your baby's room. Avoid placing the mattress directly on a cold, damp floor.

Consider using a waterproof mattress protector. This adds an extra layer of defense against spills. This helps keep the core dry. Regularly check the mattress area for any signs of dampness. Address any leaks or high humidity in the room quickly.

### Removing Mold

If you find mold on your Newton mattress core, do not panic. Small spots of mold can often be removed. Take the core outside or to a well-ventilated area. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Use a spray bottle to apply this solution to the moldy spots. Let it sit for about an hour.

Then, scrub the mold gently with a soft brush. Rinse the affected area thoroughly with cool water. Make sure all mold and cleaning solution are gone. Dry the core completely using fans. For more severe mold issues, or if mold is extensive, it may be best to contact Newton customer service.

## Maintaining Your Newton Mattress for Longevity

Proper maintenance extends the life of your Newton mattress. It keeps it fresh and effective. Regular care saves you money in the long run. It also ensures a consistent healthy sleep surface for your child. I consider maintenance a part of everyday parenting.

Beyond routine cleaning, a few simple habits help. These habits protect the mattress from wear and tear. They also ensure it continues to provide its unique benefits. Your Newton mattress is an investment. Good care protects that investment.

### Use a Waterproof Mattress Protector

Even though the Newton mattress is washable, a waterproof protector adds an important layer. It catches spills before they reach the core. This reduces the frequency of full core washes. Choose a protector that is also breathable. This maintains the mattress's airflow properties.

A good protector makes cleanup much easier. It protects against unexpected accidents. This means less stress for you. It also helps keep the inner core cleaner for longer periods.

### Rotate the Mattress Regularly

While not strictly necessary for Newton mattresses due to their consistent support, rotating can sometimes help. You can rotate the core 180 degrees every few months. This ensures even wear, though this is less of a concern with Newton's design. It helps maintain its shape over time.

This practice is more common with traditional mattresses. However, it can be a good habit. It distributes pressure evenly. This small step contributes to overall mattress health.

### Store Properly When Not in Use

If you need to store your Newton mattress, do it carefully. Ensure both the cover and core are completely dry. Store the mattress in a cool, dry place. Avoid basements or attics, which can be damp. Use a breathable mattress bag or wrapping.

Do not store it in plastic bags that trap moisture. This can lead to mold and mildew. Proper storage protects the mattress from dust, dirt, and humidity. This keeps it ready for future use.

## FAQ Section
