## Effective Methods for Stuck-On Food on Nordic Ware

Sometimes, food sticks more than usual. This is often due to sugary drippings or burnt bits. Do not despair. Gentle methods can remove these stubborn messes. Patience is your best friend here. These techniques save your baking sheet from damage.

### The Warm Water Soak Method

Soaking is the first step for stuck-on food. It softens the debris. This makes it easier to remove. I often use this method after baking something messy. It works wonders.

Fill your sink or a large basin with hot water. Add a generous squirt of dish soap. Place your Nordic Ware baking sheet into the water. Make sure the stuck-on areas are fully submerged. Let the sheet soak for at least 30 minutes. For very stubborn bits, let it soak for a few hours or even overnight. The hot water and soap work together. They loosen the baked-on grime. After soaking, gently scrape off softened residue. Use a silicone or plastic scraper. Then, proceed with your regular washing steps.

### Baking Soda Paste for Gentle Scrubbing

Baking soda is a natural cleaner. It is mildly abrasive. This makes it perfect for gentle scrubbing. It helps lift grime without scratching. It is also safe for most bakeware surfaces.

To make a paste, mix baking soda with a little water. You want a thick consistency. It should be like toothpaste. Spread this paste over the stuck-on food or stained areas. Let the paste sit for 15-20 minutes. This allows the baking soda to work. Then, gently scrub the area with a soft sponge or cloth. You can also make a powerful cleaning solution with [vinegar and baking soda](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-with-vinegar-and-baking-soda). The mild abrasive action lifts the grime away.
