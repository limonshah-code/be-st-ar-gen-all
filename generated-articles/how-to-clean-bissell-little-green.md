## Keep Your Bissell Little Green Spotless

Your Bissell Little Green machine is a true helper for spills and stains. It works hard to keep your home looking clean. To make sure it always performs its best, you must know **how to clean Bissell Little Green** properly. A well-maintained cleaner performs better and lasts longer. Neglecting cleaning can lead to bad odors and reduced suction power.

This guide helps you understand each step of cleaning your Bissell Little Green. We will cover routine care and deeper cleaning tasks. You will learn about emptying tanks, rinsing components, and addressing specific areas like the hose and nozzle. Follow these steps to keep your machine in top condition. This ensures your Bissell Little Green is always ready for the next mess.

### Takeaway: Maintain Your Bissell Little Green for Peak Performance

*   Empty and rinse dirty water and solution tanks after every use to prevent odor and mildew.
*   Flush the hose and clean the nozzle thoroughly to clear debris and solution residue.
*   Regularly check and clean the filter, brushes, and exterior to ensure efficient operation.
*   Store the machine dry and disassembled partially to allow air circulation and prevent moisture buildup.

The Bissell Little Green cleaner requires regular cleaning after each use to prevent residue buildup and unpleasant odors. Start by emptying and rinsing both the dirty water and clean solution tanks. Then, flush the hose, clean the nozzle, and wipe down the exterior surfaces. This simple routine keeps your machine ready for immediate use.

## Essential Daily Care for Your Little Green Cleaner

Maintaining your Bissell Little Green machine starts with daily care. After each use, perform a few simple steps. These steps prevent dirt buildup and odors. They also ensure your machine runs smoothly every time you need it.

My Bissell Little Green saves me often from spills. I make sure to clean it right after I finish a job. This simple habit makes a big difference in its performance. It keeps the machine ready for the next unexpected mess.

### Emptying and Rinsing the Dirty Water Tank

The dirty water tank holds all the grime your Bissell Little Green picks up. This tank must be emptied immediately after cleaning. Do not let dirty water sit inside. Stagnant water can grow mold and cause bad smells.

To empty the tank, detach it from the machine. Carry it to a sink or toilet. Pour out all the dirty water. Rinse the tank thoroughly with clean, warm water. Swish the water around to remove any residue. I often fill it halfway, shake it, and then dump it again. This ensures no sticky film remains inside. Let the tank air dry completely before reattaching it.

### Rinsing the Clean Solution Tank

Even the clean solution tank needs attention. Some cleaning solutions can leave residue. This residue might affect future cleaning performance. It can also cause a stale smell over time.

Empty any leftover clean solution. Rinse the tank with warm, clean water. Do not use soap here, as it can foam excessively later. Just plain water is enough. Allow the tank to air dry. Make sure the cap is open to allow proper air circulation. This keeps your clean tank truly clean.

## Deep Cleaning the Hose and Nozzle

The hose and nozzle are critical components of your Bissell Little Green. They directly contact dirt and cleaning solution. Over time, debris and sticky residue can accumulate inside them. This accumulation can reduce suction and spread old dirt back onto your carpets.

I have found that a clogged hose makes the cleaner less effective. Taking the time to properly clean these parts prevents many future headaches. It also helps your machine deliver powerful cleaning with every use.

### Flushing the Hose for Clear Passages

To flush the hose, detach the nozzle. Hold the hose over a sink or bucket. Pour clean, warm water directly into the hose opening. You can use a small funnel if needed. Allow the water to run through until it comes out clear. This pushes out any trapped dirt or solution.

For a more thorough flush, some Bissell models include a "Hose Rinse" tool. Attach this tool to your machine. Run clean water through it as per your model's instructions. This mimics actual cleaning but with only water. It cleans the internal parts of the hose effectively. Doing this regularly keeps the hose clear and free of blockages.

### Cleaning the Nozzle and Brushes

The nozzle is where the cleaning action happens. It often collects hair, fibers, and dirt. After each use, detach the nozzle from the hose. Inspect the underside for any stuck debris. Use a small brush or even an old toothbrush to scrub away grime. Pay attention to the spray jets and suction path.

The nozzle often has small bristles or a brush bar. Clean these bristles gently. Remove any tangled hair. A pair of scissors can help cut through stubborn hair. Rinse the nozzle under running water. Ensure all parts are clean and clear. Let it air dry completely before storing. Proper nozzle care ensures consistent spray and strong suction.

## Maintaining the Filter and Other Components

Beyond tanks and hoses, other parts of your Bissell Little Green also need attention. The filter protects the motor from debris. Brushes get tangled with hair. Regular checks of these components ensure optimal performance. Ignoring them can lead to motor issues or reduced cleaning effectiveness.

I always check these hidden parts because they play a big role. It is easy to forget them. However, they are essential for keeping the machine running correctly. A few extra minutes of maintenance here save repair costs later.

### Cleaning or Replacing the Filter

Many Bissell Little Green models have a filter. This filter traps small particles. Check your user manual to locate your specific model's filter. Typically, it is near the motor or suction path. Remove the filter carefully.

If your filter is washable, rinse it under running water. Make sure no dirt remains trapped in the filter material. Let it air dry completely before placing it back. A damp filter can cause mildew or damage the motor. If the filter is not washable or looks worn, replace it. A clean filter ensures strong suction and protects the machine's internal parts.

### Checking and Cleaning Brushes/Attachments

Your Bissell Little Green comes with various attachments. The primary brush on the nozzle or separate tools collect a lot of hair and fiber. After cleaning, remove any tangled hair from the brushes. You can use scissors to cut through stubborn tangles. Use a damp cloth to wipe down the plastic parts of the attachments.

Ensure all attachments are clean and dry before storage. This prevents the transfer of old dirt to new surfaces. Clean attachments also perform better. For instance, if you are [cleaning a couch with your Bissell Little Green](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-couch-with-bissell-little-green), clean attachments ensure a fresh start on your upholstery.

### Wiping Down the Exterior

The outside of your Bissell Little Green can get dusty or dirty during use. Use a soft, damp cloth to wipe down the entire exterior. Pay attention to crevices where dirt might collect. This simple step keeps your machine looking good. It also prevents the spread of dirt from the machine to your clean surfaces.

## Addressing Odors and Stubborn Buildup

Sometimes, despite regular cleaning, unpleasant odors can develop in your Bissell Little Green. This usually happens from lingering residue or mold growth. Stubborn buildup can also occur in less accessible areas. Addressing these issues ensures your machine always smells fresh and cleans effectively.

I faced a persistent musty smell once. It took extra effort, but I learned how to eliminate it. Preventing these issues is easier than treating them. However, if they arise, specific steps can help.

### Deodorizing Your Bissell Little Green

To deodorize your machine, you can run a "clean water" cycle. Fill the clean tank with plain, warm water. You can add a capful of white vinegar. Vinegar is a natural deodorizer. Do not use harsh chemicals. Run the machine for a few minutes. Spray the solution through the hose and nozzle. Let it suction up the water into the dirty tank.

Repeat this process several times. This flushes out any remaining odor-causing residues. Afterward, thoroughly clean all components as described earlier. Ensure everything dries completely. This helps prevent future odors.

### Dealing with Stubborn Buildup and Clogs

Stubborn buildup can block the hose or nozzle. If you notice reduced suction, a clog might be present. First, disconnect the hose and nozzle. Visually inspect for any large obstructions. Sometimes, a long piece of hair or lint can cause a blockage. You can use a flexible brush, like a bottle brush, to push through the hose. Never use sharp objects that could puncture the hose.

For mineral buildup, especially if you use hard water, a vinegar solution can help. Mix equal parts white vinegar and warm water. Pour it into the clean tank. Run this solution through the machine. Let it sit in the system for a short period (about 15-20 minutes). Then, flush with clear water. This can dissolve mineral deposits. Similar methods are used for [cleaning mold with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-with-vinegar) in other household applications, showing its versatility.

### Post-Cleaning Drying Protocol

Proper drying is the most crucial step to prevent mold and odors. After cleaning all components, let them air dry completely. Do not reassemble the machine immediately. Leave tanks, nozzles, and hoses disconnected.

Place them in a well-ventilated area. You can even point a fan towards them to speed up drying. Ensure every crevice is dry. Even a small amount of moisture can lead to mildew. I usually leave my components out overnight. This ensures everything is bone dry before I put the machine back together.

## Storage Tips for Longevity

Proper storage of your Bissell Little Green extends its lifespan. Storing a wet or dirty machine causes problems. It can lead to mold, rust, and reduced performance. A little effort in storage saves future headaches and money.

I always find that taking an extra moment for proper storage pays off. My machines last longer. They are also ready to go when I need them. It is a small habit that yields big benefits.

### Ensuring Complete Dryness Before Storage

As mentioned, complete dryness is key. Before putting your Bissell Little Green away, verify that all tanks, hoses, nozzles, and brushes are completely dry. Feel every surface. Check inside the tanks and along the hose. Any lingering moisture encourages mold and mildew growth. This mold can then contaminate your cleaning solutions and surfaces.

You can use a dry cloth to wipe down parts after rinsing. Then, leave them disassembled to air dry for several hours. A warm, dry environment helps accelerate this process. Never store the unit in a damp basement or closet if components are still wet. This step alone prevents most odor issues.

### Proper Storage Location and Position

Store your Bissell Little Green in a clean, dry area. A utility closet or garage is fine, provided it is not prone to dampness. Avoid extreme temperatures. Freezing temperatures can damage internal components or crack plastic. High heat can warp plastic parts.

Store the machine in its upright position. Ensure all parts are securely attached or stored alongside. Do not store the machine with water or solution in the tanks. Empty and clean them every time. Storing the machine properly helps maintain its shape and function.

### Periodic Deep Cleaning Schedule

Even with daily care, a periodic deep clean is beneficial. Once every few months, consider a more thorough cleaning. This involves checking areas you might usually overlook. This could include checking seals or inspecting internal connections for wear.

A deep cleaning schedule helps catch small issues before they become big problems. It also ensures all hidden corners are free of grime. This makes sure your Bissell Little Green remains a powerful and effective cleaning tool for years to come.

## Common Cleaning Challenges and Solutions

Even with the best intentions, cleaning your Bissell Little Green can present challenges. Odors, reduced suction, and mysterious leaks are common. Understanding how to tackle these issues ensures your machine remains reliable. Do not let small problems derail your cleaning efforts.

I have faced some of these problems myself. Finding solutions made me a better cleaner. It also taught me more about how my machine works. Here are some common challenges and their fixes.

### Dealing with Persistent Odors

Persistent odors often come from mold or mildew. These grow in damp, dirty environments. If regular cleaning and air drying do not help, try a diluted bleach solution (check your manual first, as not all plastics are compatible). Mix one teaspoon of bleach with one gallon of water. Run this solution through the clean water tank. Spray it through the hose and nozzle. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then, thoroughly flush with plain water.

Alternatively, use an enzymatic cleaner designed for pet odors. These cleaners break down odor-causing molecules. Follow the product instructions carefully. Ensure all components are completely dry after treatment. Air circulation is your best friend against odors.

### Troubleshooting Reduced Suction

Reduced suction usually means a clog. It can also indicate a problem with a seal or a full dirty water tank. First, check the dirty water tank. If it is full, empty it. Next, inspect the hose and nozzle for clogs. Clear any blockages.

If the problem persists, check the seals on the tanks. Ensure they are seated correctly. A loose seal allows air to escape. This reduces suction. Some models have a small filter that can get clogged. Clean or replace this filter. Make sure the nozzle is flush against the surface you are cleaning. An improper angle can reduce suction.

### Preventing Mold and Mildew Growth

Prevention is always better than cure for mold and mildew. The key is complete dryness. After every use, clean and dry all parts. Never store the machine wet. Use a fan to aid drying if needed. Store components separately until dry.

You can also use an antimicrobial rinse occasionally. Some cleaning solutions contain antimicrobial agents. Or, you can add a tiny amount of mold inhibitor (like a small amount of tea tree oil solution, if safe for your machine). Always check your user manual for approved additives. Proper ventilation in your storage area also helps.

## Extending the Life of Your Bissell Little Green

Your Bissell Little Green is an investment. Proper care extends its functional life significantly. Regular cleaning and mindful use prevent premature wear. Thinking about how you use and store the machine impacts its longevity.

I always treat my tools with care. My Bissell Little Green has lasted years because of consistent maintenance. These final tips help ensure your cleaner keeps serving you for a long time.

### Using the Right Cleaning Solutions

Always use Bissell-approved cleaning solutions. Other solutions might contain harsh chemicals. These chemicals can damage the internal components. They can also leave excessive residue. Using the correct solution prevents clogs and buildup. It also ensures the best cleaning performance.

Never use foaming agents not designed for carpet cleaners. Excessive foam can damage the motor or clog the suction path. Check your machine's manual for recommended solutions. Stick to those.

### Protecting Internal Components

Beyond cleaning, protect the internal workings. Avoid picking up very large debris or sharp objects. These can damage the pump or clog the hose. Always vacuum the area first. This removes loose dirt and protects your Bissell Little Green.

Do not overfill the clean water tank. This can lead to leaks or put strain on the pump. Store the machine away from extreme heat or cold. These conditions can degrade plastic and rubber parts over time. Treating the machine with care during use and storage guards its delicate internal parts.

### When to Consider Professional Servicing

Most Bissell Little Green issues are fixable at home. However, some problems might need professional help. If you experience a complete loss of power, unusual noises from the motor, or persistent leaks you cannot fix, consider servicing.

Check your warranty first. Bissell offers support for their products. Sometimes, a part might need replacement that is not user-serviceable. A professional can diagnose and repair complex issues. This saves you from buying a new machine unnecessarily. Proper [appliance maintenance](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-proheat-pet-turbo) can extend life, but knowing when to seek professional help is also wise.
