## How Long Does a Well Pump Last on Average?

Many homeowners ask, "How long does a well pump last?" On average, a well pump provides reliable service for 10 to 15 years. Some pumps may fail earlier. Others may surprise you by lasting longer, even up to 20 years or more. This range exists because many things affect a pump's lifespan. The type of pump plays a big role in its expected durability. How often you use the pump also matters greatly.

Well pumps work hard to supply water. They face constant stress from moving water. They also deal with electrical demands. Understanding this average helps homeowners plan. It allows them to budget for a potential replacement. It also encourages them to perform routine checks. We will look at what makes some pumps last longer than others.

## Types of Well Pumps and Their Durability

Not all well pumps are the same. Different types exist to meet various well depths and water needs. Each type has its own average lifespan. Knowing your pump type helps set proper expectations for its durability.

### Submersible Well Pumps

Submersible pumps are common for deep wells. They sit inside the well, submerged in water. This design helps keep them cool. It also makes them quiet during operation. Submersible pumps generally have a longer lifespan. They often last 15 years or more. Some units can operate for over 25 years. Their submersion helps protect them from the elements.

However, replacing a submersible pump costs more. It needs special equipment to pull it from the well. [Submersible well pump troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/submersible-well-pump-troubleshooting) can be more complex due to their location. Careful installation helps ensure their longevity. Good power supply also prevents early failure.

### Jet Well Pumps

Jet pumps typically sit above ground, inside your home or a pump house. They use a motor to create suction. This suction pulls water from the well. Jet pumps are suitable for shallow wells, usually less than 25 feet deep. They have a shorter average lifespan compared to submersible pumps. A typical jet pump lasts 8 to 12 years. Their above-ground location exposes them to more environmental factors.

Jet pumps are easier to access for repairs. This also makes them simpler to replace. However, they can be louder than submersible pumps. They also need more frequent maintenance checks. Ensure no leaks happen near their location. Keep the area clean and dry.

## Factors Affecting Well Pump Longevity

Several key factors determine how long your well pump lasts. Understanding these helps you take action. You can then extend the pump's service life. Ignoring these factors often leads to early pump failure.

### Water Quality and Sediment

The quality of your well water significantly impacts your pump. Water with high levels of sediment, sand, or grit acts like sandpaper. It causes wear and tear on pump components. Impurities can clog impellers. They can also damage seals and bearings. This friction shortens the pump's life. Hard water also poses a risk. Mineral buildup can coat internal parts. This reduces efficiency and causes strain.

Consider a water filtration system if your well water contains many particles. This protects your pump and other home appliances. Regular testing of your well water helps you know its quality. It allows you to address issues before they cause major pump damage.

### Pump Usage and Cycling

How often your pump turns on and off affects its lifespan. This is known as pump cycling. Each start-up creates a surge of power and mechanical stress. Frequent cycling wears out the motor and other components faster. A common cause of excessive cycling is a faulty pressure tank. A waterlogged pressure tank cannot store enough water. This causes the pump to turn on every time you open a faucet.

Ensure your pressure tank works correctly. It should maintain proper air pressure. This allows it to store water efficiently. This reduces the number of times your pump cycles. You can also conserve water to reduce overall pump usage. This lowers the workload on your well pump.

### Installation Quality

Proper installation is crucial for well pump longevity. An improperly installed pump may experience stress. This includes being too close to the well bottom. It could also mean incorrect pipe sizing. Poor wiring can lead to electrical issues. This harms the motor. If a pump is not hung correctly in the well, it can vibrate excessively. Vibration causes premature wear on components.

Always hire a qualified professional for well pump installation. They ensure the pump is sized correctly for your well and home needs. They also make sure all electrical connections are safe and proper. Correct installation sets the stage for a long and reliable pump life.

### Well Depth and Water Level

The depth of your well matters. Pumps work harder to lift water from deeper wells. This increased effort can shorten their life. Low water levels in the well are also damaging. If the water level drops below the pump's intake, the pump can run dry. Dry running causes significant heat buildup. This quickly damages the motor and seals. It often leads to immediate pump failure.

Install a low-water cutoff switch if your well water levels fluctuate. This switch turns off the pump if the water level drops too low. It protects the pump from dry running. Consider drilling a deeper well if your current well frequently runs dry. Consistent water levels are vital for pump health.

### Power Supply and Electrical Issues

A stable and correct power supply is vital for a well pump. Voltage fluctuations or low voltage can harm the motor. Surges can cause sudden damage. Constant low voltage makes the motor work harder. This causes it to overheat. Improper wiring also leads to power issues. This shortens the pump's life.

Use a surge protector for your pump if possible. Ensure your home's electrical system supports the pump's power needs. Have a qualified electrician check your well pump's wiring. This prevents electrical problems. Stable power helps the pump run smoothly and last longer.

## Signs Your Well Pump May Be Failing

Even with the best maintenance, pumps eventually fail. Knowing the signs of a failing well pump helps you act fast. Early detection can save you from a complete water outage. It might also allow for repair instead of full replacement.

### Reduced Water Pressure

One of the most common signs is a noticeable drop in water pressure. Your shower might feel weaker. Faucets might deliver less water. This can happen suddenly or gradually. A decline in pressure means the pump struggles to move water efficiently. It could be due to worn impellers or a failing motor. Sometimes, low water levels in the well can also cause this.

Before panicking, check other potential causes. A clogged water filter or a problem with your pressure tank can also reduce pressure. If these are fine, your pump might be the issue.

### Fluctuating Water Pressure

Water pressure that goes up and down is another warning sign. This means your pump is not maintaining a steady output. It might struggle to keep a consistent pressure setting. This often points to issues with the pressure switch. It can also indicate a worn-out pump motor. The pump might be short-cycling.

*   **Observe pressure gauge:** Watch the needle for erratic movements.
*   **Listen for pump cycling:** Does the pump turn on and off rapidly?

Fluctuating pressure puts extra stress on the pump. Address this issue quickly to prevent further damage.

### Air Spitting from Faucets

If air comes out of your faucets, your pump might be struggling. This can happen when the water level in your well drops too low. The pump starts pulling air along with water. It can also mean a leak in your suction line (for jet pumps). Air in the lines can damage the pump. It causes cavitation, which wears down components.

*   **Check well water level:** Ensure the water covers the pump intake.
*   **Inspect suction lines:** Look for leaks or cracks.

Ignoring air in the lines can lead to pump burnout.

### Constant Running or Short Cycling

A well pump should turn on when water pressure drops. It should turn off when pressure reaches the set point. If your pump runs constantly, it has a problem. This might be a leak in your system. It could also be a pressure switch issue. A pump that turns on and off very quickly (short cycling) is also a sign of trouble. This usually points to a waterlogged pressure tank.

*   **Listen to your pump:** Is it running more often than usual?
*   **Check pressure tank:** Tap it to see if it sounds full of water.

Both constant running and short cycling waste energy. They also put immense strain on the pump motor. This will significantly shorten its lifespan.

### No Water at All

This is the most obvious sign of a pump failure. If no water comes out of your faucets, your pump has likely stopped working. This could be due to a tripped circuit breaker. It could also be a completely failed pump motor. Sometimes, the well itself might be dry.

*   **Check circuit breaker:** Reset if tripped.
*   **Listen for pump motor:** Do you hear any sounds from the pump?
*   **Consult a professional:** They can diagnose the exact issue.

When you have no water, immediate action is necessary. A professional plumber or well technician can help diagnose the problem. They can provide solutions.
