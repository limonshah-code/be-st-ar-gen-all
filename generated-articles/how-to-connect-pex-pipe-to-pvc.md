## How To Connect PEX Pipe To PVC: Your Comprehensive Guide

Have you ever faced a plumbing project that requires joining two different types of pipes? Perhaps you are upgrading an old system or extending new lines. One common challenge DIYers and even professionals encounter is figuring out how to connect PEX pipe to PVC. It might seem complicated at first, but with the right knowledge and tools, it is a straightforward process.

PEX and PVC are both popular plumbing materials, each with unique properties. PEX, or cross-linked polyethylene, is flexible and great for water supply lines. PVC, polyvinyl chloride, is rigid and widely used for drainage, waste, and vent (DWV) systems, as well as some cold-water supply applications. Understanding how to create a secure, leak-proof connection between these two materials is essential for any successful plumbing job. This article will walk you through the necessary steps, tools, and methods to confidently connect PEX to PVC, ensuring your plumbing system works efficiently.

### Takeaway

Connecting PEX pipe to PVC requires specific adapters and proper techniques to ensure a reliable, leak-free joint.
*   **Choose the Right Fittings:** Use transition fittings like PEX-to-threaded adapters, PVC threaded adapters, or specialized push-to-connect fittings.
*   **Prepare Pipes Properly:** Cut pipes squarely and deburr edges.
*   **Understand Application:** Pressure applications (water supply) use different methods than non-pressure (drainage).
*   **Secure Connections:** Use crimping, clamping, or solvent welding as per fitting type.
*   **Test Thoroughly:** Always check for leaks before closing walls or using the system.

Connecting PEX pipe to PVC involves using specialized transition fittings. For pressure applications, this typically means a PEX adapter (crimp, clamp, or push-to-connect) joined to a threaded PVC adapter. For drain applications, mechanical couplings or rubber transition fittings are common.

## Understanding PEX and PVC: Material Insights

Before we dive into connections, let's understand the materials themselves. PEX and PVC serve different primary purposes in plumbing. Knowing their characteristics helps you choose the right connection method.

PEX (cross-linked polyethylene) pipe is a flexible plastic tubing. Plumbers widely use it for water supply lines because of its flexibility, resistance to corrosion, and ability to withstand freezing. PEX comes in coils, making it easy to snake through walls and floors. It reduces the need for many fittings, which can save time and reduce potential leak points. PEX systems rely on mechanical connections, such as crimp, clamp, or expansion fittings, rather than glues.

PVC (polyvinyl chloride) pipe is a rigid plastic pipe. It is very durable and chemical-resistant. PVC is a common choice for drain, waste, and vent (DWV) systems. You also find PVC in cold-water supply lines and irrigation systems. PVC pipes and fittings connect using a solvent cement, which chemically welds the pieces together. Different types of PVC exist, like Schedule 40 for general use and Schedule 80 for higher pressure.

Mixing these two materials requires careful consideration of their properties. PEX is flexible and connects mechanically. PVC is rigid and connects with glue. The joint between them must accommodate these differences to be secure and leak-free.

## Why Connect PEX to PVC? Common Plumbing Scenarios

You might wonder why you would even need to connect PEX to PVC. Several common plumbing situations call for this specific connection. Understanding these scenarios helps highlight the importance of knowing the correct methods.

One frequent reason is when homeowners or plumbers perform a partial plumbing upgrade. You might have an existing PVC cold water supply line that needs extension or a new branch added using flexible PEX. For instance, connecting a new PEX line to an existing PVC manifold or stub-out. This allows you to leverage the benefits of PEX's flexibility for new runs while integrating with existing rigid PVC infrastructure.

Another common scenario involves repair or renovation of drainage systems. While PEX is not typically used for drainage, you might need to connect a PEX water supply line to a fixture that has a PVC drain. In some cases, a PEX water line might run alongside a PVC drain line. Although direct PEX-to-PVC drain connections are rare, you might need to transition from an existing PVC drain to another type of pipe for a specific repair. For example, you might be replacing a section of an old drain system. If you're working with older drain pipes, you might find yourself needing to connect to materials like cast iron. You can learn more about how to connect PVC to cast iron sewer pipe underground for your specific needs.

Sometimes, you might also replace sections of old piping. For instance, you could be removing a damaged section of PVC and opting for PEX for its ease of installation in tight spaces. Or, you might be connecting a new PEX hot water line to a hot water heater that has PVC pressure relief valve (PRV) piping. Each scenario demands a reliable PEX-to-PVC transition.

## Essential Tools and Materials for a Successful Connection

Gathering the right tools and materials before you start is crucial. This ensures a smooth and efficient connection process. Having everything on hand prevents frustrating delays and ensures a high-quality job.

Here is a list of what you will likely need:

*   **PEX Cutter:** This specialized tool provides clean, square cuts on PEX pipe. A regular utility knife can deform PEX, leading to poor connections.
*   **PVC Pipe Cutter or Hacksaw:** For cutting PVC pipe. A PVC cutter ensures a straight cut. If using a hacksaw, a miter box helps keep the cut straight.
*   **Deburring Tool or File:** After cutting, both PEX and PVC can have burrs or rough edges. Deburring creates a smooth surface for fittings.
*   **Tape Measure:** Accurate measurements are essential for cutting pipes to the correct length.
*   **Marker:** To mark cut lines on pipes.

For the connection fittings, you have several options:

*   **PEX Crimp Tool or PEX Clamp Tool:** If using crimp or stainless steel clamp rings for PEX connections.
*   **PEX Expansion Tool (for Uponor/ProPEX system):** If using expansion fittings.
*   **Transition Fittings:** These are the key. They often involve a male or female threaded PEX adapter and a corresponding PVC threaded adapter. Look for fittings labeled "PEX to NPT" (National Pipe Taper) or "PEX to FPT/MPT" (Female/Male Pipe Thread).
*   **Thread Sealant Tape (Teflon Tape) or Pipe Dope:** Essential for creating a watertight seal on threaded connections.
*   **Primer and PVC Solvent Cement:** If you are connecting the PVC side with a glued joint.
*   **Slip Couplings or Rubber Couplings (for drain applications):** These are flexible mechanical couplings. They work well for connecting pipes of different materials or slightly different diameters.
*   **Adjustable Wrenches:** For tightening threaded fittings.

Having these items ready saves time and makes the project much easier. It also helps you produce a professional-looking and leak-free connection.

## Choosing the Right Connection Method: Adapters and Fittings

Selecting the correct connection method is paramount for a reliable PEX to PVC joint. The best method depends heavily on whether the connection is for a pressure application (like water supply) or a non-pressure application (like drainage). Each type of fitting has specific uses and installation requirements.

For **pressure applications**, the most common and reliable method involves using threaded adapters. You cannot directly glue PEX to PVC. PEX pipes use mechanical connections. PVC pipes use solvent welding for permanent joints. Therefore, you need a transition fitting that bridges this gap.

1.  **PEX to Male Pipe Thread (MPT) Adapter:** This fitting has a PEX connection on one end (crimp, clamp, or push-to-connect) and male pipe threads on the other.
2.  **PVC Female Pipe Thread (FPT) Adapter:** This fitting has a socket for solvent welding to PVC pipe on one end and female pipe threads on the other.

You connect the PEX pipe to the PEX adapter using the appropriate PEX tool (crimper, clamp tool, or push-fit). Then, you apply thread sealant to the male threads of the PEX adapter and screw it into the female threads of the PVC adapter. Finally, you solvent weld the PVC adapter to the PVC pipe. This creates a secure, pressure-rated connection. Push-to-connect fittings, like SharkBite, offer a tool-free option for the PEX side, simplifying the process.

For **non-pressure (drainage) applications**, direct threaded connections are less common and often not required. Drainage systems operate under gravity, not pressure.

1.  **Rubber Transition Couplings (Fernco-style):** These flexible couplings are ideal for connecting pipes of different materials or sizes. They consist of a rubber sleeve with stainless steel clamps on each end. You simply slide the coupling over the PEX and PVC pipes and tighten the clamps. This method is very forgiving and accommodates slight misalignments.
2.  **PVC DWV Solvent Weld to PEX Adapter (less common):** Some specialized DWV fittings exist that allow a solvent weld to PVC and then transition to a PEX size. However, the rubber coupling is generally more versatile and widely accepted for drain applications.

Always ensure the fittings you choose are rated for the intended application (pressure or non-pressure) and compatible with local plumbing codes. Using the right fitting ensures the integrity and longevity of your plumbing system.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Connecting PEX to PVC for Water Supply (Pressure)

Connecting PEX to PVC for water supply lines requires precision. This ensures a leak-proof connection that can withstand water pressure. Let's walk through the process using threaded adapters.

### 1. Plan and Prepare Your Work Area

First, turn off the main water supply to the area where you will work. Drain any residual water from the pipes by opening a nearby faucet. Clear your workspace and gather all necessary tools and materials as discussed earlier. Safety first; make sure the area is well-lit.

### 2. Cut and Prepare PEX and PVC Pipes

Measure and mark the desired length for both your PEX and PVC pipes. Use a specialized PEX cutter to make a clean, square cut on the PEX pipe. This prevents damage to the pipe and ensures a good seal with the fitting. For the PVC pipe, use a PVC pipe cutter or a hacksaw to make a straight, clean cut. After cutting, use a deburring tool or a small file to smooth the inside and outside edges of both pipes. This step is critical for proper sealing and flow.

### 3. Install the PEX Adapter

Slide the PEX crimp ring or clamp onto the PEX pipe, about two inches from the end. Insert the barbed end of your PEX male threaded adapter fully into the PEX pipe. Ensure the pipe is pushed all the way to the shoulder of the fitting. Position the crimp ring or clamp over the barb section of the fitting. Use your PEX crimp tool or clamp tool to secure the ring. Squeeze the handles until the tool clicks, indicating a proper crimp. If using a push-to-connect fitting, simply push the PEX pipe firmly into the fitting until it seats.

### 4. Install the PVC Adapter

For the PVC side, you will use a PVC female threaded adapter. Clean the end of the PVC pipe and the inside of the PVC adapter socket with PVC primer. Apply a liberal amount of PVC solvent cement to both the outside of the PVC pipe end and the inside of the adapter's socket. Immediately push the PVC pipe fully into the adapter, giving it a slight twist to ensure even cement distribution. Hold it firmly for about 30 seconds to allow the cement to set. Allow the joint to cure for the time recommended by the solvent cement manufacturer (usually 15-30 minutes before handling, several hours before pressure testing).

### 5. Join the Threaded Connection

Once the PVC solvent weld joint has cured, you can connect the PEX and PVC parts. Apply thread sealant tape (Teflon tape) or pipe dope to the male threads of the PEX adapter. Wrap the tape clockwise around the threads 3-5 times. Carefully hand-tighten the PEX adapter into the PVC female threaded adapter. Then, use an adjustable wrench to tighten it another half to one full turn. Do not overtighten, as this can crack the PVC fitting.

### 6. Test for Leaks

With all connections made, slowly turn the main water supply back on. Carefully inspect the newly made joint for any signs of leaks. Check around the PEX connection, the threaded union, and the PVC solvent weld. A small drip can quickly become a big problem. If you find a leak, turn off the water and re-evaluate the connection. Sometimes, re-taping threads or ensuring the PEX connection is secure solves the issue. For more advanced PEX leak issues, understanding how to fix a leak in PEX radiant floor heating can offer insights into troubleshooting PEX systems.

By following these steps, you can confidently connect PEX to PVC for your water supply needs.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Connecting PEX to PVC for Drain Lines (Non-Pressure)

While PEX is primarily for water supply, you might need to integrate a new PEX-fed fixture into an existing PVC drainage system. The connection method for drain lines differs significantly from pressure lines. We often rely on mechanical couplings rather than threaded adapters.

### 1. Assess the Drainage System

Before you begin, understand the existing PVC drain line configuration. Drainage systems rely on gravity and proper slope. Ensure any new piping maintains the correct pitch for effective wastewater flow. Turn off any water supply connected to the fixture you are working on.

### 2. Cut and Prepare Pipes for Drainage

Measure and mark the section where you want to add or repair. Cut the existing PVC drain pipe using a PVC pipe cutter or hacksaw. Make sure your cuts are clean and straight. For the PEX pipe, use a PEX cutter for a precise, burr-free cut. Although PEX is less common for actual drain runs, if you are adapting a fixture connection, prepare it as needed. Deburr both the inside and outside edges of the cut pipes. This ensures a smooth flow path and helps fittings seat correctly.

### 3. Choose and Prepare Your Drain Transition Coupling

For non-pressure drain lines, a rubber transition coupling (like a Fernco coupling) is often the best choice. These couplings are flexible and designed to connect pipes of different materials or even slightly different outer diameters. Ensure the coupling you choose is the correct size for both the PEX (or the PEX adapter you are using) and the PVC pipe. Loosen the stainless steel clamps on both ends of the rubber coupling.

### 4. Install the Transition Coupling

Slide one end of the rubber coupling onto the PEX pipe. Ensure it goes past the area where the clamp will sit. Then, slide the other end of the coupling onto the PVC pipe. If you are connecting a PEX-fed fixture that has a PVC tailpiece, you would connect the fixture's PVC tailpiece directly into the coupling with the drain line. Position the coupling so that it bridges the gap between the two pipes evenly. Make sure both pipes are fully inserted into the coupling.

### 5. Secure the Clamps

Using a nut driver or a screwdriver, tighten the stainless steel clamps on both ends of the rubber coupling. Tighten them firmly but do not overtighten. Over-tightening can damage the rubber or the pipe. The goal is a snug, watertight seal that prevents drain water from leaking out. These clamps are designed to hold the pipes securely within the rubber sleeve.

### 6. Test the Drain Connection

Once the connection is secure, slowly turn on the water to the fixture connected to this drain. Run water through the drain for a few minutes. Carefully inspect the newly made connection for any signs of leaks. Look for drips or wet spots around the coupling. If you observe any leaks, turn off the water and re-tighten the clamps. Sometimes, repositioning the coupling slightly can also help.

Connecting PEX to PVC for drain lines, while less frequent for the PEX side, primarily uses these flexible, mechanical couplings. They are simple to install and highly effective for non-pressure applications. If you're working on a larger drain system, understanding how to replace cast iron pipe with PVC can also be helpful for modernizing your plumbing.

## Testing Your Connection and Troubleshooting Tips

After completing your PEX to PVC connection, testing is a non-negotiable step. A thorough test helps ensure your hard work results in a leak-free system. Catching leaks early prevents costly damage down the line.

### Pressure Testing for Water Supply Lines

For water supply connections, you must conduct a pressure test. This is the most reliable way to check for leaks.
1.  **Open Water Supply Slowly:** After your solvent cement has fully cured (check manufacturer's recommendations, usually several hours), slowly turn the main water supply back on. Do it gradually to avoid water hammer.
2.  **Inspect Visually:** Watch the newly made connection closely for any immediate drips or signs of moisture. Check around the PEX connection, the threaded joint, and the PVC solvent-welded area.
3.  **Check for Small Leaks:** Sometimes, a leak is not immediately obvious. Wipe the joint completely dry. Then, place a dry paper towel or toilet paper around the entire connection. Leave it for several minutes, or even an hour, and then check for any wet spots on the paper. This helps detect slow, subtle leaks.
4.  **Listen for Hissing:** A faint hissing sound can indicate a tiny pinhole leak, especially at threaded connections.

### Troubleshooting Leaks in Pressure Connections

*   **Leaking at PEX Connection (Crimp/Clamp):** If your PEX connection is leaking, it often means the crimp or clamp was not properly seated or tightened. Turn off the water, cut out the leaking fitting, and re-do the connection with a new fitting and ring. Ensure your crimp/clamp tool is properly calibrated.
*   **Leaking at Threaded Connection:** This is a common spot. Turn off the water. Unscrew the threaded fitting. Remove all old thread sealant tape or pipe dope. Reapply fresh Teflon tape, wrapping it clockwise 4-6 times, ensuring it's snug in the threads. Alternatively, use a generous amount of high-quality pipe dope. Re-tighten the connection firmly, but avoid overtightening PVC, as it can crack.
*   **Leaking at PVC Solvent Weld:** A leak here is more problematic. It usually means the joint was not primed properly, not enough cement was applied, or it was not held long enough during curing. The only reliable fix is to cut out the leaking section and re-do the entire PVC joint with new pipe and fittings. This highlights the importance of proper technique during the initial installation.

### Testing for Drain Lines (Non-Pressure)

For drain lines, simply run water through the system.
1.  **Run Water:** Allow water to flow through the drain connected to your new joint. For a sink, fill it with water and then let it drain.
2.  **Visual Inspection:** Carefully check the entire connection, especially around rubber couplings, for any drips or wetness.
3.  **Listen and Observe:** Listen for any gurgling sounds that might indicate an airlock or improper slope, though direct leaks are your primary concern here.

### Troubleshooting Leaks in Drain Connections

*   **Leaking at Rubber Coupling:** If a rubber coupling is leaking, turn off the water to the fixture. Ensure both pipes are fully seated within the coupling. Then, firmly tighten the stainless steel clamps on both ends. Make sure the clamps are directly over the pipe and not on the edge of the rubber. Sometimes, applying a thin bead of silicone caulk around the ends of the coupling (where it meets the pipe) can provide an extra layer of seal, though this should not be a substitute for proper clamping.
*   **Persistent Drain Leaks:** If tightening doesn't work, the coupling might be the wrong size or defective. You might need to replace the coupling. Ensure the pipes are cut cleanly and are free of burrs that could compromise the seal.

Thorough testing and prompt troubleshooting prevent minor issues from becoming major plumbing disasters. Remember that patience and attention to detail are your best allies in plumbing projects.

## Safety Precautions and Best Practices for Plumbing

Working with plumbing systems involves inherent risks. Following safety precautions and best practices protects you and ensures a successful, long-lasting installation. Never rush a plumbing job.

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Always start by protecting yourself.
*   **Safety Glasses:** Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from debris, cutting particles, or splashes of primer/cement.
*   **Gloves:** Use work gloves to protect your hands from cuts and chemicals. When working with PVC primer and cement, chemical-resistant gloves are advisable.
*   **Respirator:** When using PVC primer and cement in enclosed spaces, wear a respirator. The fumes can be strong and irritating to your respiratory system. Ensure good ventilation.

### Working with Water and Electricity

*   **Turn Off Water Supply:** Always turn off the main water supply valve before cutting into any water lines. This prevents flooding. Drain the lines by opening a faucet at the lowest point of the system.
*   **Power Off Appliances:** If working near water heaters, garbage disposals, or any electrical appliances connected to your plumbing, turn off their power at the circuit breaker. Water and electricity are a dangerous combination.

### Proper Tool Usage

*   **Read Tool Manuals:** Understand how to use each tool properly. A PEX crimp tool or expansion tool requires specific calibration and technique.
*   **Sharp Blades:** Use sharp cutters for both PEX and PVC. Dull blades can lead to uneven cuts, splintering, or deformation, which compromise the seal of your connections.
*   **Stable Work Surface:** Ensure pipes are stable when cutting to prevent slips and inaccurate cuts.

### Best Practices for Connections

*   **Cleanliness:** Keep all pipe ends and fitting surfaces clean and free of dirt, grease, or moisture. Even small contaminants can compromise a seal.
*   **Deburring:** Always deburr pipe ends. Sharp edges can damage O-rings in fittings or prevent proper seating.
*   **Dry Fit:** For solvent weld joints, dry fit the pipe into the fitting first to ensure a proper fit. It should go in about one-third to half of the way easily. If it's too loose or too tight, you might have the wrong size.
*   **Adequate Curing Time:** For PVC solvent cement, respect the manufacturer's recommended curing times before applying pressure. Rushing this step is a leading cause of leaks.
*   **Thread Sealant:** For threaded connections, use enough thread sealant (Teflon tape or pipe dope), but don't overdo it. Too much can prevent threads from seating fully or even cause blockages if it breaks off inside the pipe.
*   **Avoid Overtightening:** Especially with PVC, overtightening can crack fittings. For threaded joints, "snug plus a quarter to half turn" after hand-tightening is often sufficient.
*   **Support Pipes:** Ensure pipes are adequately supported after installation to prevent stress on joints. This is particularly important for long runs or transitions where different materials meet.
*   **Code Compliance:** Always check local plumbing codes. Some jurisdictions have specific requirements for pipe materials, connection methods, or even how close connections can be to other structures.

By adhering to these safety precautions and best practices, you can approach your PEX to PVC connection with confidence. You ensure a safe working environment and achieve professional, durable results.

## Longevity and Maintenance of Your PEX-to-PVC Connection

Once you successfully connect PEX pipe to PVC, ensuring the longevity and reliability of that connection becomes the next priority. While properly installed joints are designed to last, understanding maintenance and potential issues helps extend their lifespan.

### Factors Affecting Longevity

Several factors influence how long your PEX-to-PVC connection will last.
*   **Installation Quality:** This is the most critical factor. Correct cutting, deburring, proper use of crimp tools, adequate solvent welding, and careful tightening of threaded connections ensure a durable joint. Any shortcuts can lead to premature failure.
*   **Water Quality:** Hard water or water with high mineral content can cause scale buildup inside pipes and fittings over time. This can affect flow and potentially degrade certain types of fittings. Corrosive water can also impact metal components in fittings.
*   **Temperature and Pressure Fluctuations:** Extreme or rapid changes in temperature and pressure can stress connections. While both PEX and PVC tolerate a range, constant fluctuations can wear down seals. PEX is more flexible and handles freezing better than PVC.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Exposure to UV light can degrade PVC over time, making it brittle. Ensure outdoor PVC is protected. Physical stress, such as pipes vibrating or shifting due to inadequate support, can also weaken joints.
*   **Chemical Exposure:** While both materials are chemical-resistant, exposure to harsh chemicals not intended for plumbing use can cause degradation.

### Maintenance Tips

Generally, PEX-to-PVC connections, once properly installed, require minimal active maintenance. However, regular inspection is a good practice.
*   **Periodic Visual Inspections:** If the connection is accessible (e.g., under a sink, in an unfinished basement), periodically check it for any signs of leaks, moisture, corrosion, or material degradation.
*   **Check for Signs of Stress:** Look for cracks, bulges, or discoloration, particularly around solvent-welded PVC joints or overtightened threaded connections.
*   **Monitor Water Pressure:** If you notice unusually high water pressure in your home, it can stress all plumbing connections. Consider installing a pressure reducing valve (PRV) if your incoming pressure is consistently above 80 PSI.
*   **Address Leaks Promptly:** Even a small drip can indicate a problem that will worsen over time. Address any leaks immediately.

### Potential Issues and When to Call a Professional

*   **Persistent Leaks:** If you have tried troubleshooting a leak and cannot stop it, the joint might be faulty, or you might have a hidden crack. It's time to call a licensed plumber.
*   **Low Water Pressure or Clogs:** While not directly related to the PEX-to-PVC joint itself, issues like persistent low water pressure or recurring clogs might indicate broader plumbing problems that a professional can diagnose. Sometimes, a general pipe cleaning might be needed. If you're encountering slow drains or blockages, learning how to clean pipe can be a helpful skill.
*   **Code Compliance:** If you are unsure about local plumbing codes or the complexity of your connection, a professional can ensure your work meets all requirements.

A well-executed PEX to PVC connection should provide many years of reliable service. By understanding how to properly install and occasionally monitor these joints, you contribute to the overall health of your home's plumbing system.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Can you glue PEX to PVC directly?
No, you cannot glue PEX to PVC directly. PEX is a flexible cross-linked polyethylene that does not bond with solvent cement. PVC is a rigid polyvinyl chloride that uses solvent cement for chemical welding. To connect them, you must use a mechanical transition fitting, such as a PEX adapter connected to a PVC threaded adapter or a rubber coupling.

### What is the best fitting for PEX to PVC?
For pressure water supply lines, the best fitting is typically a PEX adapter (crimp, clamp, or push-to-connect) that transitions to male threads, which then screws into a solvent-welded PVC female threaded adapter. For non-pressure drain lines, a rubber transition coupling (like a Fernco coupling) is often the most reliable and versatile option.

### Is PEX compatible with PVC for drainage?
While PEX itself is generally not used for drain lines due to its flexibility and lack of rigid support for gravity flow, you can connect PEX water supply lines to fixtures that use PVC drain lines. When making a direct PEX pipe to PVC drain pipe connection, a rubber transition coupling is the standard method for a secure, non-pressure joint.

### Can PEX be used for the main water line?
Yes, PEX can be used for the main water line from the meter into the house, provided it is rated for the incoming pressure and approved by local codes. Its flexibility reduces the need for many fittings. However, it requires proper burial depth and protection from rodents or UV light if run outdoors.

### Do I need special tools for PEX?
Yes, connecting PEX typically requires special tools. For crimp fittings, you need a PEX crimp tool. For clamp fittings, you need a PEX clamp tool. For expansion fittings (like Uponor/ProPEX), you need a PEX expansion tool. Push-to-connect fittings, like SharkBite, are an exception as they do not require special tools for installation.

### What's the difference between PEX and PVC pipes?
PEX (cross-linked polyethylene) is a flexible plastic pipe used primarily for hot and cold-water supply lines. It resists corrosion and freezing. PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is a rigid plastic pipe used mainly for drainage, waste, and vent (DWV) systems, as well as some cold-water supply lines. PEX connects with mechanical fittings, while PVC connects with solvent cement.
