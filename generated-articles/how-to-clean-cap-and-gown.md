## Clean Your Cap and Gown for Graduation

Graduation day is a momentous occasion. Your cap and gown symbolize years of hard work and dedication. Keeping these cherished items clean ensures they look their best for photographs and ceremonies. Often, these garments gather dust or wrinkles from storage, or sometimes they need freshening after the event. Understanding how to clean cap and gown properly helps preserve them. This comprehensive guide provides step-by-step instructions. We cover identifying fabric types, pre-treating stains, washing methods, and correct drying techniques. We also discuss proper storage to keep your academic regalia pristine for years.

### Takeaway

*   Identify the fabric of your cap and gown before cleaning.
*   Spot treat stains gently with a mild detergent.
*   Hand wash gowns for best results; machine wash only if the care label allows, using cold water and a gentle cycle.
*   Clean your graduation cap by spot cleaning only.
*   Air dry gowns away from direct heat or sunlight.

To clean a cap and gown, first check the care label for specific instructions. Most gowns are polyester and require gentle hand washing or spot cleaning. The cap often contains cardboard and should only be spot cleaned. Air dry the gown completely to prevent damage.

## Understanding Your Cap and Gown Materials

Knowing the material of your cap and gown is the first step in cleaning them correctly. Most graduation gowns are made from polyester. This synthetic fabric is durable and wrinkle-resistant. However, some academic regalia, especially for higher degrees or faculty, might be made from acetate, rayon, or even silk. Each material has different cleaning requirements.

The care label inside your gown provides the best guidance. It tells you if the garment is machine washable, hand wash only, or dry clean only. Following these instructions helps prevent damage. If a label is missing, assume the most delicate method is necessary. This approach protects the fabric from shrinking, fading, or getting damaged.

Your graduation cap usually has a stiff cardboard insert. This insert gives the cap its shape. The cap material is often polyester or a blend. Because of the cardboard, you cannot immerse the cap in water. Water can warp the cardboard and ruin the cap's shape.

Tassels are typically made of rayon or polyester. They are generally colorfast. You can spot clean tassels or gently hand wash them separately if needed. Ribbons or special adornments might also be present. Check these for delicate stitching or materials that require extra care. Proper material identification ensures safe cleaning.

## Pre-Cleaning Steps and Spot Treatment

Before you begin the main cleaning process, prepare your cap and gown. This preparation includes shaking off loose dirt and addressing any specific stains. Pre-cleaning steps make the overall washing process more effective. They help ensure your academic regalia looks its best.

First, hang your gown and shake it gently. This removes dust, lint, or any loose debris. Use a lint roller to pick up any remaining fibers or pet hair. Inspect the entire gown and cap for noticeable stains or spots. Common stains include food spills, makeup marks, or general grime from wear.

For spot treatment, act quickly. The sooner you treat a stain, the easier it is to remove. Do a patch test first. Apply a small amount of your chosen cleaner to an inconspicuous area. This might be an inner seam or the back of a collar. Wait a few minutes to ensure the cleaner does not cause discoloration or damage.

Use a mild detergent mixed with cool water for most stains. Apply the solution to a clean cloth. Gently blot the stained area. Do not rub vigorously, as this can spread the stain or damage the fabric fibers. Work from the outside of the stain towards the center. For tougher stains, consider using a gentle stain remover specifically designed for delicate fabrics. Always follow the product's instructions. Remember, the cap should only be spot treated due to its cardboard core.

## Gentle Hand Washing Your Gown

Hand washing is often the safest and most recommended method for cleaning a graduation gown. This method provides maximum control over the cleaning process. It helps protect delicate fabrics and intricate details on your academic regalia. This approach prevents shrinkage and preserves the gown's original shape.

First, fill a clean basin or bathtub with cool or lukewarm water. Hot water can cause fading or shrinking, especially with polyester. Add a small amount of mild liquid detergent designed for delicate garments. Swirl the water gently to mix the detergent evenly. Avoid harsh soaps or bleaches.

Carefully immerse your graduation gown into the soapy water. Ensure the entire garment is submerged. Gently swish the gown around in the water for a few minutes. Focus on areas that appear soiled. Do not twist, scrub, or wring the fabric harshly. Excessive force can damage the fibers or alter the gown's drape. You are simply allowing the water and detergent to lift away dirt.

After a few minutes of gentle agitation, drain the soapy water. Refill the basin with clean, cool water. Rinse the gown thoroughly. Continue to drain and refill the basin until all soap residue is gone. The water should run clear. Gently press excess water out of the gown without twisting it.

## Machine Washing Your Gown Safely

While hand washing is preferable for most graduation gowns, some polyester gowns are suitable for machine washing. Always check the care label before attempting this method. Machine washing offers convenience but carries a higher risk of damage if not done correctly. Follow these steps to ensure safe machine cleaning.

First, prepare your gown for the wash. Close all zippers, buttons, or clasps. Turn the gown inside out. This protects the outer surface and any embellishments from abrasion. Place the gown inside a mesh laundry bag. A laundry bag provides an extra layer of protection. It prevents tangling with other items and reduces stress on the fabric. If your gown has significant stains, pre-treat them before placing it in the machine.

Next, load the washing machine. Wash the gown by itself or with other similar, lightweight items. Avoid washing it with heavy items like jeans or towels. These can create friction and damage the delicate fabric. Set your washing machine to a gentle cycle or delicate setting. Use cold water. Cold water helps prevent shrinking, fading, and damage to the fabric fibers.

Add a small amount of mild laundry detergent. Avoid using harsh chemicals, bleach, or fabric softeners, as these can leave residue or damage the polyester. Once the cycle finishes, promptly remove the gown from the machine. Do not leave it sitting in the drum wet. Excess moisture can lead to wrinkles or mildew.

## Caring for Your Graduation Cap

The graduation cap requires special attention due to its unique construction. Most caps contain a stiff cardboard insert to maintain their flat, square shape. This cardboard cannot get wet, so traditional washing methods are not suitable for the cap. Cleaning the cap involves targeted spot treatment and freshening.

Inspect your cap for any visible marks or dirt. Common issues include makeup stains around the brim, fingerprints, or dust. For light dust, use a soft-bristled brush or a lint roller. Gently brush away any surface debris. This initial step removes loose particles and prepares the cap for deeper cleaning if needed.

For stains, use a very lightly dampened cloth with a small amount of mild detergent. Dip a corner of a clean white cloth into the solution. Wring out excess moisture very thoroughly. The cloth should be barely damp. Gently blot the stained area. Work from the outside of the stain inward. Avoid saturating the fabric, as water can quickly seep into the cardboard. Immediately blot the area with a dry cloth to absorb any moisture.

You can also use a mixture of water and white vinegar for freshening. Mix equal parts water and white vinegar in a spray bottle. Lightly mist the fabric surface of the cap. Do not over-spray. This helps neutralize odors without getting the cardboard wet. Allow the cap to air dry completely in a well-ventilated area. Do not attempt to machine wash or submerge your cap. It will lose its shape permanently.

## Drying and Wrinkle Removal

Proper drying is crucial for maintaining the shape and integrity of your cap and gown. Incorrect drying can cause shrinking, excessive wrinkling, or even damage the fabric. Avoid using a machine dryer for your graduation gown whenever possible. High heat can cause polyester to shrink or become permanently wrinkled.

After washing your gown, gently squeeze out any excess water. Do not twist or wring the fabric, as this can stretch or damage it. Lay the gown flat on a clean, dry towel. Roll the gown and towel together to absorb more moisture. This helps remove a significant amount of water without stressing the fabric.

Hang the gown on a sturdy padded hanger. Choose a hanger that supports the shoulders well to prevent stretching or creasing. Hang it in a well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight or direct heat sources like radiators. These can cause fading or damage. Allow the gown to air dry completely. This process may take several hours, or even overnight, depending on humidity levels. Ensure it is completely dry before storing it.

For wrinkles, steaming is the best method. Use a garment steamer to gently remove wrinkles. Hold the steamer a few inches away from the fabric. Allow the steam to relax the fibers. If you do not have a steamer, hang the gown in the bathroom while you take a hot shower. The steam from the shower can help release wrinkles. Alternatively, iron the gown on the lowest heat setting appropriate for polyester, using a pressing cloth to protect the fabric. Always test a small, inconspicuous area first.

## Proper Storage for Longevity

Once your cap and gown are clean and completely dry, proper storage ensures their longevity. Good storage practices prevent damage, wrinkles, and dust buildup. This keeps your academic regalia ready for future use or as a cherished keepsake. Avoid simply tossing them into a closet or box.

Store your graduation gown on a padded hanger. This helps maintain its shape and prevents creases in the shoulders. Use a hanger that is wide enough to support the garment's weight without causing bumps. Place the hung gown inside a breathable garment bag. A garment bag protects it from dust, light, and insects. Avoid plastic dry-cleaning bags for long-term storage. These can trap moisture and cause yellowing or mildew over time. Fabric garment bags, like those made from cotton or non-woven materials, allow air circulation.

For the graduation cap, avoid flattening it. This can damage the cardboard insert. Store the cap on a flat surface or in a sturdy box. Place it on top of the gown within the garment bag if space allows. Alternatively, use a separate hat box to maintain its shape. Ensure the cap is completely dry before storing to prevent mildew or mold. The tassel can be stored with the cap or hung with the gown.

Store the garment bag in a cool, dry place. Avoid basements or attics, as these areas often have fluctuating temperatures and humidity levels. A closet inside your home is ideal. Keeping your academic regalia clean and stored correctly ensures it remains in pristine condition for years to come.
