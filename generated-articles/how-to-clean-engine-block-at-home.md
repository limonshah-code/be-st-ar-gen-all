5.  **Place Drip Pans/Cardboard Underneath:** Position these under the engine. They will catch the runoff from the cleaning process. This helps contain the mess and protects your driveway or garage floor.
6.  **Consider Raising the Car (Optional):** If you need better access to the underside of the engine block, use jack stands. Always use jack stands for safety. Never rely only on a jack. This step is helpful for very thorough cleaning.

### The Step-by-Step Process to Degrease Your Engine Block

Now that your engine is prepped, it is time for the main event: degreasing. This is where you remove the stubborn oil, grease, and grime that have built up. A thorough degreasing ensures a clean surface. It also helps you identify any potential leaks. I find this part very satisfying.

Applying the degreaser correctly is essential. You want good coverage without over-saturating sensitive areas. Scrubbing effectively removes years of buildup. Take your time and be methodical.

Here is how to properly degrease your engine block:

1.  **Apply Degreaser Generously:**
    *   Shake the degreaser can well.
    *   Spray the degreaser evenly over the entire engine block. Focus on areas with heavy grease and oil buildup. This includes the block itself, oil pan, and transmission casing if accessible.
    *   Avoid spraying directly onto covered electrical components.
    *   Ensure good ventilation if you are in a garage.
2.  **Allow the Degreaser to Soak:**
    *   Read the product instructions for the recommended soak time. This is usually 5-15 minutes.
    *   Do not let the degreaser dry on the surface. If it starts to dry, mist it lightly with water or reapply degreaser. This ensures it continues to break down the grime.
3.  **Scrub Stubborn Areas:**
    *   While the degreaser is working, use your stiff bristle brushes. Scrub the engine block vigorously.
    *   Focus on areas with thick grime, baked-on oil, or carbon deposits.
    *   Use wire brushes (brass or nylon) for heavily soiled metal parts. Be gentle on softer metals like aluminum.
    *   For tight spaces, use detailing brushes or an old toothbrush. These can get into small crevices effectively.
    *   You might encounter various types of buildup. Heavy [engine sludge](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-sludge-from-engine) can be particularly challenging. Work slowly on these areas. Sometimes, [cleaning engine oil sludge](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-engine-oil-sludge) requires multiple applications.
    *   If you notice [carbon buildup in the engine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-carbon-buildup-in-engine), specific scrubbers might be needed for that. These areas often need extra attention.
