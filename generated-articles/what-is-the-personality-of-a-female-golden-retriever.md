## Maturity and Behavioral Changes in Female Golden Retrievers

The personality of a female Golden Retriever evolves through different life stages. Puppyhood is a time of boundless energy and curiosity. Adolescence brings some testing of boundaries. Adulthood settles into a more consistent temperament. Understanding these changes helps owners provide appropriate care. My female Golden was a whirlwind as a puppy.

During adolescence (roughly 6 months to 2 years), you might see increased independence. They might also show some selective hearing. This phase requires consistent training and patience. It is a normal part of development. They are still learning their place in the world.
