## Essential Supplies for Cleaning Your New Balance 990 Sneakers

Before you begin to clean New Balance 990s, gather your tools. Having everything ready makes the process smooth. Using the right products protects your shoes. This avoids damage to delicate materials.

You will need a few basic items. These include soft brushes, cleaners, and cloths. Make sure your brushes are gentle on different surfaces. Harsh brushes can scratch or scuff materials. A good cleaning solution will lift dirt without harming the fabric.

### What You Will Need

I always lay out my supplies before I start. This keeps me organized and efficient. Here is a list of what you should have:

*   **Soft-bristled brush:** An old toothbrush works well for small areas. A dedicated shoe brush is even better.
*   **Suede brush and eraser:** These are a must for the suede sections on your 990s. They lift dirt and restore nap. You can find these in most shoe care kits.
*   **Mild soap or shoe cleaner:** Dish soap mixed with water is a common choice. Specialized sneaker cleaners are also good. Avoid strong detergents.
*   **Microfiber cloths:** These are soft and absorbent. They will not leave lint on your shoes.
*   **Small bowls:** Use one for your cleaning solution and another for clean water.
*   **Paper towels or old rags:** For blotting excess moisture.
*   **Shoe trees or crumpled paper:** To help shoes keep their shape while drying. Do not use newspaper, as ink can transfer.

Using these supplies ensures a thorough clean. It also helps preserve the integrity of your New Balance 990s. Remember, gentle care extends the life of your favorite pair.

## Preparing Your 990s for a Deep Clean

Preparation is the first vital step in how to clean New Balance 990 shoes properly. You want to remove all loose dirt before wet cleaning. This prevents dirt from spreading or embedding further into the material. A good initial scrub makes the deeper cleaning much easier.

I always start with this dry cleaning phase. It sets the stage for a better outcome. Skipping this step can lead to muddy messes when you add water. Taking a few minutes here saves a lot of time later.

### Steps for Pre-Cleaning

Here is how I prepare my New Balance 990s:

1.  **Remove laces and insoles:** Take out your laces. You can wash these separately. Pull out the insoles too. This lets them air out and helps you clean inside the shoe. You can wash your insoles gently with soap and water, then let them air dry.
2.  **Brush off loose dirt:** Use your soft-bristled brush. Start by gently brushing away any loose dirt from the upper, midsole, and outsole. Pay attention to the grooves on the sole. This step is critical for preventing mud from forming when water is applied.
3.  **Address stubborn dry mud:** For dried mud stuck in the sole's treads, a stiff brush works best. You can also use a dull knife or stick to carefully pick out larger pieces. Be careful not to damage the rubber. I use firm strokes to get rid of every bit of grime.
4.  **Use a suede brush on suede areas:** For the suede parts, use a dedicated suede brush. Brush in one direction to lift surface dirt. For small scuffs or marks on suede, gently rub with a suede eraser. This can often remove light stains without any liquid. This preparation is very important, as suede reacts poorly to too much moisture. You can find more details on cleaning suede specifically here: [How To Clean New Balance Suede Shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-suede-shoes).

This initial cleaning makes a big difference. It ensures you are working with a clean surface before introducing any liquids. Your New Balance 990s are now ready for the main cleaning.

## Deep Cleaning the Mesh and Midsole of Your 990s

Once your shoes are prepped, it's time for the deeper clean. The mesh and foam midsole parts of your New Balance 990s need careful attention. These materials can attract dirt, but they are also quite durable. You need a gentle solution to clean them effectively.

I find that a mild soap solution works wonders. It lifts grime without harsh chemicals. This method keeps the material soft and intact. Always test your cleaning solution on a small, hidden area first.

### Cleaning Mesh Uppers

The mesh on New Balance 990s is breathable but can trap dust. Here is my method for cleaning it:

1.  **Create a cleaning solution:** Mix a small amount of mild dish soap or sneaker cleaner with warm water in a bowl. You want a foamy, gentle mixture. A little goes a long way.
2.  **Dampen your brush:** Dip your soft-bristled brush into the solution. Make sure it is damp, not soaking wet. Excess water can saturate the shoe.
3.  **Gently scrub the mesh:** Work the brush over the mesh in small, circular motions. Focus on soiled areas. Apply light pressure. Scrubbing too hard can damage the mesh fibers.
4.  **Wipe with a clean cloth:** Dip a microfiber cloth in clean water and wring it out well. Use this cloth to wipe away the soap residue and lifted dirt from the mesh. Rinse the cloth often. Repeat until all soap is gone.

### Cleaning the Foam Midsole

The white or off-white midsole often shows dirt easily. Cleaning it makes a big difference in the shoe's overall appearance.

1.  **Apply cleaning solution:** Dip your brush into the same mild soap solution. You can use an old toothbrush for precision.
2.  **Scrub the midsole:** Gently scrub the midsole in circular motions. For tougher stains, you can use a bit more pressure. The foam is more resilient than the mesh.
3.  **Wipe clean:** Use your clean, damp microfiber cloth to wipe away the suds and dirt. Make sure no soap residue remains. You want the midsole to look bright again. For stubborn white parts, a slightly stiffer brush might be needed, but still be careful not to scrub the mesh or suede directly. This method is similar to general shoe cleaning techniques, as detailed in [How To Clean Shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes).

This approach ensures your mesh and midsole are clean without harm. They will look much brighter after this step.

## Special Care for New Balance 990 Suede Sections

New Balance 990 models often feature premium suede overlays. Suede needs special treatment. Water can easily stain or damage suede if not handled correctly. This is the part that often worries people most.

I have learned that patience and the right tools are key here. You want to lift dirt without making the suede stiff or discolored. Always remember, less water is more when it comes to suede.

### Suede Cleaning Techniques

Here is how I approach cleaning the suede on my 990s:

1.  **Start dry:** As mentioned in preparation, use your suede brush to remove loose dirt. Brush in one direction to lift the nap. Use a suede eraser for scuffs. This is usually enough for light marks.
2.  **For stubborn stains (minimal moisture):** If you have a stubborn stain, you can use a tiny amount of specialized suede cleaner. Some people use a mixture of white vinegar and water (1:1 ratio). Lightly dampen a corner of a clean microfiber cloth with the solution. Do not spray or pour directly onto the suede.
3.  **Gently blot and rub:** Dab the stained area very gently. Do not rub hard. You want to lift the stain, not spread it. Rubbing too hard can damage the suede's nap.
4.  **Use a suede brush again:** Once the area is dry, use your suede brush to restore the nap. Brush back and forth to lift the fibers and make the suede soft again. This step is essential for the suede's appearance.

### Important Suede Reminders

*   **Avoid saturation:** Never soak suede. Water stains are hard to remove.
*   **Air dry naturally:** Let suede dry completely away from direct heat or sunlight. Heat can shrink or harden suede.
*   **Test first:** Always test any liquid cleaner on an unseen spot. This helps avoid unexpected discoloration.

Taking these steps ensures your New Balance 990 suede stays soft and vibrant. Proper care maintains the luxurious feel of the shoe. For a more detailed guide on suede, check out [How To Clean New Balance Suede Shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-suede-shoes).

## Cleaning the Outsole and Inner Linings of Your 990s

After cleaning the upper and midsole, focus on the outsole and the shoe's interior. The outsole picks up a lot of grime from the ground. The inner lining can harbor odors and sweat. Addressing these parts completes the clean.

I find that neglecting the outsole makes the whole shoe look less clean. And a fresh-smelling interior is a must. These final steps make your New Balance 990s truly fresh, top to bottom.

### Tackling the Outsole

The rubber outsole is durable but can hold onto dirt.

1.  **Scrub with a stiff brush:** Use a stiffer brush or even an old toothbrush. Dip it in your mild soap solution.
2.  **Work into grooves:** Vigorously scrub the rubber outsole. Pay extra attention to the treads and edges where dirt collects. You can use more pressure here than on the upper.
3.  **Rinse thoroughly:** Rinse the outsole with clean water. You can hold the shoe under a faucet, but be careful not to wet the suede or inner parts too much. Wipe down with a clean, damp cloth.
4.  **Check for pebbles:** Make sure no small pebbles or debris remain stuck in the treads. These can scratch floors or make walking uncomfortable.

### Refreshing Inner Linings

The inside of your New Balance 990s absorbs sweat and can develop odors.

1.  **Damp cloth wipe-down:** Lightly dampen a clean cloth with your mild soap solution. Gently wipe the inside lining of the shoe. Avoid soaking the interior.
2.  **Odor control:** For strong odors, you can sprinkle a little baking soda inside the shoes after cleaning and drying. Let it sit overnight. Then, shake it out the next morning. You can also use shoe deodorizers.
3.  **Clean the insoles:** Remember the insoles you removed earlier. Clean them separately using your mild soap solution and a soft brush. Rinse well and air dry completely. They should be fully dry before putting them back in.

By taking care of these areas, you ensure a complete clean. Your New Balance 990s will not just look good, but they will also feel fresh and comfortable.

## Drying and Protecting Your New Balance 990s

Proper drying is a critical step after you clean New Balance 990 shoes. Incorrect drying can lead to damage. This includes shrinkage, stiff materials, or even mold growth. Protection helps keep them clean longer.

I always emphasize patience during the drying phase. Rushing it can undo all your hard work. Once dry, applying a protector creates a shield against future dirt. This makes future cleaning easier.

### Drying Your 990s

Follow these steps for optimal drying:

1.  **Blot excess water:** Use a clean, dry microfiber cloth or paper towels. Gently blot all surfaces of the shoe to remove as much surface moisture as possible. This speeds up drying time.
2.  **Stuff with paper or use shoe trees:** Loosely stuff the shoes with crumpled paper towels or use shoe trees. This helps maintain the shoe's shape as it dries. Avoid using newspaper as the ink can transfer.
3.  **Air dry naturally:** Place your New Balance 990s in a well-ventilated area. Keep them away from direct sunlight or heat sources like radiators. Direct heat can warp the materials, especially suede. Allow at least 24-48 hours for complete drying. Suede needs to dry slowly to prevent stiffness.
4.  **Re-brush suede (once dry):** After the suede is completely dry, use your suede brush again. Brush in various directions to restore the nap and softness. This brings the suede back to life.

### Protecting Your 990s for Future Wear

Protection is a smart investment. It keeps your shoes looking great between cleanings.

1.  **Apply a protective spray:** Once your shoes are fully dry, apply a water and stain repellent spray. Choose one safe for mixed materials like suede and mesh. Follow the product's instructions carefully. This spray creates an invisible barrier. It repels water and makes dirt less likely to stick.
2.  **Regular maintenance:** Do quick clean-ups regularly. Brush off dirt after each wear. Wipe down the midsoles if they get dirty. This proactive approach prevents deep stains from setting in. This kind of regular maintenance is similar to general shoe care, as outlined in [How To Clean Shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes).

By following these drying and protection steps, your New Balance 990s will remain in excellent condition. They will be ready for your next adventure.

## Important Tips and What to Avoid When Cleaning New Balance 990s

Knowing what *not* to do is as important as knowing what to do. Certain practices can damage your New Balance 990s permanently. Avoid these pitfalls to preserve your shoes. Missteps can lead to material degradation or stubborn stains.

I have learned from experience what works and what does not. Following these tips will save you time and potential heartache. Proper care extends the life and look of your valuable sneakers.

### Key Tips for Success

*   **Act quickly on stains:** The sooner you address a fresh stain, the easier it is to remove. Do not let spills sit.
*   **Test cleaners first:** Always test any new cleaning solution on a small, hidden spot. This ensures it does not cause discoloration or damage.
*   **Be gentle:** Most shoe materials are delicate. Use light pressure when scrubbing, especially on mesh and suede.
*   **Separate cleaning tools:** Have separate brushes for general cleaning and for suede. This prevents cross-contamination of dirt or moisture.
*   **Store properly:** When not wearing your 990s, store them in a cool, dry place. Keep them away from direct sunlight. Using shoe trees helps them keep their shape.
*   **Laces and insoles:** Clean your laces separately. You can machine wash them in a mesh bag. Hand wash insoles and let them air dry completely.

### What to Absolutely Avoid

*   **Machine washing:** Never put your New Balance 990s in a washing machine. The harsh cycles and high heat can damage the materials, adhesives, and shape. This is especially true for the delicate suede.
*   **Harsh chemicals:** Avoid bleach, strong detergents, or abrasive cleaners. These can strip color, dry out materials, or cause permanent damage. Stick to mild soap or specialized shoe cleaners.
*   **Direct heat for drying:** Do not use hair dryers, radiators, or direct sunlight to dry your shoes. This can cause suede to shrink and harden. It can also warp the foam and rubber parts.
*   **Soaking suede:** Do not immerse suede areas in water. Suede is highly susceptible to water stains and can become stiff or discolored when soaked. This is a common mistake that is hard to fix. For more on suede, see [How To Clean New Balance Suede Shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-suede-shoes).
*   **Abrasive scrubbing:** Do not use stiff brushes or scrub too hard on mesh or suede. This can fray fibers, scratch surfaces, or damage the nap of the suede.

By following these simple guidelines, you will keep your New Balance 990s in top condition. They will maintain their comfort and style for many years.

## Advanced Techniques and Stain Removal for Tougher Marks

Sometimes, your New Balance 990s might have more stubborn marks. Regular cleaning may not be enough for these. Knowing a few advanced tricks can help. These methods target specific types of stains effectively.

I have faced my share of tough stains. A little extra effort and the right technique can make a big difference. It is rewarding to see a challenging stain disappear. Always proceed with caution.

### Tackling Specific Stains

Here are some approaches for trickier marks:

*   **Oil and grease stains (on mesh):**
    1.  Sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder on the stain. Let it sit for several hours, or even overnight. This helps absorb the oil.
    2.  Brush off the powder.
    3.  Then, clean the area with your mild soap solution and a soft brush.
    *This method is less effective on suede, where oil stains are very difficult to remove.*

*   **Scuff marks (on midsole/rubber):**
    1.  For light scuffs on the rubber midsole, a magic eraser can work wonders.
    2.  Lightly dampen the magic eraser.
    3.  Gently rub the scuff mark. Be careful not to rub too hard or get it on the mesh or suede. The magic eraser acts as a fine abrasive.
    4.  Wipe away any residue with a clean cloth. This is a popular trick for white rubber. This can also apply to general [How To Clean White New Balance Shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-new-balance-shoes) guidelines.

*   **Grass stains (on mesh/laces):**
    1.  Mix a small amount of laundry detergent with water to form a paste.
    2.  Apply the paste to the stain with an old toothbrush.
    3.  Gently scrub the area.
    4.  Rinse with clean water and blot dry.

### Restoring Suede Nap

If your suede feels stiff or flattened after cleaning:

1.  **Steam (very carefully):** Hold the affected suede area over a gentle steam source. A clothes steamer or boiling kettle (at a safe distance) works. Do not let it get too wet. The steam helps open the fibers.
2.  **Brush vigorously:** Immediately after steaming, use your suede brush. Brush back and forth vigorously to lift the nap. This restores the suede's soft, fuzzy texture.
3.  **Allow to dry:** Let the suede air dry completely. Then, brush it again if needed.

These advanced methods can revive your New Balance 990s. They help with marks that typical cleaning might miss. Remember to always be patient and gentle.
