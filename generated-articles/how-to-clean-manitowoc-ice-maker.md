Sanitizing is the final crucial step after descaling your Manitowoc ice maker. Descaling removes mineral buildup. Sanitizing kills any remaining bacteria, mold, or algae. This ensures the ice your machine produces is safe and clean for consumption. Do not skip this step.

Use an ice machine sanitizer specifically approved for food-contact surfaces. Manitowoc recommends its own brand of sanitizer. Mix the sanitizer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use a clean bucket for mixing. Never mix sanitizer with cleaner. This can create harmful fumes or reduce effectiveness.

Once the descaling process is complete and the machine is thoroughly rinsed, it is time to sanitize. Pour the mixed sanitizing solution into the machine's water trough. Some Manitowoc models have a dedicated sanitize cycle. If yours does, activate it. This cycle will circulate the sanitizer throughout the water system. It reaches all internal components that come into contact with water.

For parts you removed, submerge them in the sanitizing solution. Let them soak for the recommended time. Use a clean cloth dampened with sanitizer to wipe down the inside of the ice bin. Ensure all surfaces are covered. This includes the inside walls, bottom, and any removable liners.

After the sanitizing cycle or soaking time, drain the machine. There is no need to rinse after sanitizing. The sanitizer is designed to dry on surfaces without leaving harmful residue. It will evaporate, leaving behind a sterile environment. Reassemble all components. Ensure they are correctly positioned. This completes the cleaning and sanitizing process. Your Manitowoc ice maker is now ready to produce fresh, safe ice. Regular sanitization prevents unpleasant odors and keeps your ice pure. If you are ever dealing with [mold in a portable ice maker](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-portable-ice-maker), many of the sanitizing principles apply there too.
