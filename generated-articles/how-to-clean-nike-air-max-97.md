### Clear and Concise Answer

To clean Nike Air Max 97 shoes, first remove laces and insoles. Brush off loose dirt. Use a mild cleaning solution with a soft brush or cloth to scrub uppers and midsoles. For mesh, use gentle strokes. Rinse with a damp cloth. Air dry away from direct heat.

## Understanding Your Nike Air Max 97 Materials

The Nike Air Max 97 has a distinct look. It uses several different materials. Knowing these materials helps you clean your shoes correctly. Each material needs a specific cleaning approach.

Most Air Max 97 uppers feature a mix of synthetic leather and mesh. The synthetic leather gives the shoe its wavy lines. It is quite durable. The mesh sections allow the shoe to breathe. These are often found near the tongue and side panels.

The sole unit consists of a foam midsole and a rubber outsole. The full-length Air unit is visible within the midsole. Reflective strips are another key feature of the Air Max 97. These strips appear on the wavy lines. You must clean these areas with care.

Different colors of Air Max 97 shoes can affect cleaning. White Air Max 97s show dirt more easily. They may need more frequent and gentle cleaning. Darker colors hide dirt better, but still require regular care. Understanding these materials prevents damage during cleaning. You will protect the shoe's structure and appearance.

## Essential Tools for Cleaning Air Max 97

Having the right tools makes cleaning your Air Max 97s much easier. You do not need many special items. Most of these things you might already have at home. Using the correct tools prevents damage to the shoe's materials.

First, you need a few types of brushes. A soft-bristle brush is good for the mesh and delicate areas. An old toothbrush works well here. For tougher spots like the sole, a medium-bristle brush is better. Some people use specialized shoe cleaning brushes.

Next, you will need cleaning solutions. A mild soap and water mixture is a good start. Dish soap works well. You can also buy specific sneaker cleaning solutions. These are often designed to be safe for various shoe materials. I find that a gentle solution is always the best choice.

You also need clean microfiber cloths. These are soft and absorbent. They help wipe away dirt and excess solution. A small bowl for mixing your solution is useful. Cotton swabs can help clean small, tight spaces. Finally, a shoe tree or crumpled paper keeps the shoe's shape during drying. This prevents creases.

## Basic Steps to Clean Nike Air Max 97 Regularly

Regular cleaning keeps your Nike Air Max 97s looking good. It stops dirt from building up. This prevents stubborn stains later on. I make it a habit to clean my shoes after a few wears. This simple routine extends their life significantly.

Start by removing the shoelaces and insoles. This allows you to clean these parts separately. It also helps you reach all areas of the shoe. Laces can go into a small bowl with soap and water to soak. You can scrub them with a brush.

Next, remove loose dirt from the shoes. Take them outside and tap them together. Use a dry, soft-bristle brush to brush off any dry mud or dust. Make sure to get into the grooves of the outsole. This prepares the shoe for wet cleaning. It prevents mud from turning into a muddy mess.

Now, prepare your cleaning solution. Mix a small amount of mild soap with warm water in a bowl. Dip your soft-bristle brush into the solution. Gently scrub the mesh and synthetic leather parts of the shoe. Work in small circular motions. Do not press too hard. Wipe away excess foam with a clean, damp cloth. Repeat this process until the surfaces look clean. This method works well for general upkeep.

## Deep Cleaning Stubborn Stains on Your Air Max 97

Sometimes your Air Max 97s pick up more than just light dirt. Stubborn stains need a more focused approach. Mud, grass stains, or scuffs can be challenging. Do not worry; you can still get your shoes clean.

For dried mud, let it dry completely. Then, use a stiff brush to scrape off as much as possible. This step is important before you add any liquid. Adding water to wet mud often spreads the stain. After brushing, you can proceed with your cleaning solution.

For scuffs on the synthetic leather, a magic eraser can work wonders. Dampen the magic eraser slightly. Gently rub the scuff marks. Test this on a small, hidden area first. This ensures it does not harm the material. Be gentle; too much pressure can remove the finish.

Yellowing on white midsoles is a common problem. For this, you can create a paste of baking soda and a small amount of water. Apply the paste to the yellowed areas. Let it sit for about 15-20 minutes. Then, scrub with a medium-bristle brush. Rinse with a damp cloth. This can help whiten the sole. This technique is similar to what I use when I [clean white Nike Air Max 270](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-nike-air-max-270) shoes. For deeper yellowing, some people use specialized sole cleaning products. These products often contain oxidizers. Always follow the product instructions carefully.

## Specific Care for Air Max 97 Components

The Nike Air Max 97 has different parts. Each part needs slightly different attention. Focusing on these specific areas helps you achieve a full clean. This also prevents damage to delicate parts.

**Cleaning the Mesh:** The mesh areas on Air Max 97s are breathable but can trap dirt. Use a soft-bristle brush and a mild cleaning solution. Gently scrub the mesh in one direction. Avoid rubbing too hard, as this can damage the mesh fibers. Rinse the brush often to keep it clean. For advice on specific mesh shoes, you can also learn [how to clean Nike mesh shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-nike-mesh-shoes). After scrubbing, wipe the mesh with a clean, damp cloth. This removes all soap residue.

**Caring for the Air Unit and Soles:** The visible Air unit is made of clear plastic. You can wipe it with a damp cloth and mild soap. The rubber outsole collects a lot of dirt. Use a medium-bristle brush to scrub the grooves. A stiffer brush might be needed for very tough dirt. The foam midsole can also get dirty. Use your soft brush and cleaning solution on this part. Pay extra attention to the wavy sections.

**Laces and Insoles:** These parts collect sweat and dirt. Wash laces separately in a bowl of soapy water. You can hand wash them or put them in a mesh laundry bag. This protects them in the washing machine. For insoles, wipe them down with a damp cloth and mild soap. Allow them to air dry completely before putting them back in the shoes. This helps prevent odors. Some people sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes and on insoles to absorb smells.

**Reflective Strips:** The Air Max 97 is famous for its reflective strips. Be careful when cleaning these. Harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbing can damage the reflective coating. Use only a soft cloth and mild soap and water. Gently wipe the strips. Avoid using brushes with stiff bristles directly on them. Proper care keeps these iconic details shining.

## Drying and Protecting Your Clean Air Max 97

After cleaning your Air Max 97s, proper drying is important. Incorrect drying can damage the shoe materials. It can also cause unpleasant smells or misshaping. Protecting your shoes after they dry helps keep them clean longer.

Never put your Air Max 97s in a washing machine or tumble dryer. The high heat can shrink or melt materials. It can also damage the Air unit. This includes shoes like the [Nike Vapormax](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-nike-vapormax), which also rely on air cushioning. Air drying is the only safe method.

Find a cool, dry place indoors. Keep the shoes away from direct sunlight or heaters. Direct heat can cause materials to warp or yellow. Open up the shoes as much as possible. You can unlace them completely. Stuff them with clean paper towels or newspaper. This helps absorb moisture from the inside. It also helps the shoes keep their shape. Change the paper every few hours if it becomes very damp.

Allow your shoes to air dry for at least 24-48 hours. Make sure they are completely dry before you wear them again. Moisture trapped inside can lead to mildew and bad odors. Once dry, consider applying a shoe protector spray. These sprays create a barrier against water and stains. They are like an invisible shield for your shoes. Follow the product instructions for best results. Reapply the spray every few months, especially if you wear the shoes often. This simple step keeps them cleaner between washes.

## Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Air Max 97

Cleaning your Nike Air Max 97s can be easy. However, some common mistakes can damage your shoes. Avoiding these errors ensures your sneakers stay in top condition. I learned some of these the hard way, so you don't have to.

One big mistake is using harsh chemicals. Bleach, strong detergents, or abrasive cleaners can ruin shoe materials. They can strip color, dry out synthetic leather, or dissolve adhesives. Stick to mild soaps or specialized sneaker cleaning solutions. Always test any new product on a small, hidden spot first. This helps prevent widespread damage.

Another error is scrubbing too hard. Aggressive scrubbing can damage mesh, scratch synthetic leather, or wear down reflective strips. Use gentle pressure. Let the cleaning solution do most of the work. For stubborn stains, repeat gentle scrubbing rather than pressing harder. Patience is key when cleaning.

Putting shoes in the washing machine is a common mistake. The machine's agitation and heat can damage the structure and materials of your Air Max 97s. The Air unit can also burst. Always hand wash these shoes. Avoid submerging them completely in water. Too much water can weaken glues and cause the shoe to fall apart.

Finally, never dry your shoes with direct heat. As discussed, this includes dryers, radiators, or direct sunlight. High heat can shrink, crack, or yellow shoe materials. It can also damage the Air Max cushioning. Air dry your shoes at room temperature. This takes longer, but it protects your investment. Following these simple "don't" rules helps keep your Air Max 97s looking new for a long time.
