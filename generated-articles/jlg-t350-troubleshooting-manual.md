## Understanding JLG T350 System Components

Your JLG T350 boom lift is a powerful machine. It uses several systems to operate safely and effectively. Knowing these systems helps you troubleshoot problems. The main systems include the engine, hydraulics, and electrical components.

The engine provides power. It turns fuel into mechanical energy. This energy drives the hydraulic pump and the electrical generator. A well-maintained engine runs smoothly. It is the heart of your JLG T350.

The hydraulic system lifts and moves the boom. It uses fluid under pressure. Pumps, valves, and cylinders work together. They make the boom extend, retract, and rotate. Fluid levels and clean filters are important for this system.

The electrical system controls everything. It powers the lights, gauges, and safety features. Wires, sensors, and the battery are key parts. The electrical system sends signals to the hydraulic valves. This ensures smooth and safe operation of the JLG T350.

### Engine Functionality and Fuel System

The engine needs fuel and air to run. Check the fuel level first when troubleshooting starting issues. Make sure the fuel is clean and free of water. A dirty fuel filter can block fuel flow. This prevents the engine from starting or running well.

Air filters also need regular checks. A clogged air filter restricts air intake. This makes the engine lose power. It can also cause the engine to produce black smoke. Clean air is vital for engine combustion.

The engine also has an ignition system. Spark plugs ignite the fuel-air mixture. Worn spark plugs cause misfires or no start. Check spark plug condition if the engine turns over but does not catch. The starter motor must also engage correctly.

### Hydraulic System Principles

The hydraulic system uses fluid to transmit power. The fluid moves from a reservoir through a pump. The pump creates high pressure. This pressurized fluid then flows through hoses and valves. It reaches the hydraulic cylinders.

These cylinders extend or retract to move the boom sections. Leaks in hoses or seals reduce pressure. This causes slow operation or loss of power. Always check for visible leaks around hydraulic components. A low fluid level also affects performance.

The hydraulic system also uses filters. These filters remove contaminants from the fluid. Dirty filters restrict fluid flow. This can overheat the system or damage components. Regularly replace hydraulic filters.

### Electrical System Basics

The electrical system starts with the battery. The battery provides power for starting the engine. It also powers the control panel and safety sensors. Check battery terminals for corrosion. Ensure the battery has a full charge.

Fuses protect electrical circuits. A blown fuse means an electrical overload. Check the fuse box if a specific function stops working. Replace blown fuses with the correct type. Always diagnose the cause of the blown fuse.

Sensors and switches monitor machine conditions. They send signals to the control unit. A faulty sensor can cause an error code. It can also prevent a function from working. Diagnostics tools help identify which sensor is faulty.

## Troubleshooting Engine and Power System Issues

Engine problems can stop your JLG T350 immediately. A common issue is the engine not starting. First, check the basics. Ensure the fuel tank is full. Verify the battery has enough charge. A weak battery struggles to crank the engine.

Sometimes the engine cranks but does not start. This points to fuel or ignition problems. Check the fuel filter for clogs. Make sure fresh fuel flows to the engine. Inspect the spark plugs or glow plugs. These components are vital for ignition.

Loss of power during operation is another issue. This often relates to restricted air or fuel flow. Examine the air filter for dirt. Change it if it looks clogged. Check fuel filters again for any blockages. The engine needs a proper fuel-air mix to run efficiently.

### Engine Cranks but Won't Start

If your JLG T350 engine turns over but fails to ignite, start with the fuel supply. Check the fuel lines for kinks or damage. Ensure the fuel pump is working. You should hear it prime when you turn the key. A simple test is to loosen a fuel line at the engine and check for fuel flow.

Next, consider the ignition system. For gasoline engines, check spark plug wires and the distributor cap. For diesel engines, verify the glow plug system works. Glow plugs warm the combustion chamber for easier starting in cold weather. A quick check involves looking for power at the glow plugs when activated.

Finally, confirm proper air intake. A severely clogged air filter can starve the engine of air. This prevents combustion. Remove the air filter and attempt to start the engine briefly. If it starts, the filter is the problem.

### Engine Loses Power or Stalls

When your JLG T350 engine loses power or stalls, it signals an underlying issue. Start by checking the fuel system for clogs. A partially blocked fuel filter can reduce fuel flow under load. This causes power loss. Check the fuel quality too. Water or contaminants in the fuel can disrupt engine performance.

Inspect the air intake system. A dirty air filter restricts airflow to the engine. This makes the engine work harder and lose power. Regularly clean or replace the air filter. Also, check for any obstructions in the air intake hose.

Overheating can also cause power loss or stalling. Check the coolant level and radiator for debris. Ensure the cooling fan works. An engine that runs too hot will lose efficiency. It can also shut down to prevent damage.

## Diagnosing Hydraulic System Malfunctions

The hydraulic system is crucial for your JLG T350's movements. Issues here mean the boom may not lift, extend, or rotate correctly. A common sign is slow operation or no movement at all. Always check the hydraulic fluid level first. Low fluid causes many problems.

Fluid leaks are a major concern. Look for oil stains on the ground or wet spots on hoses and cylinders. A small leak can quickly lead to low pressure. This reduces the lift's capacity or speed. Address leaks promptly to avoid further damage.

Unusual noises, like whining or grinding, can also signal hydraulic trouble. This might indicate air in the system or a failing pump. Air in the hydraulic lines makes the system spongy. It reduces its effectiveness.

### Boom Won't Lift or Extend

If your JLG T350 boom does not lift or extend, several issues could be at play. First, check the hydraulic fluid level. A low fluid level means the pump cannot build enough pressure. This prevents movement. Top off the fluid if it is low.

Next, inspect the hydraulic pump. If the pump fails, no fluid moves. Listen for the pump working when you try to activate a function. A silent pump might indicate an electrical issue. Check its power supply.

Valves also control fluid flow. A stuck or faulty valve can block fluid from reaching the cylinders. Some valves are solenoid-operated. Test their electrical connections. A professional might need to check internal valve components.

### Slow or Jerky Operations

Slow or jerky hydraulic operations on your JLG T350 are frustrating. This often points to insufficient hydraulic pressure or flow. Begin by checking the hydraulic filters. Clogged filters restrict fluid movement. This makes the system sluggish. Replacing them can often resolve the issue.

Air trapped in the hydraulic system can also cause jerky movements. Air bubbles compress differently than fluid. This leads to erratic operation. The system needs to be bled to remove air. Consult your JLG T350 manual for the correct bleeding procedure.

A worn hydraulic pump can also be the cause. An old pump may not generate enough pressure or flow. This leads to slow responses. You might hear a whining noise if the pump is failing. Pump replacement may be necessary in severe cases.

## Troubleshooting Electrical System and Controls

The electrical system is the nervous system of your JLG T350. It powers controls, sensors, and safety features. When electrical issues arise, functions may stop working or error codes appear. Start by checking the battery. A low battery charge affects everything.

Inspect all electrical connections. Loose or corroded terminals can interrupt power flow. Clean any corrosion you find. Ensure all cables are securely fastened. This includes battery cables and control wiring.

Fuses protect circuits from overcurrent. A blown fuse means the circuit is overloaded or shorted. Locate the fuse box. Check all fuses related to the non-working function. Always replace a blown fuse with one of the same amperage.

### No Power to Controls or Lift Won't Turn On

If your JLG T350 shows no power to the controls or refuses to turn on, start with the main power source. Check the battery's voltage. A fully charged 12V battery should read around 12.6 volts. If the voltage is too low, the system will not engage. Recharge or replace the battery.

Inspect the main battery cables. Look for loose connections at the battery terminals or the starter. Corrosion on these terminals can prevent current flow. Clean them thoroughly with a wire brush. A good connection ensures proper power delivery.

Also, check the main circuit breaker or master fuse. These protect the entire electrical system. If tripped or blown, reset or replace them. Some JLG models have an emergency stop button that cuts all power. Ensure it is not engaged.

### Error Codes and Sensor Malfunctions

Modern JLG T350 lifts use error codes to identify problems. When an error code appears on the display, it points to a specific system fault. Consult your JLG T350 operator's manual for a list of these codes. The manual explains what each code means. It also suggests initial troubleshooting steps.

Many error codes relate to sensor malfunctions. Sensors monitor various aspects like boom position, pressure, or engine temperature. A faulty sensor sends incorrect data. This triggers an error code. Check the sensor's wiring for damage or loose connections.

Sometimes the error is simply a dirty sensor. Clean off any debris or buildup. If the sensor is physically damaged, it needs replacement. Proper sensor function is vital for safe and accurate lift operation.

## Addressing Lift Mechanism and Platform Issues

Problems with the JLG T350's lift mechanism or platform affect stability and reach. These issues can include the boom not extending fully or the platform not leveling. They often stem from hydraulic or sensor problems. Inspect the physical components for damage.

The boom extension system relies on cables and hydraulic cylinders. Check these cables for fraying or tension issues. Ensure the cylinders extend and retract smoothly. Any binding or resistance indicates a problem.

Platform leveling systems use sensors to keep the platform flat. If the platform tilts, these sensors might be out of calibration or faulty. Overload sensors also prevent lifting too much weight. Ensure no excessive weight is on the platform.

### Boom Not Extending/Retracting Properly

When the JLG T350 boom does not extend or retract smoothly, several factors could be involved. First, check the hydraulic cylinders responsible for extension and retraction. Look for visible leaks or damage on the cylinder rods. Leaking seals reduce the cylinder's ability to hold pressure, leading to sluggish movement.

Next, inspect the extension and retraction cables. These cables guide the boom sections. Frayed, loose, or broken cables can cause binding or uneven extension. Adjust or replace them as needed. Proper tension is crucial for smooth operation.

Also, consider debris or damage within the boom sections. Dirt or foreign objects can obstruct the smooth sliding of sections. Clean the boom sections thoroughly. Lubricate the wear pads and sliding surfaces. This ensures friction-free movement.

### Platform Leveling Problems

Platform leveling is critical for safety on the JLG T350. If the platform is not level, it can cause instability. Check the leveling sensors first. These sensors detect the platform's tilt and send signals to the control system. They may need calibration if the platform is consistently off.

The platform leveling system often uses hydraulic cylinders and valves. Inspect these components for proper function. A faulty valve might not direct fluid correctly. This causes one side of the platform to drop. Check for any leaks in these specific hydraulic lines.

Lastly, inspect the physical structure of the platform and its mounting points. Damage or excessive wear in these areas can affect leveling. Ensure all pins and bushings are secure. Regular inspection helps prevent these issues.

## Safety System Diagnostics and Alarms

Safety is paramount when operating a JLG T350. The machine has multiple safety systems to protect the operator and nearby personnel. These include emergency stop buttons, interlocks, and alarm systems. When a safety system detects an issue, it often prevents operation or triggers an alarm.

Emergency stop buttons immediately cut power to all functions. Ensure they are not pressed in when trying to operate the machine. Test them regularly to confirm they work. They are a critical safety feature.

Interlocks prevent operation if certain conditions are not met. For example, some lifts won't operate if outriggers are not deployed or if the platform gate is open. Check all interlock switches. Ensure they are clean and not damaged.

Alarms signal a warning or fault. A constant beeping or flashing light means something is wrong. Refer to your JLG T350 troubleshooting manual for alarm codes. Addressing alarm conditions quickly prevents further problems.

### Emergency Stop and Interlock Issues

If your JLG T350 won't move after you hit the emergency stop, check the button first. Ensure it is fully released. Many emergency stops require pulling or twisting to reset them. If it remains engaged, it will cut all power.

Interlock switches ensure safe operation. These switches prevent functions if specific conditions are not met. For example, the ground control station might have an interlock. It ensures the platform control is not active. Check the state of all interlock switches.

Common interlocks include gate switches, outrigger sensors, and tilt sensors. If a gate is not fully closed, the lift might not operate. If an outrigger is not fully extended, it prevents boom movement. Inspect these switches for damage or dirt.

### Overload and Tilt Alarms

Overload alarms sound when the JLG T350 detects too much weight on the platform. Immediately reduce the load if this alarm activates. Do not try to override it. This alarm prevents tipping and structural damage. Check the load cell sensor for damage or calibration issues if the alarm sounds without an actual overload.

Tilt alarms warn if the machine is on too steep a slope. This alarm triggers for safety reasons, preventing tip-overs. Move the JLG T350 to level ground if this alarm activates. Check the tilt sensor for debris or damage. Ensure the ground is firm and flat before operation.

Both overload and tilt alarms are critical safety features. They prevent serious accidents. Never ignore these alarms. Always address the underlying condition before continuing operation. These alarms save lives and prevent machine damage.
