## Achieving Your Ideal Shower Height: How To Make Shower Head Higher

Have you ever stepped into your shower only to find the water stream hitting you around the chest? It is a common problem, especially for taller individuals or when family members have different height needs. A shower that is too low can turn a relaxing experience into an awkward crouch. You deserve a shower setup that fits you perfectly.

This article explores several effective methods to make shower head higher. We will cover simple, quick fixes like extensions, as well as more involved plumbing changes. You will learn about adjustable sliding bars, rain shower conversions, and even full custom solutions. By the end, you will understand how to choose the right option for your bathroom and enjoy a more comfortable shower experience. Let's get started on elevating your daily routine.

### Takeaway

*   **Assess your current setup:** Measure existing height and identify your shower head type.
*   **Opt for easy fixes first:** Consider shower arm extensions or adjustable brackets for quick results.

Making your shower head higher is often a straightforward process. You can achieve this by adding a simple shower arm extension, installing a versatile sliding bar, or completely replacing your existing shower arm with an S-shaped or high-arc option. More permanent solutions involve professional plumbing modifications or converting to a ceiling-mounted system.

## Understanding Your Current Shower Setup

Before you make shower head higher, you need to understand your current setup. This initial assessment helps you choose the best and most practical solution. You should consider the existing height, the type of shower head, and your bathroom's overall design. Knowing these details prevents unforeseen issues during the upgrade process.

Start by measuring the current shower head height from the shower floor or tub base. This measurement gives you a baseline. Consider who uses the shower and their individual height requirements. A good rule of thumb is to position the shower head about 6 to 12 inches above the tallest userâ€™s head. This ensures a comfortable and enveloping spray.

Next, identify your shower head type. Most homes have a fixed wall-mounted shower head. Some may already have a handheld shower head with a fixed bracket. Knowing your current type helps you determine what new parts are compatible. This initial review sets the stage for a successful height adjustment.

### Measuring for Ideal Height

Getting the right height makes a big difference in comfort. Stand in your shower and mark the spot where you want the water to hit your body. For most people, this is above their head, allowing the water to fully envelop them. If multiple people use the shower, aim for a height that accommodates the tallest person.

Standard shower head height is often around 72-84 inches from the shower floor. However, this varies greatly based on building codes and personal preference. Tall individuals often need a height closer to 90-96 inches. Taking accurate measurements avoids repeated adjustments later.

Consider the spray pattern of your current shower head. A rain shower head, for example, often feels better mounted higher to allow for a broader, softer coverage. Knowing your desired spray also influences the ideal mounting height. This careful planning ensures you select the right method to increase the height.

### Types of Shower Heads and Arms

Different shower head and arm types offer varying degrees of flexibility for height adjustment. A standard shower arm extends straight out from the wall. This type is common and relatively easy to modify. Its simplicity makes it a good candidate for many height-increasing solutions.

Handheld shower heads connect to a hose and often include a wall-mounted bracket. While the bracket itself might be fixed, you can move the handheld spray. This offers immediate flexibility without needing major changes. Some brackets are adjustable, allowing you to slide the handheld shower up and down.

Rain shower heads are typically larger and designed for an overhead spray. They often require a longer shower arm or a ceiling mount. This type delivers a luxurious experience. Understanding these types helps you pick the best upgrade. Knowing your current setup simplifies the selection process for elevating your shower experience.

## The Easiest Fixes: Adjustable Shower Arms and Extenders

If you need to make your shower head higher without major plumbing work, adjustable shower arms and extenders are your best friends. These products are designed for quick installation. They offer a simple way to gain several inches of height, greatly improving comfort. Many people find these solutions provide enough extra reach.

Shower arm extenders screw directly onto your existing shower arm. Your shower head then attaches to the extender. These devices come in various lengths and designs, allowing you to choose how much extra height you need. They are usually made of metal, ensuring durability. Installation is straightforward and requires minimal tools.

Adjustable shower arms replace your existing fixed arm. They feature a pivot point or a movable joint. This allows you to raise or lower the shower head manually after installation. These arms offer more flexibility than simple extenders. They are perfect for households with users of different heights.

### Installing a Shower Arm Extender

Installing a shower arm extender is one of the simplest ways to make shower head higher. You only need a few basic tools: an adjustable wrench, plumbing tape (Teflon tape), and a cloth. The process takes only a few minutes, even for a beginner. This is a very budget-friendly option.

First, remove your current shower head from the existing shower arm. Turn it counter-clockwise by hand or with a wrench if it is tight. Make sure to protect the finish of your shower head if using a wrench. You will see the threaded end of the shower arm.

Next, wrap plumbing tape around the threads of the existing shower arm. This creates a watertight seal and prevents leaks. Wrap it clockwise several times. Then, screw the shower arm extender onto the existing arm. Tighten it by hand, then use the wrench for a final snug turn. Do not overtighten, as this can strip the threads.

Finally, wrap plumbing tape around the threads of the extender's new end. Screw your shower head onto this end. Tighten by hand, then use the wrench for a final turn. Turn on the water and check for leaks. If you find any, tighten slightly more. Your shower head is now higher, making your shower more enjoyable.

### Using an Adjustable Shower Arm

An adjustable shower arm provides more dynamic control over your shower head height. This type of arm usually has an elbow joint or a series of adjustable pivots. You can move the shower head up, down, or even out, depending on the design. This flexibility is great for multi-user bathrooms.

To install an adjustable shower arm, you first remove your existing shower head and then the old shower arm. Shower arms usually screw into a fitting inside the wall. You might need a sturdy wrench or pipe wrench for this step. Be careful not to damage the wall pipe. Clean any old sealant or tape from the wall fitting.

Wrap plumbing tape around the threads of the new adjustable shower arm. Screw the new arm into the wall fitting. Tighten it firmly, but again, avoid overtightening. The arm should feel secure and stable. Make sure the arm's pivot mechanism is facing the correct direction.

Finally, attach your shower head to the adjustable arm, using plumbing tape on the threads. Test the arm's adjustment mechanism. Adjust the height and angle to your preference. Check for leaks at all connection points. This upgrade gives you fantastic control over your shower's spray position.

## Upgrading for Height: Sliding Bar Shower Heads

A sliding bar shower head system is an excellent solution for versatile height adjustment. This setup includes a wall-mounted bar with a movable bracket. You can slide your handheld shower head up or down along this bar. This provides immense flexibility, making it perfect for families with varying heights or for tasks like washing pets.

This type of system replaces your fixed shower head. It offers both the convenience of a handheld spray and the adjustability of a fixed shower head. The bar itself is typically chrome or brushed nickel, matching most bathroom decors. Installation requires drilling into your shower wall, so planning is essential.

Choosing a sliding bar also allows you to keep the existing water supply line in the wall. You simply connect the hose from the handheld shower head to the existing shower arm. This minimizes complex plumbing work. It creates a highly adaptable showering environment.

### Installing a Sliding Bar

Installing a sliding bar system requires accurate measurements and careful drilling. Most kits come with all necessary hardware. You will need a drill, drill bits suitable for your wall material (tile, fiberglass), a level, a pencil, and a screwdriver. Proper installation ensures the bar remains stable.

First, decide on the desired height range for your sliding bar. Hold the bar against the wall and mark the top and bottom mounting points. Use a level to ensure the marks are perfectly vertical. Accuracy here is crucial for a straight installation. Double-check your measurements before proceeding.

Next, drill pilot holes at your marked points. Use the appropriate drill bit for your wall material. If drilling into tile, use a specialized tile bit and proceed slowly to avoid cracking the tile. Insert wall anchors into the drilled holes if your kit includes them. These anchors provide a secure base for the screws.

Finally, position the sliding bar over the holes and secure it with the provided screws. Make sure it is firmly attached to the wall. Connect the handheld shower hose to your existing shower arm or a diverter valve. Place the handheld shower head in the adjustable bracket. Test the slide mechanism and check for leaks.

### Benefits of a Sliding Bar System

A sliding bar shower head system offers several distinct advantages. Its primary benefit is unmatched height flexibility. You can effortlessly adjust the shower head position for children, adults, or even for specific tasks. This adaptability makes daily routines much simpler.

The system also combines the convenience of a handheld shower with the function of a fixed one. You can detach the shower head for focused cleaning or bathing. When you need a hands-free experience, just slide it into the desired position on the bar. This dual functionality is highly practical.

Furthermore, a sliding bar system often enhances accessibility for people with mobility issues. It allows them to position the shower head lower for seated showering. This makes it a great choice for universal design bathrooms. Investing in a sliding bar system greatly improves the functionality and comfort of your shower.

## The Bold Move: Ceiling-Mounted and Rain Shower Heads

For the ultimate in height and luxury, consider a ceiling-mounted or rain shower head. This option provides a fixed, overhead spray that mimics rainfall. It is perfect for those seeking a spa-like experience and significant height increase. This solution typically involves more extensive plumbing work.

Ceiling-mounted shower heads are installed directly into your ceiling. A pipe runs from your water supply through the ceiling to the shower head. This creates a sleek, minimalist look in your shower. It also ensures the shower head is well above even the tallest individuals.

Rain shower heads often come in large, square or round designs. They deliver a wide, gentle spray. While some can be wall-mounted with a long shower arm, true rain shower experiences often benefit from ceiling installation. This provides the ideal distance for the "rainfall" effect.

### Installing a Ceiling-Mounted Rain Shower

Installing a ceiling-mounted rain shower head is a major project. It typically requires opening up your ceiling and possibly your wall to run new plumbing. This is often best left to a professional plumber. However, understanding the process is useful if you plan this upgrade. This type of installation makes shower head higher in the most dramatic way.

First, your plumber will need to locate the existing water supply lines. They will then extend a new pipe from these lines up into the ceiling. This new pipe will terminate at the desired location for your rain shower head. Proper planning ensures the pipe aligns with your shower design.

Next, the plumber will install a shower arm or drop-down pipe from the ceiling. This pipe connects to the new water line and extends down to the exact height where you want your rain shower head. They will secure this pipe to the ceiling joists for stability. This step ensures the shower head is firmly in place.

Finally, the rain shower head attaches to the ceiling drop-down pipe. All connections will be sealed and tested for leaks. The ceiling will then be repaired and finished. This comprehensive approach provides a truly high and luxurious showering experience. If you are looking to [add a rain shower head to an existing shower](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-add-rain-shower-head-to-existing-shower), this involves similar steps but may integrate with current wall plumbing.

### Pros and Cons of Ceiling Mounts

Ceiling-mounted shower heads offer significant advantages. The primary benefit is the dramatic increase in shower height. This provides ample space for even the tallest users. The overhead spray creates a luxurious and immersive experience. It truly feels like standing in the rain.

Aesthetically, ceiling mounts offer a clean and modern look. The plumbing is hidden within the ceiling, giving your shower a minimalist design. This contributes to a high-end bathroom feel. It can also increase your home's value and appeal.

However, there are cons to consider. Installation is complex and often expensive. It involves significant demolition and plumbing work, usually requiring a professional. This means more time and cost compared to simpler solutions. Repairing leaks or making future changes can also be more difficult due to hidden plumbing. Despite the investment, the comfort and style benefits are often worth it for many homeowners.

## Custom Solutions: Plumbing Modifications and Riser Pipes

Sometimes, off-the-shelf solutions are not enough to make shower head higher. For significant height increases or specific design needs, plumbing modifications are necessary. These custom solutions involve altering the existing water supply lines within your wall. This often means hiring a professional plumber.

One common plumbing modification is extending the shower arm's wall connection. Instead of just adding an extender, the actual pipe coming out of the wall is moved higher. This creates a permanent and integrated height increase. It requires opening up the shower wall to access the plumbing.

Another option is installing a shower riser pipe. This is a vertical pipe that extends upwards from your existing shower arm connection point. The shower head then attaches to the top of the riser. Riser pipes can be concealed within the wall for a sleek look or exposed for a vintage, industrial style. These methods offer tailored height adjustments.

### Extending the Wall Pipe

Extending the wall pipe is a permanent way to make your shower head higher. This method involves cutting into your shower wall to access the existing water supply line. It is a more involved project than simply adding an extension. A professional plumber usually handles this task.

First, the plumber will remove tiles or cut into the shower wall to expose the shower arm's connection. They will then disconnect the old shower arm. Next, they will cut the existing pipe that feeds water to the shower arm. A new, longer piece of pipe is then soldered or connected into place. This new pipe extends upwards to the desired height.

Once the new pipe is at the correct height, a new drop-ear elbow or female adapter is securely attached. This fitting is then anchored to a wall stud for stability. It provides the strong connection point for the new, higher shower arm. This ensures the shower head will not wiggle or sag.

Finally, the new shower arm is screwed into the higher fitting, and the shower head is attached. The wall is then repaired, and new tiles are installed. This method creates a seamless and robust height increase. It ensures the plumbing is secure and hidden.

### Using a Shower Riser Pipe

A shower riser pipe offers another custom solution for increasing shower height. A riser is essentially an exposed vertical pipe that connects to your existing shower arm outlet. The shower head then mounts to the top of this riser. This can be a stylish option, especially in traditional or industrial-themed bathrooms.

Installation of a riser pipe involves securely mounting the vertical pipe to the wall. The bottom of the riser connects to the existing shower arm connection point. This might require a small adapter piece. The riser then extends vertically, allowing you to position the shower head significantly higher.

Riser pipes come in various finishes, like chrome, bronze, or black, to match your bathroom fixtures. Some risers include an integrated diverter for a handheld shower. This adds further versatility to your setup. This method provides a sturdy and visually appealing way to elevate your shower head.

While the riser itself is exposed, the connection points must be watertight. Use plumbing tape on all threaded connections to prevent leaks. Securely mounting the riser to wall studs is crucial for stability. This custom approach provides both height and a unique aesthetic. It makes your shower head higher while adding character.

## Handheld Showers and Adjustable Brackets

Handheld shower heads offer incredible versatility, and they can also help you make shower head higher. While typically used for targeted spraying or cleaning, many handheld systems include adjustable wall brackets. These brackets allow you to position the handheld shower head at various heights along a vertical track.

This solution provides the best of both worlds: the flexibility of a handheld shower and the hands-free convenience of a fixed shower head. You can set the height precisely where you need it for showering. Then, you can remove the shower head from the bracket to rinse specific areas or clean the shower itself.

Many new shower head kits come with both a fixed head and a handheld option on a diverter. If you already have a handheld, you might just need to upgrade its wall bracket. This is a simpler alternative to full plumbing modifications. It offers immediate functional improvement.

### Choosing an Adjustable Bracket

When selecting an adjustable bracket for your handheld shower, consider the type of mounting and the range of height adjustment. Some brackets simply pivot, allowing for angle changes. Others slide along a vertical bar, providing much greater height flexibility. Opt for the sliding bar type for maximum height adjustability.

Look for brackets made from durable materials like metal or high-quality ABS plastic. These materials resist corrosion and wear, ensuring your bracket lasts. The finish should match your existing shower fixtures for a cohesive look. Compatibility with your existing shower hose and head is also important.

Installation of an adjustable bracket varies. Some brackets use suction cups, which are the easiest but least secure option. Others use adhesive, which can work on smooth surfaces but might lose grip over time. The most secure brackets require drilling into the wall and using screws or anchors. This provides a stable and long-lasting hold.

Measure your desired height range carefully before mounting the bracket. Mark your drill points precisely. Use a level to ensure the bar is perfectly vertical. A securely mounted adjustable bracket will provide years of reliable use, allowing you to easily control your shower head height.

### Integrating a Handheld Shower System

If you do not already have a handheld shower, integrating a full system can significantly enhance your shower's versatility. This typically involves replacing your existing fixed shower head with a diverter valve that allows you to switch between the fixed head and the handheld. This also involves an additional hose.

First, you remove your old fixed shower head. Then, you install a diverter valve onto the existing shower arm. This valve has two outlets: one for your original fixed shower head (or a new one) and one for the handheld shower hose. Ensure all connections are sealed with plumbing tape to prevent leaks.

Next, you connect your new handheld shower hose to the diverter valve. The other end of the hose attaches to the handheld shower head. You will then mount the sliding bar or adjustable bracket to the wall at your desired height. Remember to drill pilot holes and use wall anchors for secure mounting.

Finally, place the handheld shower head into its bracket. Test the diverter valve to ensure water flows correctly to both the fixed and handheld heads. Check all connections for leaks. This integrated system offers supreme flexibility, allowing you to easily make shower head higher or lower on demand.

## Before You Start: Safety and Tool Checklist

Before you begin any project to make your shower head higher, preparation is key. This includes gathering the right tools and understanding crucial safety measures. Proper preparation ensures the job goes smoothly, prevents damage, and keeps you safe. Skipping these steps can lead to frustration or costly mistakes.

Always turn off the main water supply to your house or, at minimum, to your bathroom. This prevents unexpected water flow and leaks during installation. Open a faucet in the bathroom to drain any remaining water from the pipes. This relieves pressure and avoids a messy surprise.

Wear appropriate safety gear, such as safety glasses, to protect your eyes from debris or splashing water. Use gloves to get a better grip and protect your hands. Have a bucket or towels ready to catch any residual water in the pipes. A well-lit workspace is also important for accuracy and safety.

### Essential Tools and Materials

*   **Adjustable Wrench or Pliers:** For tightening and loosening connections.
*   **Plumbing Tape (Teflon Tape):** Essential for creating watertight seals on threaded connections. Always wrap it clockwise.
*   **Rag or Old Towel:** To clean up any water spills and protect finishes.
*   **Bucket:** To catch any water when disconnecting pipes.
*   **Screwdriver (Phillips and Flathead):** For screws on brackets or cover plates.
*   **Drill and Drill Bits:** If installing a sliding bar or new wall bracket. Make sure you have the correct bit for your wall material (tile, fiberglass, drywall).
*   **Level:** To ensure new bars or brackets are installed straight.
*   **Pencil:** For marking drill points.
*   **Wall Anchors (if not included with product):** For secure mounting in drywall or weak spots.
*   **Safety Glasses and Gloves:** For personal protection.

Having these items ready before you start saves time and frustration. A little preparation goes a long way.

### Checking for Leaks and Maintenance

After you make shower head higher, thoroughly check for leaks. Turn on the water supply slowly and carefully. Observe all newly made connections. Look closely for drips or seeping water around the threads of the shower arm, extender, or bracket. Even a small drip can cause significant water damage over time.

If you find a leak, turn off the water supply immediately. Tighten the connection slightly more with your wrench. If the leak persists, you might need to re-apply plumbing tape. Unscrew the component, remove the old tape, and apply several fresh layers of tape clockwise before re-tightening. Sometimes, misaligned threads are the cause, requiring a complete re-assembly.

Regular maintenance ensures your higher shower head functions properly. Periodically check all connections for looseness. If you notice your shower head [how to fix a loose shower head](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-fix-a-loose-shower-head), it might just need a simple tightening.
