## Cleaning Your Rothy's: A Simple Guide to Fresh Footwear

Rothy's shoes are popular for their stylish design, comfortable fit, and commitment to sustainability. They craft these unique shoes from recycled plastic bottles. This special material makes them incredibly durable and famously machine washable. However, knowing how to clean Rothy's correctly is key to keeping them looking new and extending their lifespan. Improper cleaning can damage the knit or alter their shape.

You likely bought your Rothy's for their convenience and eco-friendly appeal. My goal here is to help you maintain them properly. I will guide you through the best methods for cleaning Rothy's, from daily care to tackling stubborn stains. We will cover everything: what supplies you need, step-by-step washing instructions, and proper drying techniques. Following these simple steps ensures your Rothy's stay fresh, vibrant, and ready for your next adventure.

### Takeaway:
*   Machine wash Rothy's in cold water on a delicate cycle.
*   Always use a mesh laundry bag to protect them.
*   Air dry away from direct heat to maintain shape.
*   Spot treat tough stains before washing.

To clean Rothy's, machine wash them in cold water on a delicate cycle with mild detergent. Place them in a mesh laundry bag. Air dry thoroughly away from direct heat or sunlight. Spot treat stains before washing. This method keeps your Rothy's fresh and preserves their unique knit material.

## Understanding Rothy's: The Unique Material and Why It Matters for Cleaning

Rothy's shoes are not just ordinary footwear; they are a marvel of sustainable engineering. They construct each pair primarily from recycled plastic water bottles. This material is spun into a fine, durable thread. This thread then gets knit into the seamless shape of the shoe. This innovative process gives Rothy's their signature flexible, breathable, and surprisingly sturdy quality.

The unique knit material is why Rothy's are machine washable. Unlike leather or suede, which can warp or crack when wet, Rothy's engineered fabric holds up well to water. Understanding this material is important for proper cleaning. It means you can clean them much like a piece of clothing, rather than typical shoes. The synthetic fibers are resistant to shrinking and stretching when cleaned correctly. This durability is a major advantage for busy individuals.

This recycled plastic knit also impacts how stains interact with the shoes. The material tends to be less absorbent than natural fibers like cotton. This can make some stains easier to lift. However, dirt and grime can get trapped within the knit structure. This requires a thorough wash rather than just a quick wipe. Knowing your shoe's material is always the first step in effective cleaning. It helps you choose the right methods and products.

I find this material fascinating because it combines comfort with responsibility. It also makes the cleaning process quite simple. You do not need harsh chemicals or complicated tools. Gentle care preserves the integrity of the knit. It also maintains the vibrant colors of your Rothy's shoes. This understanding forms the basis for all the cleaning tips I will share.

## Essential Supplies for Cleaning Rothy's Shoes Effectively

Before you begin to clean your Rothy's, gathering the right supplies makes the process smooth and effective. You do not need a lot of specialized equipment. Most items are likely already in your home. Having everything ready saves time and ensures a thorough clean. I always recommend preparing your space first.

First, you will need a mesh laundry bag. This is crucial for protecting your Rothy's during the washing cycle. It prevents them from getting tangled or knocking around inside the washing machine. This bag also helps keep the shoe's shape. It is a small investment that offers big protection.

Next, choose a mild detergent. Harsh chemicals can damage the recycled knit material over time. Look for a gentle liquid detergent, free from bleach or strong dyes. I often use a detergent designed for delicates or baby clothes. This ensures a gentle clean that preserves the fabric's integrity and color.

You might also want a soft-bristled brush or an old toothbrush. These are useful for pre-treating specific stains or scrubbing dirt off the soles. A small basin or bucket can also be helpful for hand washing or spot treating. Finally, have a clean towel ready for blotting any excess water.

*   **Mesh Laundry Bag**: Essential for machine washing protection.
*   **Mild Liquid Detergent**: Choose a gentle formula, no bleach.
*   **Soft-bristled Brush/Old Toothbrush**: For spot treatment and scrubbing.
*   **Small Basin/Bucket**: For hand washing or pre-soaking.
*   **Clean Towel**: For blotting.

These simple tools are all you need for effective Rothy's cleaning. Using the correct supplies is just as important as following the right steps. It helps maintain the quality and appearance of your favorite shoes. Remember, gentle care is best for these unique, eco-friendly shoes.

## The Best Way to Clean Rothy's: Machine Washing Made Easy

The standout feature of Rothy's is their machine washability. This makes cleaning Rothy's incredibly convenient. I personally love being able to toss them in the washer after a long day. This method is the most effective for a deep clean and refreshing your shoes. It is straightforward, but a few key steps ensure the best results.

First, prepare your Rothy's for the wash. Remove the insoles from your shoes. Wash the insoles separately or along with the shoes inside the same mesh bag. This ensures both parts get thoroughly cleaned. Shake off any loose dirt or debris from the shoes before placing them in the bag.

Next, place your Rothy's (and insoles) inside a mesh laundry bag. I cannot stress enough how important this step is. The bag protects the shoes from tangling with other clothes or banging against the washing machine drum. This keeps their shape intact and prevents damage to the delicate knit. You can learn more about general shoe care, including machine washing tips, by checking out guides on [how to clean shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes).

Then, set your washing machine to a cold water, delicate cycle. Cold water is important because hot water can potentially shrink the knit or fade colors. A delicate cycle ensures a gentle wash without harsh agitation. Add a small amount of mild liquid detergent. Do not use bleach or fabric softener, as these can harm the material. Once the cycle finishes, promptly remove your Rothy's from the machine. Do not leave them sitting in the wet drum. This machine washing method offers a deep clean that restores your Rothy's to a fresh state.

## Hand Washing Rothy's for Gentle Care and Spot Treatments

While machine washing is the primary method for cleaning Rothy's, there are times when hand washing is more appropriate. Perhaps you only have a small stain, or you prefer a gentler approach. Hand washing offers more control and can be effective for maintenance between deeper machine washes. It is also great for targeting specific dirty spots.

To hand wash your Rothy's, begin by removing the insoles, just as you would for machine washing. You can hand wash these separately as well. Next, fill a small basin or sink with cool water. Add a tiny amount of mild liquid detergent to the water. Swirl it around to create a gentle, sudsy solution. Avoid using too much soap, as it can be hard to rinse out thoroughly.

Take one Rothy's shoe and submerge it in the soapy water. Use a soft-bristled brush or an old toothbrush to gently scrub any dirty areas. Pay close attention to the soles and any visible stains on the knit fabric. Work the brush in small, circular motions. The goal is to lift the dirt without harshly rubbing the fabric. For the insoles, you can scrub them similarly or simply wipe them down with a damp cloth if they are not heavily soiled.

Once you have scrubbed all the dirty spots, rinse the shoe thoroughly under cool, running water. Ensure all soap residue is gone. Squeeze excess water gently from the shoe, but do not wring it forcefully. Wringing can distort the shoe's shape. Repeat the process for the second shoe. Hand washing is a great way to keep your Rothy's looking good without a full machine cycle.

## Removing Stubborn Stains from Your Rothy's Footwear

Even with regular cleaning, some stubborn stains might appear on your Rothy's. These require specific attention before or during your washing routine. Acting quickly on stains is always the best strategy. The longer a stain sits, the harder it becomes to remove. I have had success with various common blemishes on my own Rothy's.

For most common stains like dirt, mud, or food spills, a simple pre-treatment can work wonders. Before machine washing or hand washing, apply a small drop of mild liquid detergent directly onto the stain. Gently rub it in with your fingers or a soft-bristled brush. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the detergent to break down the stain. Then, proceed with either machine washing or hand washing as described earlier. The detergent acts as a pre-soak.

For oil-based stains, you might need a slightly different approach. These can include grease or certain cosmetic spills. First, try to blot away any excess oil with a clean paper towel. Do not rub, as this can spread the stain. Then, sprinkle a small amount of cornstarch or baking soda onto the oily spot. Let it sit for an hour or two. This powder will absorb some of the oil. Brush off the powder, then apply mild detergent and proceed with washing. This two-step process helps lift the oil.

If you encounter tougher, more set-in stains, repeated gentle treatments might be necessary. Avoid using harsh stain removers or bleach, as these can damage the recycled knit fibers or fade the color. Sometimes, a mix of a little white vinegar and water (diluted) can help with odors and mild discoloration. Always test any new solution on an inconspicuous spot first. Patience and gentle methods are key to successfully removing stubborn stains from your Rothy's.

## Proper Drying Techniques for Your Clean Rothy's

After washing your Rothy's, proper drying is just as important as the cleaning itself. Incorrect drying can lead to misshapen shoes, unpleasant odors, or even mildew. It is a critical step in maintaining the integrity and appearance of your Rothy's. I always make sure to give my Rothy's plenty of time to dry completely.

The golden rule for drying Rothy's is always air dry. Never put your Rothy's in a tumble dryer. The high heat from a dryer can cause the recycled plastic knit material to shrink, warp, or lose its shape. It can also damage the adhesive that holds parts of the shoe together. This can ruin your shoes. Air drying preserves the shoe's original fit and form.

To air dry your Rothy's, first, gently press out any excess water with a clean towel. You can also pat them dry. Do not wring or twist the shoes forcefully, as this can distort their shape. Next, find a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Direct sun can fade colors over time. High heat, as mentioned, can warp the material. I usually place mine on a drying rack or hang them up by the heel.

You can also stuff your Rothy's with plain white paper towels or clean, dry cloths. This helps absorb internal moisture and maintain the shoe's shape as it dries. Avoid using newspaper, as the ink can transfer to the shoes. Ensure there is good airflow around and inside the shoes. Depending on humidity levels, Rothy's can take anywhere from 12 to 24 hours to fully dry. Make sure they are completely dry before wearing them again or storing them. Damp shoes can develop odors or mold.

## Maintaining Your Rothy's Freshness Between Washes

Cleaning your Rothy's periodically is essential, but daily care also plays a big role in keeping them fresh. Proper maintenance between washes helps extend the time before your next deep clean. It also ensures your shoes always look their best. I practice these simple habits to keep my Rothy's in top condition.

First, consider wearing socks, especially no-show socks, with your Rothy's. While Rothy's are designed to be worn barefoot, socks can absorb sweat and reduce direct contact with your skin. This helps minimize odors and keeps the interior of the shoe cleaner. It is a small change that makes a big difference in freshness. You can find many comfortable sock options that are nearly invisible.

Second, address minor dirt or spills immediately. If you get a small scuff or spill something on your Rothy's, wipe it off right away with a damp cloth. A quick spot clean prevents the dirt from setting into the knit. This can save you from needing a full wash sooner than necessary. A little proactive cleaning goes a long way.

Third, allow your Rothy's to air out after each wear. Do not immediately tuck them away in a dark closet. Let them breathe for a few hours. This helps dissipate any moisture or foot odors. Placing them in a well-ventilated area, perhaps near a window, can work wonders. You can also remove the insoles to help them air out completely. This simple habit prevents the buildup of moisture that can lead to smells.

Finally, rotate your Rothy's with other shoes. Giving your Rothy's a break allows them to fully air out and recover. This also distributes wear across your shoe collection, extending the life of all your footwear. These easy maintenance tips ensure your Rothy's remain comfortable, odor-free, and looking great for much longer.
