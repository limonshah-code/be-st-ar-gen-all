Always address error codes promptly. Ignoring them can lead to more severe damage. If you cannot clear a code, seek professional help. A technician can diagnose complex electronic faults. They have tools to test specific components.

## Addressing Low Water Pressure and Flow Issues

Low water pressure or flow is a common tankless water heater problem. Your Bosch unit needs sufficient water flow to activate. If water pressure is too low, the heater will not turn on. This results in cold water. You might notice low pressure at all hot water faucets.

First, check the water inlet filter. Bosch tankless heaters have a filter at the water inlet. This filter catches sediment from your water supply. Over time, the filter can become clogged. A clogged filter restricts water flow.

To check the filter, turn off the water supply to the heater. Open a hot water faucet to release pressure. Locate the inlet filter. Carefully remove it. Inspect the filter for debris or sediment. Clean the filter thoroughly under running water. A brush can help remove stubborn buildup. Reinstall the clean filter. [Cleaning your water heater filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-water-heater-filter) is a simple task that makes a big difference.

Mineral buildup inside the unit can also restrict flow. Hard water contains minerals like calcium and magnesium. These minerals form scale inside pipes and the heat exchanger. Scale buildup reduces efficiency and flow. This is especially true in areas with hard water.

*   **Check Your Home's Water Pressure:** Low pressure might be a general home issue. Test cold water pressure at various faucets. If cold water pressure is also low, the problem is not isolated to the heater.
*   **Sediment Buildup in Pipes:** Old pipes can accumulate sediment. This affects water flow to your heater. Flushing your plumbing system might be necessary.
*   **Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV):** Some homes have a PRV installed. A malfunctioning PRV can cause low water pressure. Check if your PRV needs adjustment or replacement.

Descaling your Bosch tankless water heater is vital. Descaling removes mineral buildup. This process involves circulating a descaling solution through the unit. It is a maintenance task that prevents many flow problems. You can perform this yourself with a descaling kit. For a thorough clean, refer to guides on [how to clean your tankless water heater](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-tankless-water-heater).

## Diagnosing Ignition and Gas Supply Problems

Gas-powered Bosch tankless water heaters rely on a proper ignition and gas supply. If your unit is not firing up, these are key areas to inspect. Issues here prevent the burner from lighting. This means no hot water for you.

First, verify the gas supply. Is the gas valve to the water heater fully open? Ensure it is parallel to the gas pipe. Check other gas appliances in your home. If your stove or furnace also has no gas, it might be a general gas outage or a tripped main gas valve. Contact your gas utility if this is the case.

Next, consider the ignition system. Modern Bosch units use electronic ignition. You should hear a clicking sound when you turn on a hot water faucet. This click means the igniter is attempting to light the burner. If you hear no clicking, the igniter might be faulty.

*   **Faulty Igniter:** The igniter might be worn out or dirty. It cannot create the spark needed to light the gas. This requires professional replacement.
*   **Flame Sensor Issues:** The flame sensor confirms that the burner has ignited. If it is dirty or defective, it might not detect a flame. The unit then shuts down as a safety measure. Cleaning the flame sensor might resolve this.
*   **Blocked Venting:** Tankless heaters need clear venting for combustion byproducts. A blocked or improperly installed vent pipe can cause safety shutdowns. The unit will not ignite if it detects a venting issue. Check for obstructions in the vent pipe. Birds' nests or debris can block vents.
*   **Gas Pressure Problems:** The gas pressure delivered to the unit must be within the manufacturer's specifications. Too low or too high pressure prevents proper ignition. This is typically a job for a qualified gas technician. They can measure the gas pressure.

Always exercise caution when dealing with gas components. If you smell gas, immediately turn off the gas supply. Ventilate the area. Do not attempt to troubleshoot further. Call a professional or your gas company. DIY gas repairs are dangerous and can be illegal.

## Troubleshooting Strange Noises and Leaks

Your Bosch tankless water heater should operate quietly. Strange noises indicate an internal problem. Hearing rumbling, banging, or sizzling means something is wrong. Leaks are also serious and need immediate attention.
