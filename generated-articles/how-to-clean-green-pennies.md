## How To Clean Green Pennies: Restore Shine Today

Have you ever found an old penny, only to see it covered in an unsightly green film? It is a common sight. This green discoloration, often called verdigris, happens because of oxidation. Copper reacts with elements in the air and moisture. Learning **how to clean green pennies** helps you bring back their original luster. I understand the satisfaction of making something old look new.

This guide will show you safe and simple methods. We will discuss what causes the green color. We will also cover how to assess your pennies before cleaning. Then, I will share step-by-step instructions for popular cleaning solutions. These include common household items like vinegar and lemon juice. Finally, we will talk about how to preserve your newly cleaned coins. By following these steps, you can clean your green pennies effectively. You will also keep them looking good for a long time.

### Takeaway

*   Identify green discoloration on pennies as copper oxidation (verdigris).
*   Always assess a penny's value before cleaning to avoid damaging collector's items.
*   Use gentle, acidic solutions like vinegar or lemon juice with salt to safely remove green film.
*   Rinse and dry pennies completely after cleaning to prevent re-oxidation.
*   Store cleaned pennies properly to maintain their restored appearance.

### What causes pennies to turn green?

Pennies turn green when their copper reacts with oxygen and moisture. This process is called oxidation. The green film is known as verdigris. It forms a protective layer on the copper surface. You can remove this green buildup with common household acids.

## Understanding Green Pennies: What Is That Green Stuff?

When you see green on a penny, you are looking at copper corrosion. Pennies are mostly copper, especially older ones. Copper is a reactive metal. It changes when exposed to air and moisture. This reaction forms a green layer on the surface.

This green substance is commonly called verdigris. It is a type of copper carbonate or copper acetate, depending on the environment. The process happens slowly over time. Pennies found outdoors or in damp places often show more green. Verdigris is usually harmless to the coin's structure. However, it covers the original copper color. Many people prefer their pennies to look bright and shiny. I often find old coins in my collection that need this type of attention. This green layer is similar to what you might see on old copper roofs or statues.

Sometimes, the green can be hard to remove. This means the corrosion is deep. It may require more than one cleaning attempt. Understanding this green buildup is the first step. It helps you choose the right cleaning method. You want to remove the green without damaging the penny's surface.

## Before You Clean: Assessing Penny Value and Risks

Before you start any cleaning, examine your green pennies carefully. Not all pennies should be cleaned. Cleaning can decrease the value of a collector's coin. For common circulation pennies, cleaning is usually fine. I always check a coin's condition before trying to clean it.

Rare or antique pennies hold significant value. Numismatists, coin collectors, prefer coins in their original condition. Even if a coin looks dirty, cleaning it can ruin its "patina." Patina is a natural protective layer. It develops over time. This layer is often desirable for collectors. Removing it can make a valuable coin worthless to them. For example, some old Indian Head Pennies might be very valuable. You should never clean those.

Check the date and mint mark on your penny. Research its rarity. Websites like PCGS or NGC provide coin values. If your penny is rare, consult an expert. A professional coin dealer can offer advice. They can tell you if cleaning is a good idea. For everyday pennies, cleaning is generally safe. You can then proceed with the methods I will describe. Always prioritize preservation over a shiny look for rare coins.

## Gentle Home Methods to Clean Green Pennies

When it comes to cleaning green pennies, gentle methods are always best. You want to remove the green corrosion without scratching the coin's surface. Harsh abrasives or strong chemicals can cause damage. They can leave permanent marks. This is especially true for older, softer copper coins. I prefer starting with the mildest option.

Start with warm water and mild dish soap. This method is surprisingly effective for light green film. It helps loosen surface dirt.

Here is how to do it:

*   Fill a small bowl with warm water.
*   Add a few drops of liquid dish soap.
*   Place your green pennies into the soapy water.
*   Let them soak for about 10-15 minutes. This softens the grime.
*   Use a soft brush, like an old toothbrush, to gently scrub each penny. Move the brush in small circles. Avoid harsh scrubbing.
*   Rinse the pennies thoroughly under running water. Ensure all soap residue is gone.
*   Pat them dry with a soft cloth. You can also air dry them on a towel.

This method works well for surface grime. It may not remove all green. If the green remains, you can move to slightly stronger, but still gentle, acids. Remember, patience is key. Repeated gentle cleaning often works better than one harsh attempt.

## Vinegar and Salt: A Classic Approach for Green Pennies

The combination of vinegar and salt is a classic household remedy for cleaning copper. Both white vinegar and apple cider vinegar work. Vinegar is an acid. Salt acts as a mild abrasive. Together, they create a reaction that dissolves copper oxidation. This method is effective for **how to clean green pennies**. It is one of my go-to solutions for tarnished copper items.

You will need a few simple supplies:

*   White vinegar or apple cider vinegar
*   Table salt
*   A small, non-metal bowl (glass or plastic)
*   A soft cloth
*   Warm water for rinsing

Here are the steps:

1.  **Prepare the solution**: Pour about 1/4 cup of vinegar into your bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of table salt to the vinegar. Stir until the salt dissolves.
2.  **Soak the pennies**: Place your green pennies into the vinegar-salt solution. Make sure the pennies are fully submerged. The green will start to fizz slightly. This shows the reaction is happening.
3.  **Monitor the process**: Let the pennies soak for 5-15 minutes. For very stubborn green, you might soak them longer, up to 30 minutes. Keep an eye on them. You do not want to leave them too long. Over-soaking can etch the copper.
4.  **Gentle scrubbing**: After soaking, remove one penny. Use a soft cloth or a cotton swab to gently wipe away the green film. You can also use a soft toothbrush for tougher spots. Dip the brush in the solution if needed. Be gentle to avoid scratches.
5.  **Rinse thoroughly**: This step is very important. Rinse each penny under warm, running water. Ensure all traces of vinegar and salt are gone. Remaining acid can cause new corrosion. For extra care, you can rinse with distilled water.
6.  **Dry completely**: Pat the pennies dry with a clean, soft cloth. Air dry them for a few hours. Make sure they are completely dry before storing them. Any moisture can lead to new green spots.

This method is highly effective for typical verdigris. It brightens the copper quickly. You can also learn more about [how to clean pennies with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pennies-with-vinegar) for a deeper dive into this specific technique.

## Lemon Juice and Baking Soda: Alternative Cleaning Solutions

If vinegar and salt do not fully remove the green, or you want another option, lemon juice and baking soda are great alternatives. Lemon juice, like vinegar, is acidic. It effectively dissolves copper corrosion. Baking soda is a mild abrasive and can help neutralize acids. I find these ingredients handy in my kitchen for many cleaning tasks.

### Using Lemon Juice and Salt

This method is very similar to the vinegar and salt approach. Lemon juice provides a fresh scent. It is also very effective.

You will need:

*   Fresh lemon juice (from half a lemon or bottled)
*   Table salt
*   A small, non-metal bowl
*   Soft cloth or cotton swab
*   Warm water for rinsing

Steps:

1.  **Combine ingredients**: Squeeze lemon juice into a bowl. Add about a teaspoon of salt. Stir until the salt dissolves.
2.  **Soak the pennies**: Place your green pennies into the lemon juice and salt mixture. Ensure they are covered. Let them soak for 5-10 minutes.
3.  **Light scrub**: Remove a penny. Gently rub it with a soft cloth or cotton swab. The green should come off easily. You can also use an old soft toothbrush for stubborn areas.
4.  **Rinse and dry**: Rinse each penny completely under warm water. Pat them dry with a clean cloth. Allow them to air dry fully.

This method often leaves pennies very shiny. The acidity of the lemon juice works quickly.

### Using Baking Soda Paste

Baking soda works differently. It is an alkaline substance. It can act as a gentle abrasive. It does not dissolve copper corrosion like acids. Instead, it helps scrub it away. You can also use it to neutralize acids after other cleaning methods.

You will need:

*   Baking soda
*   A small amount of water
*   A soft cloth or toothbrush

Steps:

1.  **Make a paste**: Put a spoonful of baking soda in a small dish. Add just enough water to create a thick paste. It should be like toothpaste.
2.  **Apply to penny**: Take a small amount of paste on your finger or a soft cloth. Apply it directly to the green penny.
3.  **Gentle scrub**: Gently rub the paste onto the green areas. Use circular motions. The mild abrasion helps lift the corrosion.
4.  **Rinse thoroughly**: Rinse the penny under warm, running water. Remove all baking soda.
5.  **Dry completely**: Pat dry with a soft cloth. Air dry fully.

Baking soda is good for light tarnish. It is very gentle. You can also use it after an acid soak. It helps neutralize any leftover acid on the coin. This prevents further chemical reactions. It is important to ensure pennies are completely dry after using any liquid. Moisture leads to re-tarnishing.

## Tackling Stubborn Green: When Simple Methods Are Not Enough

Sometimes, the green corrosion on pennies is very stubborn. It might be deeply embedded or very thick. Simple household methods might not remove all of it. In these cases, you might need to use slightly more targeted approaches. Remember, aggressive cleaning can damage the coin. Proceed with caution.

One method involves using a non-abrasive metal polish. This polish is specifically made for copper or brass. It contains very fine abrasives and mild chemicals. It helps lift deeply set tarnish.

Here's how you might use it:

*   **Choose the right polish**: Look for a copper or brass cleaner. Make sure it specifies "non-abrasive." Read the product label carefully.
*   **Apply a small amount**: Put a tiny dab of polish onto a soft cloth.
*   **Gentle rubbing**: Gently rub the penny with the cloth. Use small, circular motions. Do not press hard. The goal is to lift the green, not to grind it off.
*   **Buff to shine**: Use a clean part of the cloth to buff the penny. This removes polish residue and adds shine.
*   **Rinse (if instructed)**: Some polishes require rinsing. Others just need buffing. Follow the product instructions.
*   **Dry thoroughly**: Ensure the penny is completely dry.

Another option for very tough green is extended soaking. You can increase the soak time in vinegar or lemon juice. Instead of 15 minutes, try 1-2 hours. Some people even soak overnight for extreme cases. However, this increases the risk of etching or damaging the copper. I would only try this for pennies with no collector value. Always check the penny frequently during extended soaks. If you see pitting or changes, remove it immediately.

You can also use a mixture of ketchup. Ketchup contains vinegar (acetic acid) and other mild acids. It is surprisingly effective for copper tarnish.

*   **Apply ketchup**: Spread a thin layer of ketchup over the green penny.
*   **Let it sit**: Leave the ketchup on for 5-10 minutes.
*   **Rub and rinse**: Gently rub the penny with a soft cloth or fingers. Then rinse it thoroughly with water.
*   **Dry completely**.

For extremely tough spots, some people use a very fine abrasive paste. This might include a tiny bit of toothpaste (non-gel, non-whitening) or a specialized coin cleaner. Be extremely careful. These can easily scratch the surface. Use the absolute smallest amount. Rub with light pressure. Rinse quickly. Always prioritize safety for the coin. If the green does not come off easily, it might be better to leave it. Over-cleaning can cause more damage than the green itself.

## Post-Cleaning Care: Preserving Your Clean Pennies

Cleaning your green pennies is only half the battle. Once you restore their shine, you must protect them. Improper post-cleaning care can lead to new tarnishing. It can also damage the coin. My aim is always to make the clean last.

The most important step after cleaning is thorough drying. Any residual moisture will react with the copper. This causes new green spots or general tarnish.

Here is how to ensure proper drying:

*   **Initial Pat Dry**: After rinsing, gently pat each penny dry with a soft, lint-free cloth. Microfiber cloths work well.
*   **Air Drying**: Place the pennies on a clean, dry towel or paper towel. Allow them to air dry for several hours. You can even leave them overnight. Turn them over once to ensure both sides dry.
*   **Avoid Heat**: Do not use direct heat sources like hair dryers or ovens. Rapid heating can cause discoloration or warp the metal.

Once your pennies are completely dry, proper storage is crucial for preservation. Exposure to air, especially humid air, will cause them to re-tarnish.

Consider these storage options:

*   **Coin Flips**: These are small, clear plastic or Mylar envelopes. Make sure they are PVC-free. PVC can damage coins over time. Place one penny in each flip.
*   **Coin Holders**: Cardboard coin holders with Mylar windows are also good. You staple them shut. This provides a clear view and good protection.
*   **Coin Tubes**: For larger quantities of common pennies, plastic coin tubes are useful. They keep coins upright and reduce air exposure.
*   **Albums**: Coin albums are great for organizing. Ensure the album pages are made from archival-safe materials. Avoid pages with soft, flexible plastic.
*   **Desiccants**: For added protection, you can place silica gel packets in your coin storage containers. These absorb moisture. Replace them every few months.

Store your cleaned pennies in a cool, dry place. Avoid basements, attics, or areas with extreme temperature changes. Consistent conditions help prevent re-tarnishing. By taking these steps, your pennies will stay clean and bright for much longer.
