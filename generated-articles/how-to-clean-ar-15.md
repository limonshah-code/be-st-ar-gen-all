### How do you clean an AR-15?

Cleaning an AR-15 involves disassembling the rifle into its main components. You clean carbon, dirt, and fouling from the barrel, bolt carrier group, and receivers. Then, you lubricate key parts to ensure smooth operation. Finally, you reassemble and perform a function check.

## Why Cleaning Your AR-15 Matters for Safety and Reliability

Many people enjoy shooting their AR-15 rifles. However, some forget about the importance of cleaning. A dirty rifle can cause serious problems. It might stop working when you need it most.

Carbon and unburnt powder build up inside the rifle. This residue causes friction. It can slow down moving parts. Over time, parts can wear out faster. Cleaning helps prevent this damage. It keeps your AR-15 reliable and safe for every use.

### Prevent Malfunctions

Dirty rifles often fail to cycle properly. They might not feed a new round. The spent casing might get stuck. These are called malfunctions. They can be dangerous, especially in a stressful situation.

Regular cleaning removes the grime that causes these issues. It ensures all parts move freely. This helps your rifle operate as designed. You reduce the risk of jams and misfires.

### Extend Lifespan

Your AR-15 is an investment. You want it to last a long time. Dirt and carbon act like sandpaper on metal parts. They cause wear and tear. This leads to parts breaking sooner.

Cleaning protects these parts. It removes abrasive materials. It also allows for proper lubrication. This helps metal parts glide smoothly. A well-maintained rifle lasts for many years.

### Maintain Accuracy

A dirty barrel can affect shot accuracy. Carbon and copper deposits build up in the bore. These deposits change the path of the bullet. This can make your shots go off target.

Cleaning the barrel restores its smooth surface. It allows the bullet to travel cleanly. This helps maintain your rifle's original accuracy. You will see better results at the range.

## Essential AR-15 Cleaning Supplies You Will Need

Before you start cleaning, gather all your tools. Having everything ready saves time. It makes the cleaning process easier. You do not want to stop in the middle to find something.

Some basic items are necessary for a good clean. These include solvents, lubricants, brushes, and patches. Make sure you have a well-lit area. Also, use a surface that can get dirty. Many gun owners use a cleaning mat.

### Solvents and Lubricants

You need specific products for firearm cleaning. Do not use household cleaners. They might damage your rifle's finish or parts. Dedicated gun solvents break down carbon and lead.

Gun lubricants keep parts moving smoothly. They prevent rust. Choose a good quality "CLP" (cleaner, lubricant, protectant) or separate products. You can learn more about [mastering general cleaning](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-everything) to understand basic principles. Some people prefer a light oil, others a grease.

### Brushes and Rods

You need different brushes for different areas. A bore brush cleans the inside of the barrel. Use one made of bronze or nylon. A chamber brush is also important for the AR-15's chamber.

A cleaning rod helps you push patches through the barrel. Make sure it is long enough. A general-purpose nylon brush helps clean other parts. You might also want a dental pick. This helps remove stubborn carbon from small spaces.

### Cleaning Patches and Rags

Cleaning patches absorb solvent and wipe away dirt. Use cotton patches of the correct size. They should fit snugly in the bore. You will use many patches. Have plenty on hand.

Clean rags are useful for wiping down surfaces. They help apply lubricant evenly. Microfiber cloths work well for this. Avoid cloths that leave lint. Lint can get into moving parts.

## Disassembling Your AR-15 for Cleaning Safely

The first step to cleaning is taking your rifle apart. This is called field stripping. It lets you reach the dirty areas. Always prioritize safety during this step.

Do not rush the disassembly. Understand each part as you remove it. This helps you reassemble it correctly later. A proper order ensures you do not lose small parts. It also keeps you safe.

### Safety First

Before you touch anything, always confirm your rifle is unloaded. Remove the magazine first. Then, pull the charging handle back. Look into the chamber to ensure no round is present. Visually and physically check.

Point the rifle in a safe direction. Keep your finger off the trigger. This is a critical step. Never skip it. Safety is always your top concern when handling any firearm.

### Field Stripping Steps

Field stripping an AR-15 is quite simple. First, push out the rear takedown pin. You can often do this with your thumb. If it is stiff, use a punch or a tool.

Pivot the upper receiver up from the lower receiver. Then, push out the front pivot pin. Now, separate the upper and lower receivers completely. Pull the charging handle and bolt carrier group out of the upper receiver. This is the main assembly you will clean. These steps make the rifle ready for deeper cleaning.

## Cleaning the Upper Receiver and Barrel Thoroughly

The upper receiver holds the barrel and bolt carrier group. These parts get very dirty. They see a lot of carbon buildup. This carbon comes from burning gunpowder. It is sticky and hard to remove.

Properly cleaning these areas ensures smooth cycling. It also maintains accuracy. Pay close attention to the bore and the chamber. These are critical for your rifle's performance. Neglecting them leads to problems.

### Barrel Cleaning Techniques

Start with the barrel. Use a bore brush with solvent. Push the brush through the barrel from the chamber end. Go all the way out the muzzle. Then, pull it back out. Do this several times.

Next, push solvent-soaked patches through the barrel. Use a jag on your cleaning rod. Push them through one by one. Change patches until they come out clean. Finish with a lightly oiled patch to protect the bore. This process removes carbon and copper fouling.

### Bolt Carrier Group (BCG) Cleaning

The bolt carrier group is the heart of your AR-15. It gets very dirty. Carbon builds up on the bolt, bolt carrier, and firing pin. These parts need careful attention.

Disassemble the bolt carrier group. Remove the firing pin retainer pin. Pull out the firing pin. Then remove the cam pin. The bolt will slide out of the carrier. Clean each piece with solvent. Pay special attention to the bolt tail. Use a carbon scraper if needed. Clean the inside of the bolt carrier. After cleaning, lubricate all parts well. Reassemble the BCG carefully. This ensures smooth operation.

## Cleaning the Lower Receiver for Optimal Performance

The lower receiver houses the trigger group and buffer system. It does not get as dirty as the upper. However, it still needs attention. Dust, dirt, and some carbon can settle here. This buildup can affect trigger feel. It can also impact buffer system function.

Keeping the lower receiver clean ensures reliable feeding and ejection. It helps maintain the overall function of your AR-15. You do not need to disassemble the trigger group often. A light cleaning is usually enough.

### Inside the Lower

Use a small brush and some solvent to clean the interior. Focus on the trigger group area. Wipe away any dirt or carbon. Be careful not to spray solvent directly into the trigger mechanism.

Use cotton swabs to reach tight spots. Wipe down the inside surfaces. Remove any lint or debris. A clean lower receiver contributes to a smoother operating rifle. Think about general principles for [maintaining different materials](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes) when cleaning the metal and polymer parts.

### Buffer Tube Inspection

The buffer tube and spring also need attention. Pull out the buffer and spring. Wipe them down with a clean rag. Check the buffer for any signs of wear. Look for any damage to the spring.

A little lubrication on the buffer spring helps reduce noise. It also allows for smoother cycling. Ensure no debris is inside the buffer tube. This helps the buffer system work correctly. It keeps your rifle running smoothly.

## Lubrication: The Key to Smooth Operation After Cleaning

Cleaning removes dirt. It also removes lubrication. Your AR-15 needs proper lubrication to work. Metal parts rub against each other. Without oil, they wear out fast. This causes malfunctions.

Lubrication creates a thin film. This film reduces friction. It prevents rust. A well-lubricated rifle runs smoothly and reliably. Do not skip this important step. It is as important as cleaning.

### Applying Lubricant

Apply lubricant sparingly. More is not always better. A thin, even coat works best. Use a clean rag or applicator. Focus on areas where metal meets metal. These are high-friction points.

Different lubricants have different thicknesses. Choose one suitable for your climate. Some gun oils are thick, others thin. Always follow the lubricant manufacturer's directions. This ensures best results.

### Key Lubrication Points

Several areas need lubrication. The bolt carrier group is most important. Lubricate the bolt, cam pin, and firing pin. Apply oil to the rails of the bolt carrier. Lubricate the charging handle.

Also, add a drop of oil to the trigger group pins. A small amount on the buffer spring helps. Remember, proper lubrication protects your rifle. It keeps it ready for action.

## Reassembly and Final Checks for Your AR-15

You have cleaned and lubricated your AR-15. Now it is time to put it back together. Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly. Take your time. Make sure each part goes back in its correct place.

After reassembly, always perform a function check. This ensures your rifle is safe. It confirms everything works as it should. This step is critical before any live fire.

### Reassembly Steps

Start by inserting the lubricated bolt carrier group into the upper receiver. Guide the charging handle in at the same time. Ensure they slide in smoothly.

Align the upper receiver with the lower receiver. Push in the front pivot pin first. Then, push in the rear takedown pin. Make sure both pins are fully seated. Give them a firm push. The rifle should feel solid and together.

### Function Check

Perform a safety check after reassembly. First, ensure the rifle is still unloaded. Point it in a safe direction. Place the selector switch on "SAFE." Pull the trigger. It should not move.

Next, move the selector to "SEMI." Pull the charging handle back. Release it. Pull the trigger. You should hear a click. Hold the trigger back. Pull the charging handle again. Release it. Slowly release the trigger. You should hear a reset click. This confirms the trigger group works correctly. If it does not, recheck your assembly.
