### Understanding Why Birkenstocks Get Stinky

Birkenstocks are popular for their unique design. They have a contoured footbed. This footbed molds to your feet over time. It gives custom comfort. However, this close contact also traps sweat and skin cells. Your feet naturally produce sweat. This sweat mixes with dead skin cells inside the shoe. This creates a breeding ground for bacteria. These bacteria cause the bad smell. They thrive in damp, warm places. Birkenstocks often become damp from sweat. The cork and suede materials can absorb moisture. This absorption makes them more prone to odor.

The footbed is a key area for stink. It is made of suede or leather. These materials are porous. They soak up moisture easily. When bacteria break down sweat, they release smelly compounds. This is why your Birkenstocks can smell bad. The straps, often leather or synthetic, also collect dirt and sweat. Regular cleaning is important to fight these smells. Without cleaning, the odor builds up. It becomes stronger over time. Understanding the cause helps us clean them better. We can target the source of the smell. This makes cleaning more effective.

### Gathering Supplies to Clean Stinky Birkenstocks

Before you start cleaning, gather all your materials. Having everything ready makes the process smooth. You will need a few common household items. These items are effective for odor removal. They also clean the materials without damage. First, get a stiff brush. An old toothbrush works well for small areas. A suede brush is also good for the footbed. Next, you need baking soda. Baking soda is a great natural deodorizer. It absorbs smells. You also need white vinegar. Vinegar kills bacteria and breaks down grime. It helps remove deep odors.

You will need mild soap. Dish soap or saddle soap works. Water is essential for cleaning. Have a few clean cloths or sponges ready. These are for wiping and drying. A small bowl for mixing solutions is helpful. For tougher stains, you might want a specialized cleaner. A Birkenstock cleaning kit often includes these items. If you have different Birkenstock materials, like plastic or oiled leather, gather specific cleaners for those. Knowing what you need helps you clean your Birkenstocks well. Prepare these items to get started.

### Cleaning the Birkenstock Footbed for Odor Removal

The footbed is where most of the stink comes from. It collects sweat and grime. Cleaning it properly removes the smell. First, use a stiff brush to remove loose dirt. Brush the suede or leather footbed gently. This lifts any dry mud or debris. After brushing, sprinkle baking soda over the entire footbed. Let it sit for several hours, even overnight. Baking soda absorbs the deep-set odors. It neutralizes them. You can also mix baking soda with a little water to form a paste. Apply this paste directly to the footbed. Rub it in with your brush. Let it sit for about 15-30 minutes.

Next, combine equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Lightly mist the footbed with this solution. The vinegar helps kill bacteria. It also breaks down oils and dirt. Be careful not to saturate the footbed. Too much moisture can damage the cork or leather. Use your stiff brush to gently scrub the footbed again. Focus on stained or very smelly areas. You will see grime lifting away. This process removes the dirt and the source of the odor.

This step is key to making your Birkenstocks smell fresh.

### Washing Birkenstock Straps and Cork Soles

After cleaning the footbed, focus on the straps and cork soles. These parts also gather dirt. The straps are usually made of leather, synthetic material, or Birko-Flor. The cork sole is around the edges. For leather or Birko-Flor straps, use a damp cloth. Apply a small amount of mild soap to the cloth. Gently wipe down the straps. Rub off any dirt or grime. For oiled leather straps, you might use a special leather cleaner. Be gentle not to scrub too hard. This prevents damage to the material. You can learn more about caring for these materials in our guide on [how to clean oiled leather Birkenstocks](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-oiled-leather-birkenstocks).

The cork sole needs careful cleaning. It is fragile when wet. Do not immerse it in water. Use a slightly damp cloth. You can also use a small amount of mild soap. Gently wipe the cork. This removes surface dirt. Avoid scrubbing too hard. You do not want to damage the cork sealant. If the cork sealant is worn, you can reapply it. Birkenstock sells cork sealer for this purpose. This protects the cork from moisture and damage. Taking care of the straps and soles completes the cleaning process. It helps your Birkenstocks look and feel cleaner overall.

### Using Natural Remedies for Birkenstock Odor

Natural remedies are effective for removing smells. They are also safe for your Birkenstocks. Baking soda is a top choice. We already mentioned it for the footbed. For daily maintenance, you can sprinkle a little baking soda inside the shoes overnight. It absorbs moisture and odors. Just tap it out in the morning. White vinegar is another powerful natural cleaner. Its acidic nature kills odor-causing bacteria. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Spray this lightly inside the shoes. Make sure to let it air dry. The vinegar smell disappears as it dries. You can also use essential oils. Tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil have antibacterial properties. Add a few drops to the vinegar spray. They add a fresh scent.

Another simple remedy is sunlight. Place your Birkenstocks in direct sunlight for a few hours. UV rays kill bacteria. This helps air out the shoes. Make sure not to leave them in the sun for too long. Excessive heat can dry out leather and crack the cork. You can also use activated charcoal. Charcoal bags or inserts absorb odors. Place them inside your shoes when not in use. These natural methods help eliminate lingering smells. They are gentle on your Birkenstocks. They keep your sandals smelling fresh without harsh chemicals. For more general shoe odor help, see our article on [how to clean stinky Crocs](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stinky-crocs).

### Drying Birkenstocks and Final Deodorizing

Proper drying is crucial after cleaning. If Birkenstocks remain damp, new odors can develop. Always air dry your sandals. Never use direct heat sources. Avoid placing them in direct sunlight for extended periods. Do not use a hairdryer or a clothes dryer. High heat can shrink the leather. It can also crack the cork footbed. Instead, find a cool, dry place. A well-ventilated room is ideal. Place your Birkenstocks where air can circulate around them. You can stuff them with crumpled newspaper. Newspaper absorbs excess moisture. Change the newspaper every few hours until the shoes are dry.

Drying usually takes 24 to 48 hours. Check the footbed to ensure it is completely dry before wearing. If it feels even slightly damp, continue drying. Once dry, you can do a final deodorizing step. Sprinkle a thin layer of baking soda inside the shoes. Let it sit for a few hours, then tap it out. You can also use commercial shoe deodorizers. These often come as sprays or powders. Some people use dryer sheets. Place one inside each shoe overnight. They add a fresh scent. Proper drying ensures your cleaning efforts last. It prevents mold and mildew. This step makes your Birkenstocks truly fresh.

### Preventing Stinky Birkenstocks: Long-Term Care

Preventing odor is easier than removing it. Regular care keeps your Birkenstocks fresh. Do not wear your Birkenstocks every day. Give them a day to rest between wears. This allows them to fully dry out. Have an alternate pair of shoes. When you take off your Birkenstocks, air them out. Do not store them in a closed closet right away. Let them sit in an open area for a few hours. This allows moisture to evaporate. You can also use foot powders. Apply an anti-odor foot powder to your feet before wearing. This helps absorb sweat. It reduces moisture inside the shoe.

Consider using shoe trees made of cedar. Cedar wood absorbs moisture and odors. Place them in your Birkenstocks when you are not wearing them. They also help maintain the shoe's shape. Clean the footbed regularly. A quick brush-off removes loose dirt. A light sprinkle of baking soda once a week helps. This proactive approach prevents odor buildup. Reapply cork sealant to the cork sole annually. This protects the cork from water damage. It also prevents dirt from seeping in. By following these care tips, your Birkenstocks will stay fresh longer. You will enjoy your favorite sandals for many years. Regular cleaning and care truly make a difference.

### FAQ Section

**Q1: Can I put my Birkenstocks in the washing machine?**
No, you should not put Birkenstocks in a washing machine. The washing machine can severely damage the cork footbed and the leather or suede materials. Water can dissolve the glues and cork sealant, causing the sandals to fall apart. Always clean Birkenstocks by hand using gentle methods. This protects their unique structure and extends their life.

**Q2: How often should I clean my stinky Birkenstocks?**
The frequency depends on how often you wear them and how much your feet sweat. If you wear them daily, a light cleaning or deodorizing might be needed weekly. A deep clean, like the one described, should be done every few months or when you notice a strong odor. Regular maintenance prevents heavy odor buildup.

**Q3: What if my Birkenstocks still smell after cleaning?**
If odor remains, repeat the baking soda and vinegar treatment. Ensure you allow enough time for the baking soda to absorb odors.

Store Birkenstocks in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area. Avoid humid places like bathrooms or damp closets. You can use shoe trees or stuff them with newspaper to absorb moisture.
