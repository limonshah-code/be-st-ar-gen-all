### Clear Answer to Main Query

To drain water from your pool after rain, lower the water level using your pool's main drain, a submersible pump, or a siphon. Ensure the water drains to an approved area. Prevent damage to the pool structure and surrounding landscape.

## Understanding High Pool Water Levels After Rain

Heavy rain often adds more water to your pool than it can handle. This excess water can lead to several problems for pool owners. It is important to act quickly when your pool water level is too high. Ignoring this issue can create costly repairs later. I have seen many pools face issues from neglected water levels.

First, too much water strains your pool equipment. The skimmer opening is designed to work at a specific water level. If the water goes above this point, the skimmer cannot pull in debris effectively. This means more leaves and dirt stay in your pool. Pumps and filters also work harder when skimmers do not function properly. Overworking these parts can shorten their lifespan. You might face early replacements, which are expensive.

Second, high water levels can cause chemical imbalances. Rainwater often has a different pH level than your pool water. It dilutes your pool chemicals. This reduces the effectiveness of your chlorine or other sanitizers. Algae and bacteria can grow quickly in imbalanced water. Your pool might turn green or cloudy, requiring more effort to clean. [Cleaning the bottom of a pool](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bottom-of-a-pool) or scrubbing [pool walls](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pool-walls) becomes a bigger chore when the water is not balanced.

Finally, very high water levels can flood your pool deck. This creates slippery surfaces. It can also cause water damage to nearby structures. If your deck has poor drainage, water might sit for long periods. This leads to mold growth or structural issues with the deck itself. Knowing when to drain is key. Look for water levels above the middle of your skimmer opening. This is a common indicator that draining is necessary.

## Essential Tools for Draining Pool Water

You need the right tools to drain excess water from your pool efficiently. Each tool offers a different way to lower the water level. Choosing the best option depends on your pool type and personal preference. I have used all these methods myself.

One common tool is a **submersible pump**. This electric pump sits directly in your pool water. It has a hose connection to direct the water away. Submersible pumps are fast and powerful. They can move a lot of water quickly. You just place the pump in the deepest part of your pool. Then you connect a discharge hose and turn it on. They work well for all pool types, including above-ground and in-ground pools. Make sure you use a pump designed for pool water.

Another simple tool is a standard **garden hose** for the siphon method. This method uses gravity to pull water out of your pool. It is slower than a pump but requires no electricity. You will need a long hose for this. It is a good option if you only need to remove a small amount of water. It also works well if you do not own a pump. This method is cost-effective and easy to set up.

Your pool filter system can also help you drain water. Many pool filter systems have a "backwash" or "waste" setting. This is especially true for sand filters and DE filters. When you set your filter to "backwash" or "waste," it bypasses the filter media. Instead, it sends water directly out through a waste line. This method is convenient because you are already familiar with your pool equipment. It also helps clean your filter at the same time. If you have a [sand filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-drain-a-pool-with-a-sand-filter), this is often the easiest way to remove excess water. Understanding how to use your main drain for this process is helpful. Sometimes, you may even need to [blow out your main drain for inground pools](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-blow-out-main-drain-inground-pool) for better drainage.

## Draining Methods: Step-by-Step Guides

Draining your pool water does not have to be difficult. I will walk you through the most common methods. Each method has its own steps and benefits. You can choose the one that fits your situation best.

### Using Your Pool's Backwash or Drain Setting

This is often the easiest method for in-ground pools with a multi-port valve.

1.  **Turn Off the Pool Pump:** Always turn off your pump before changing any valve settings. This prevents damage to your equipment. You want to ensure no water moves through the system unexpectedly.
2.  **Set the Multi-Port Valve:** Locate the large handle on top of your filter. This is your multi-port valve. Turn the handle to the "Backwash" or "Waste" setting. The exact label depends on your filter model. "Waste" directly drains water without filtering it. "Backwash" also drains water while cleaning the filter media.
3.  **Open the Waste Line Valve:** Some systems have a separate valve on the waste line. Make sure this valve is open. This allows water to flow out freely.
4.  **Turn On the Pool Pump:** Briefly turn on your pool pump. Water will start to flow out of the waste line. You will see the water level in your pool begin to drop.
5.  **Monitor the Water Level:** Watch your pool's water level closely. You want to stop draining once the water is at the normal level. This is usually halfway up your skimmer opening. Turn off the pump immediately when it reaches this point.
6.  **Return Valve to Filter Position:** Once draining is complete, turn off the pump again. Return the multi-port valve to the "Filter" position. Re-open any closed valves on your system.
7.  **Run the Pump:** Turn your pump back on to resume normal filtration. This method is great because it uses your existing equipment. If you have a [sand filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-drain-a-pool-with-a-sand-filter), this is likely the method you will use.

### Employing a Submersible Pump

A submersible pump provides a fast and efficient way to remove a large amount of water.

1.  **Prepare the Pump:** Connect a garden hose or a larger discharge hose to the pump's outlet. Make sure the connection is secure.
2.  **Place the Pump:** Lower the submersible pump into the deepest part of your pool. Ensure the pump sits flat on the pool bottom. Avoid placing it directly on debris or in a position where it might tip over.
3.  **Position the Discharge Hose:** Direct the end of the discharge hose to an approved drainage area. This area must be safe for chlorinated water. Consider local regulations before you start.
4.  **Plug In and Power On:** Plug the pump into a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet. Turn the pump on. The pump will start drawing water out of your pool immediately.
5.  **Monitor Water Level:** Stay near the pool and watch the water level carefully. Submersible pumps work quickly. You do not want to accidentally drain too much water. Turn off the pump as soon as the water reaches your desired level.
6.  **Remove the Pump:** Unplug the pump first. Then, carefully lift the pump out of the pool. Disconnect the hose and store the pump properly.

### The Siphon Method (Garden Hose)

The siphon method is a simple, no-power option for small amounts of water.

1.  **Completely Submerge the Hose:** Place one end of a standard garden hose into your pool. Push the entire hose underwater until it fills completely with water. You can see air bubbles stop when it is full.
2.  **Cap One End (or Keep Submerged):** While the hose is still full of water, cap the end outside the pool with your thumb or hand. Or, keep it submerged while you quickly move it.
3.  **Lower the Outlet End:** Quickly lift the capped end out of the pool. Carry it to your drainage area. This area must be lower than the pool's water level. Gravity is crucial for this method to work.
4.  **Release and Start Siphon:** Release your thumb or hand from the hose end. Water should begin to flow out of the pool. If it stops, you will need to re-prime the hose.
5.  **Monitor and Remove:** Watch the water level closely. Once you reach the desired level, simply pull the hose out of the pool. The siphoning action will stop. This method is slower but effective for minor water adjustments.

## Where to Safely Drain Pool Water

Draining pool water requires careful consideration of where the water goes. You cannot just send it anywhere. Proper discharge protects your property and the environment. I always check local rules before I drain.

First, you must understand your **local regulations**. Many cities and counties have rules about pool water discharge. These rules often specify acceptable drainage points. They might also have limits on chlorine levels in the water. Contact your local public works department or environmental agency. They can provide specific guidelines. Discharging improperly can lead to fines. It can also harm local ecosystems.

Second, consider **approved drainage areas**.
*   **Storm Drains (if permitted):** In some areas, draining into a storm drain is acceptable. Storm drains usually lead to natural bodies of water. Make sure your pool water is de-chlorinated if you use this option. Chlorine can harm aquatic life.
*   **Your Lawn or Landscaping:** This is often a good option if your lawn can absorb the water. Spread the water out over a large area. This prevents flooding. Direct the water away from your house foundation. Too much water near the foundation can cause structural damage. Ensure the water drains away from neighboring properties. Be aware that a lot of chlorinated water can harm plants and grass. De-chlorinate the water first if you are concerned about your plants.
*   **Street or Gutter (if permitted):** In some residential areas, draining onto the street or into a gutter is allowed. The water then typically flows into the storm drain system. Again, confirm local rules before doing this. You want to avoid creating hazards for drivers or pedestrians.

Finally, know the **areas to avoid**.
*   **Septic Systems:** Never drain pool water into a septic system. The large volume of water can overwhelm the system. Chlorine can also kill the beneficial bacteria in your septic tank. This leads to system failure.
*   **Neighbor's Property:** Do not direct water onto a neighbor's yard or property. This can cause disputes. It might also lead to property damage for them.
*   **Sewage Systems:** Do not drain into a sanitary sewer unless specifically instructed by your municipality. These systems are for household waste, not large volumes of pool water.

Considerations like chlorine levels and discharge rate are important. If your pool water is heavily chlorinated, let it sit for a few days before draining. Sunlight helps dissipate chlorine naturally. You can also use a de-chlorinating agent. Drain water slowly to allow for absorption. This reduces runoff. Managing [rain gutters](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-rain-gutters) around your home can also help manage runoff from your property.

## Post-Drain Pool Care and Chemical Rebalancing

After you successfully drain excess water from your pool, your work is not completely done. The pool might have a lower water level, but its chemistry might be off. Rainwater introduces new elements. It dilutes existing chemicals. Proper post-drain care helps restore your pool to perfect condition. I always perform these steps.

First, **test your water chemistry immediately**. Heavy rain can significantly alter your pool's pH, alkalinity, and sanitizer levels. Collect a water sample from your pool. Use a reliable test kit or strips. You want to check the pH first. The ideal range is 7.4 to 7.6. Then, check the total alkalinity. It should be between 80 to 120 ppm (parts per million). Finally, measure your sanitizer level, usually chlorine. The free chlorine level should be between 1-3 ppm. If you have a [salt water pool](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-salt-water-pool), you still need to check chlorine levels and potentially salt.

Second, **adjust your chemicals as needed**. Based on your test results, add the necessary chemicals slowly.
*   If your pH is low, add a pH Increaser (soda ash).
*   If your pH is high, add a pH Decreaser (muriatic acid or dry acid).
*   For low alkalinity, add an alkalinity Increaser (sodium bicarbonate).
*   For low chlorine, add granular chlorine or shock your pool. Always follow product instructions carefully. Add chemicals in small increments. Allow time for them to circulate before retesting.

Third, **clean any debris introduced by the rain**. Rain often brings leaves, dirt, and other organic matter into your pool. Skim the surface thoroughly. Use a pool brush to clean the walls and bottom. Then, use your pool vacuum to remove any settled debris. Sometimes, even after draining, you might find new stains on your [pool tile](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pool-tile) from runoff. Address these promptly.

Finally, **check your skimmer and filter**. Make sure your skimmer basket is clear. The water level should now be at the midpoint of the skimmer opening. This allows it to function properly. If you used the backwash setting to drain, your filter is already partially clean. If you used a pump, consider a routine backwash or filter cleaning soon. This ensures your filtration system runs efficiently. Proper care now prevents bigger problems later.

## Preventing Excessive Rainwater Accumulation

Preventing high water levels is often easier than fixing them after a storm. Taking proactive steps can save you time and effort. I have found prevention to be key for easy pool maintenance.

One effective solution is using an **automatic pool cover**. These covers protect your pool from debris. They also prevent rainwater from directly entering the pool. Some covers are designed to shed water off to the sides. This keeps the pool water level stable. While a cover is an investment, it saves chemicals and cleaning time in the long run. It is especially useful if you live in an area with frequent heavy rains.

Another important aspect is **proper drainage around your pool deck**. If your deck slopes towards the pool, it will funnel rainwater directly into it. Ensure your deck has a slight slope away from the pool. This directs water to yard drains or other approved areas. Installing deck drains can also help. These drains collect water on the deck surface. They channel it away from the pool. [Cleaning your pool deck drains](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-pool-deck-drain) regularly ensures they function properly. Clogged drains cannot do their job.

**Regular monitoring** of your pool's water level is also a simple prevention strategy. After every significant rain event, check your pool. If the level is rising quickly, you can take action early. You might only need to do a small drain, not a major one. This saves time and minimizes disruption to your pool chemistry. Keeping an eye on weather forecasts helps too. If heavy rain is predicted, you can lower your water level slightly beforehand. This creates a buffer zone.

Consider a **leveling system** for severe cases. Some advanced pool systems can automatically detect high water levels. They initiate a small drain cycle without your intervention. These systems are rare for residential pools. However, they exist for specific needs. For most homeowners, active management of covers, deck drainage, and consistent monitoring are the best strategies. These actions keep your pool at the correct level, even during rainy seasons.

## Common Mistakes When Draining Pool Water and How to Avoid Them

Even with the best intentions, mistakes can happen when draining your pool. Knowing these common pitfalls can help you avoid them. I have seen many people make these errors.

One common mistake is **draining too much water**. It is easy to get distracted and let the water level drop too low. If your pool's water level falls below the skimmer or jets, it can cause problems. Air can get into your pump. This can lead to your pump running dry and burning out. Always monitor the draining process closely. Set a timer as a reminder. Stop draining when the water level reaches the midpoint of your skimmer.

Another error is **draining too quickly, especially with vinyl liners**. Fast draining can create a vacuum effect. This can pull the vinyl liner away from the pool walls. This leads to wrinkles or permanent damage. If you have a vinyl liner, drain slowly. Use a lower flow rate if possible. Always ensure the ground around your pool is not saturated with groundwater. This brings us to the next point.

**Ignoring local regulations** is a serious mistake. Every area has rules about where you can discharge pool water. Discharging chlorinated water into storm drains might be illegal. Draining into a neighbor's yard is never okay. Check with your local municipality or public works department. They will tell you the correct way to dispose of the water. Failing to do so can result in fines or environmental damage.

Many people also **forget to rebalance chemicals** after draining. Rainwater dilutes your pool's chemistry. It also brings in new contaminants. If you just drain and walk away, your pool can quickly become unhealthy. Algae can bloom. The water can become cloudy. Always test your pool water after draining. Then, add the necessary chemicals to bring it back to balance. This step is crucial for maintaining a clean and safe swimming environment.

Finally, **draining when the water table is high** can cause severe damage to in-ground pools. A high water table means there is a lot of groundwater around your pool shell. If you drain your pool when the surrounding ground is saturated, the empty pool can float out of the ground. This phenomenon is called "popping." It causes catastrophic structural damage. It often happens after heavy, prolonged rain. Avoid draining your in-ground pool completely or significantly if the ground is very wet. If you must drain, do it slowly. Consider professional help if you suspect a high water table.
