## Common Photosmart 6520 Print Quality Issues

Your HP Photosmart 6520 should produce sharp, clear prints. Sometimes, prints appear streaky, faded, or have incorrect colors. These issues indicate a problem with the ink system. We can often fix these problems with simple steps. Let us explore common print quality fixes.

### Fixing Streaks and Fades

Streaks or faded output are common signs of low ink or a clogged printhead. First, check your ink levels. Replace any cartridges that are low or empty. If ink levels are fine, the printhead might need cleaning. I always start here when my prints look off.

Your printer has a built-in cleaning utility. Access it through the printer's control panel or your computer's printer software. Run the cleaning cycle two or three times if needed. This process pushes ink through the nozzles to clear any blockages. Patience is key during this step.

### Addressing Color Inaccuracies

Colors on your prints might not match what you see on screen. This can be due to incorrect printer settings or a misaligned printhead. First, verify your print settings in the print dialog box. Make sure you select the correct paper type and print quality. Photo paper settings differ from plain paper.

Next, consider printhead alignment. The printer uses an alignment process to ensure colors print in the correct positions. Running an alignment utility can often resolve color shifts. You usually find this option near the cleaning utility in your printer software. Proper alignment helps create accurate colors.

### Printhead Cleaning and Alignment

The printhead is crucial for good print quality. It delivers ink to the paper. Over time, ink can dry on the nozzles. This causes streaks or missing colors. Running a printhead cleaning cycle forces ink through the nozzles. This removes dried ink. You can find detailed steps on how to clean printer heads for HP printers in our guides, which can be similar to the [How to Clean HP Deskjet Printer Heads](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hp-deskjet-printer-heads) article.

After cleaning, the printhead might need alignment. Alignment ensures the nozzles deliver ink precisely. Misalignment can cause blurry text or color overlaps. Your Photosmart 6520 usually prints an alignment page. You then scan this page. The printer uses the scan to adjust itself. Regularly cleaning and aligning your printhead helps maintain top print quality for your HP Photosmart 6520. For more advanced printhead cleaning tips for similar HP models, you might also find relevant information in guides such as [How to Clean HP OfficeJet Pro 8600 Printhead](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hp-officejet-pro-8600-printhead).

## Resolving HP Photosmart 6520 Connectivity Problems

A printer that does not connect is useless. Your HP Photosmart 6520 relies on a stable connection. This can be wireless or via USB. Connection issues prevent printing from your computer or mobile device. Let us look at how to fix these common problems.

### Wireless Connection Drops

Wireless connectivity problems are frequent. Your HP Photosmart 6520 might lose its Wi-Fi connection. This often happens due to network interference or signal weakness. First, restart your printer. Power it off completely, wait 30 seconds, then turn it back on. Next, restart your wireless router. Unplug it from power, wait a minute, then plug it back in. This often clears network glitches.

Ensure your printer is close enough to the router. Walls or other electronic devices can block the signal. Try moving the printer closer to the router temporarily. Also, check your routerâ€™s settings. Ensure it broadcasts on a compatible frequency (2.4 GHz is common for printers). A stable Wi-Fi connection is vital for continuous printing.

### USB Connection Failure

If you use a USB cable, check the cable itself. USB cables can become faulty over time. Try a different USB cable if you have one available. Ensure the cable is plugged firmly into both the printer and your computer. Sometimes, the USB port on your computer can be the problem. Try plugging the cable into a different USB port.

Also, check your computer's device manager. Look for any errors related to the printer. You might need to reinstall the printer drivers. Old or corrupted drivers cause communication issues. You can download the latest drivers from the HP support website. Proper USB connection ensures direct, reliable printing.

### Network Configuration Checks

Sometimes, the issue lies in your network settings. Your Photosmart 6520 needs a valid IP address. You can find this in your printer's network settings menu. Ensure your printer's IP address is on the same network as your computer. If your network uses a static IP setup, make sure the printer's IP is correct.

Firewall settings on your computer can also block printer communication. Temporarily disable your firewall to test if this is the cause. If it works, add an exception for your printer in the firewall settings. For similar troubleshooting steps for other HP printer models, you might find useful information in guides like [HP Deskjet 3755 Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/hp-deskjet-3755-troubleshooting) or [HP Envy 6000 Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/hp-envy-6000-troubleshooting-quick-fixes-for-common-issues). These resources often share common solutions for network and connectivity problems across different HP printer series.

## Tackling Paper Jams and Feeding Problems

Paper jams are one of the most common printer issues. They stop printing immediately and can be frustrating. Your HP Photosmart 6520 might show a paper jam error. This means paper is stuck inside the printer. We will guide you through clearing jams and preventing them.

### Clearing Paper Jams

When a paper jam occurs, the first step is to turn off the printer. Unplug the power cord. This prevents accidental injury and protects the printer. Gently open all access doors. Look for any visible paper. Pull the paper slowly and carefully in the direction of the paper path. Avoid tearing the paper, as small pieces can cause future jams.

Check all areas. This includes the input tray, output tray, and the rear access door. Some Photosmart models have a duplexer or rear access panel that needs checking. Use a flashlight if needed to spot small scraps. Once all paper is removed, close all covers. Plug the printer back in and turn it on. The printer should clear the error.

### Preventing Future Jams

Preventing jams saves you time and frustration. Always use the correct paper type and weight for your HP Photosmart 6520. Refer to your printer manual for paper specifications. Do not overload the paper tray. Overfilling can cause paper to misfeed. My experience tells me too much paper often leads to jams.

Ensure paper is fanned before loading. This prevents sheets from sticking together. Adjust the paper guides snugly against the paper stack. Do not push the guides too tight. Store paper in a dry place to prevent moisture absorption. Moist paper is more likely to jam. Using quality paper also helps prevent jams.

### Addressing Paper Pick-Up Issues

Sometimes, the printer does not pick up paper at all. This is a common feeding problem. The paper rollers might be dirty or worn out. You can try cleaning the paper pick-up rollers. Use a lint-free cloth lightly dampened with distilled water. Gently wipe the rollers, which are often visible in the paper tray area.

Also, ensure the paper is loaded correctly. It should sit flat against the bottom of the tray. The paper guides must be adjusted precisely. If the rollers are very worn, they might need replacement. This usually requires professional service. For general paper handling tips that apply to many HP printers, reviewing basic troubleshooting for other models, such as those covered in [HP OfficeJet Pro 8600 Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/hp-officejet-pro-8600-troubleshooting), can provide additional context.

## Addressing HP Photosmart 6520 Error Messages

Your HP Photosmart 6520 can display various error messages. These messages provide clues about what is wrong. Understanding them helps you fix problems faster. Common errors include 'Paper Jam', 'Ink Cartridge Problem', or 'Printer Offline'. Let us discuss how to handle them.

### Common Error Code Meanings

Each error code points to a specific issue. For example, a 'Paper Jam' message indicates paper stuck inside. 'Ink Cartridge Problem' means a cartridge is not recognized or is faulty. An 'Offline' status means the printer is not communicating with your computer. Always read the message carefully. Your printer's manual lists common error codes and their meanings. I keep my manual handy for this reason.

Some errors might be general. An 'E' followed by a number often appears for hardware issues. If the error persists after basic fixes, search online for that specific code. HP's support website is a good resource. They often provide detailed steps for each error.

A simple reset can often clear many error messages. This process is called a "power cycle." First, turn off your HP Photosmart 6520. Unplug the power cord from the wall outlet. Wait at least 60 seconds. This allows the printer's internal memory to clear completely. Then, plug the power cord back into the wall outlet. Turn the printer on.

This full reset can resolve temporary glitches. It clears cached errors. Many users find this simple step fixes a surprising number of issues. If the error reappears immediately, the problem is more severe. You will need to move to more specific troubleshooting steps.

### Firmware Updates

Outdated firmware can cause various problems. Firmware is the printer's internal software. HP regularly releases updates. These updates fix bugs and improve performance. Check the HP support website for your Photosmart 6520 model. Download and install any available firmware updates.

Install firmware updates carefully. Follow the instructions precisely. Do not turn off the printer during an update. Doing so can damage the printer. Firmware updates can resolve persistent errors that basic troubleshooting cannot fix. It is a good practice to keep your printer's firmware current. This proactive step can prevent many issues from arising in the first place.

## Ink Cartridge and Supply Related Issues

Ink cartridges are vital for your Photosmart 6520. Problems with cartridges can stop printing entirely. Issues range from cartridges not being recognized to low ink warnings. Understanding how to manage these helps keep your printer running. We will discuss common ink supply problems and their solutions.

### Cartridge Not Recognized

Sometimes, your HP Photosmart 6520 might not recognize a cartridge. This can happen with new or existing cartridges. First, ensure the cartridge is installed correctly. Remove the cartridge and reinsert it firmly until it clicks into place. Make sure you remove any protective tapes or caps from the new cartridge. Sometimes, debris on the cartridge contacts causes this error.

Gently wipe the copper-colored electrical contacts on the cartridge. Use a lint-free cloth. Also, clean the contacts inside the printer where the cartridge connects. Power cycle the printer after cleaning. If the issue persists, try a different cartridge if available. A faulty cartridge can be the cause. My own printer occasionally has this issue, and a simple reinstallation usually fixes it.

### Low Ink Warnings and Replacements

Your printer provides low ink warnings. These warnings help you prepare for replacement. Do not wait until the cartridge is completely empty to replace it. Running a cartridge completely dry can sometimes damage the printhead. When you receive a low ink warning, order a new cartridge.

Replacing cartridges is straightforward. Open the access door to the cartridge carriage. Remove the old cartridge by pressing the tab or lever. Unwrap the new cartridge. Insert it into the correct slot. Push until it clicks securely. Your Photosmart 6520 should then recognize the new cartridge. This process is similar for most HP Photosmart models.

### Using Genuine HP Cartridges

HP printers work best with genuine HP ink cartridges. These cartridges are designed specifically for your printer. They ensure optimal print quality and reliability. Using third-party or refilled cartridges can cause issues. These can include poor print quality, clogging, or even printer damage. I have seen instances where non-HP ink clogged printheads permanently.

HP does not guarantee the performance of non-HP supplies. While they might seem cheaper, the long-term cost can be higher due to reprints or printer damage. For your Photosmart 6520, stick to genuine HP ink. It helps maintain the printer's health and print quality. This ensures your printer performs as intended for years.
