## Deep Clean Your Maytag Top Load Washer

My Maytag top load washer works hard for me, but sometimes I forget it needs cleaning too. Just like any hardworking appliance, your washing machine can collect dirt, detergent residue, and even mold. This buildup can make your clothes smell less fresh and reduce the machine's efficiency. Learning how to clean your Maytag top load washer regularly keeps it running well. This guide will show you simple steps to deep clean your Maytag top load washer. We will cover everything from the tub to the dispensers, ensuring your laundry comes out truly clean.

### Takeaway:

*   Clean your Maytag washer monthly to prevent odors and residue.
*   Use vinegar, baking soda, or commercial cleaners for the tub.
*   Do not forget to clean dispenser trays and the agitator.
*   Leave the lid open after use to help prevent mold.

A Maytag top load washer needs regular cleaning to remove soap scum, mildew, and mineral deposits. This prevents odors and keeps clothes fresh. You can use simple household items like vinegar and baking soda or a commercial washer cleaner for best results.

### The Importance of Cleaning Your Maytag Top Load Washer

Your Maytag top load washer is a powerful machine. It handles dirty clothes, towels, and bedding day after day. Over time, residue from detergents, fabric softeners, and hard water can build up inside the drum. This buildup creates a film that traps dirt and can lead to unpleasant smells.

If you notice your clothes do not smell as fresh, or if you see visible grime inside the tub, it is time for a deep clean. Neglecting washer cleaning can lead to mold and mildew growth. These can transfer to your laundry, causing skin irritation or even health problems. Regular cleaning ensures your washer works its best. It helps your clothes come out truly clean and fresh every single time. A clean washer also lasts longer, saving you money on repairs.

### Gathering Your Essential Washer Cleaning Supplies

Before you start cleaning your Maytag top load washer, get all your tools ready. You likely have most of these items already in your home. Having everything prepared makes the cleaning process quick and easy. This list includes common household cleaners and a few specialty items you might want.

You will need a few basic cleaning agents. White vinegar is excellent for cutting through soap scum and deodorizing. Baking soda helps absorb odors and acts as a mild abrasive. For tough jobs, a commercial washer cleaner works well. You will also need some cleaning tools. A microfiber cloth or sponge is good for wiping surfaces. An old toothbrush can reach into tight spots and scrub away grime. A bucket or small bowl can hold water for rinsing.

Here is a simple list of what you need:

*   White distilled vinegar
*   Baking soda
*   Optional: Commercial washing machine cleaner (like Affresh or a Maytag-specific cleaner)
*   Microfiber cloths or sponges
*   An old toothbrush
*   A spray bottle (for vinegar solution)
*   Warm water
*   Rubber gloves (to protect your hands)

Having these items ready ensures you can tackle every part of your washer effectively. From the drum to the detergent dispenser, proper tools make the job easier. This preparation sets you up for a successful cleaning session.

### How To Clean Maytag Top Load Washer Tub

Cleaning the washer tub is the most important step for freshness. The tub holds all the water and clothes, so it collects the most residue. You have a few options for cleaning the tub: using natural products like vinegar and baking soda, or a specialized commercial cleaner. Both methods are effective for getting rid of grime and odors.

#### Cleaning with Vinegar and Baking Soda

This method is popular for its natural cleaning power. Vinegar works as a disinfectant and dissolves mineral deposits. Baking soda acts as a mild abrasive and odor absorber. I find this method works wonders for general maintenance.

To start, make sure your washer is empty. Add two cups of white distilled vinegar directly into the detergent dispenser or the tub. Set your washer to the hottest water setting and the largest load size. Let the cycle run for a few minutes to mix the vinegar with water. Then, pause the cycle and let the mixture soak in the tub for about an hour. This soaking time allows the vinegar to break down soap scum and kill mildew.

After soaking, add half a cup of baking soda to the tub. Restart the wash cycle and let it complete. The baking soda will react with the vinegar to create a scrubbing action. Once the cycle finishes, wipe down the inside of the tub with a clean cloth. Pay attention to any remaining residue. Run a quick rinse cycle to flush out any lingering bits. This process leaves your washer tub smelling clean and looking shiny.

#### Using Commercial Washer Cleaners

Many companies make cleaners specifically for washing machines. Brands like Affresh or Maytag's own cleaner are designed to break down buildup. These cleaners often come in tablet form, making them very simple to use. They are a good choice if you prefer a quick and easy solution.

To use a commercial cleaner, simply follow the package directions. Most cleaners require you to place a tablet directly into the empty washer tub. Then, you run a hot water cycle, often a specific "Clean Washer" cycle if your Maytag has one. These cleaners work by dissolving detergent buildup, mold, and mildew. They leave your washer tub sparkling clean. It is a good idea to use these cleaners once a month or every few months, depending on your usage. This helps maintain a fresh and clean machine.

### Cleaning the Detergent Dispenser and Agitator

Many people focus only on the main tub, but other parts of your Maytag top load washer also get dirty. The detergent dispenser and the agitator or impeller often collect residue. Cleaning these parts is key to a truly clean machine and effective laundry cycles. These areas get sticky with old soap and fabric softener, which can lead to clogs and bad smells.

#### Detailing the Detergent Dispenser

The detergent dispenser can become a breeding ground for mold and mildew. This happens because it stays damp and holds small amounts of product. Many Maytag top load washers have removable dispenser trays. This makes cleaning much easier. If your dispenser is removable, take it out first.

Wash the dispenser tray in your sink with warm, soapy water. Use an old toothbrush to scrub away any sticky residue or mold. Pay close attention to corners and crevices where gunk can hide. If the dispenser is not removable, spray a vinegar solution into the compartments. Let it sit for a few minutes. Then, scrub with a toothbrush and wipe clean with a damp cloth. Make sure to rinse thoroughly to remove all cleaning solution. This step ensures your detergent and fabric softener dispense cleanly, preventing new stains on clothes.

#### Maintaining Your Washer Agitator

The agitator is the central part of many Maytag top load washers. It twists back and forth to move clothes through the water. Over time, hair, lint, and detergent residue can build up around its base and under its cap. If your washer has an impeller (a low-profile disc at the bottom), it also needs cleaning. Cleaning the agitator is important because grime here can rub off on your clothes. To access the agitator, you might need to remove a cap or cover. Check your washer's manual for specific instructions on how to do this safely.

Once you have access, wipe down the agitator with a damp cloth. Use your old toothbrush and a vinegar solution to scrub around the base and any grooves. You may find lint or hair wrapped around the base. Remove any foreign objects carefully. If your agitator has a top cap, remove it and clean underneath it too. This area is often overlooked but can harbor a lot of gunk. Rinse the parts you cleaned with water. Put the agitator cap back in place. Regularly cleaning this part helps the machine move clothes freely. It also prevents residue from clinging to your freshly washed items.

### Addressing Washer Odors and Mold Prevention

One of the most common complaints about washing machines is bad smells. These odors come from mold, mildew, and bacteria that thrive in damp environments. If your Maytag top load washer smells musty, it means these microscopic organisms are present. Preventing these odors and controlling mold growth is crucial for a fresh laundry experience.

#### Banishing Musty Washer Smells

A musty smell usually means mold or mildew is growing inside your machine. This can happen in the tub, the dispenser, or even the hoses. The best way to banish these smells is through a thorough cleaning. I find that a combination of vinegar and a hot wash cycle works wonders for this.

First, run a "Clean Washer" cycle with hot water and two cups of white vinegar. If your washer does not have a "Clean Washer" cycle, use the hottest water setting and the largest load size. Let the cycle run fully. After this cycle, if the smell remains, you might need to do a second round with half a cup of baking soda. Sprinkle the baking soda into the empty tub and run another hot cycle. For particularly stubborn smells, you can also consider a commercial washer cleaner. These are designed to kill odor-causing bacteria and fungi. Always remember to wipe down all surfaces after each cleaning. This removes any lingering residue. If you have a persistent problem, learning [how to clean smelly washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-washer) can provide more detailed steps.

#### Preventing Mold and Mildew Buildup

Prevention is always better than cure when it comes to mold. Mold needs moisture to grow. Your Maytag top load washer is a prime spot for it because of constant water exposure. Making small changes in your laundry routine can make a big difference.

Always remove wet laundry from the washer immediately after the cycle finishes. Do not let damp clothes sit inside the machine. After each wash, leave the washer lid open for a few hours. This allows the interior of the tub to air dry completely. Good airflow discourages mold and mildew from taking hold. Wipe down the inside of the lid and around the top edge of the tub after each use. This removes excess moisture. If you live in a humid area, consider using a dehumidifier in your laundry room. You can also run a monthly "Clean Washer" cycle with vinegar or a commercial cleaner as a preventative measure. This proactive approach keeps your Maytag washer fresh and odor-free. It protects your clothes from unwanted musty smells.

### Maintaining Your Washer's Exterior and Hoses

While internal cleaning is essential, the outside of your Maytag top load washer also needs attention. The exterior can gather dust, grime, and detergent drips. The hoses, though often hidden, are vital for water flow and also need periodic checks. Regular cleaning of these external parts ensures the whole machine looks good and functions safely.

#### Cleaning the Washer Exterior

The exterior of your washer is usually easy to clean. Dust and dirt can settle on the top and sides. Detergent or fabric softener drips can leave sticky marks. A quick wipe-down keeps your laundry room looking tidy.

Use a soft, damp cloth and mild all-purpose cleaner. Wipe down the control panel, the lid, and the sides of the machine. Be careful not to spray water directly onto the control panel, as this can damage electronics. If you have stainless steel surfaces, use a cleaner designed for stainless steel to avoid streaks. Pay attention to the areas around the detergent dispenser where drips often occur. This regular external cleaning prevents grime from building up and makes your washer look new. It also makes your laundry space a more pleasant area.

#### Inspecting and Cleaning Hoses and Drains

The water inlet hoses and the drain hose are critical for your washer's operation. Over time, inlet hoses can crack or wear out, leading to leaks. The drain hose can get clogged with lint or other debris. Regularly checking these parts helps prevent costly water damage.

First, visually inspect the inlet hoses at the back of your washer. Look for any cracks, bulges, or signs of rust around the connections. Maytag recommends replacing rubber hoses every five years. If you have braided stainless steel hoses, they are more durable but still need checking. Turn off the water supply before disconnecting hoses if you need to replace them. For the drain hose, ensure it is not kinked or blocked. You can sometimes gently pull it out from the wall drain to check for large obstructions near the end. If your washer's drain seems slow, or if water is backing up, it might be time to clean your washer drain. We have a guide on [how to clean washer drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washer-drain) that provides detailed steps. Keeping these components clean and in good repair ensures proper water flow and drainage. It prevents messy laundry room floods.

### Regular Maintenance Tips for Longevity

Cleaning your Maytag top load washer is not a one-time event. Regular maintenance helps keep it in top condition for years. Small habits can make a big difference in preventing problems and extending your appliance's life. Think of it as preventative care for your hard-working laundry partner.

#### Establishing a Cleaning Schedule

Consistency is key for a clean washer. I recommend setting up a regular cleaning schedule. A good rule of thumb is to run a "Clean Washer" cycle once a month. If you do a lot of laundry, or if you live in an area with hard water, you might need to clean it more often.

Mark it on your calendar or set a reminder on your phone. This makes sure you do not forget. Between monthly deep cleans, a quick wipe-down of the dispenser and tub rim after each use can prevent buildup. This proactive approach keeps odors at bay. It also prevents dirt from accumulating, making your monthly deep clean easier. Skipping regular cleaning can lead to stubborn grime and unpleasant smells. This schedule helps you avoid those problems.

#### Best Practices for Daily Use

How you use your Maytag top load washer daily affects its cleanliness and lifespan. Simple habits can reduce wear and tear and minimize residue buildup. These small actions contribute to a healthier washing machine.

*   **Use the Right Amount of Detergent:** More detergent does not mean cleaner clothes. Too much detergent creates excessive suds and residue. This leaves a film inside the washer tub. Follow the detergent manufacturer's recommendations. Many modern high-efficiency (HE) washers require very little soap.
*   **Use HE Detergent for HE Washers:** If your Maytag washer is an HE model, always use HE detergent. HE detergents are low-sudsing and designed for less water usage. Using regular detergent in an HE washer causes too many suds, leading to residue and potential machine issues.
*   **Remove Clothes Promptly:** As mentioned earlier, take clothes out of the washer as soon as the cycle finishes. This prevents moisture from getting trapped, which encourages mold and mildew growth.
*   **Leave the Lid Open:** After removing laundry, leave the washer lid open for a few hours or until the interior is completely dry. This airflow helps dry out the drum. It stops mold and mildew from forming.
*   **Wipe Down After Each Use:** Quickly wipe the inside of the lid and the top rim of the tub. This removes any standing water or detergent splashes.

By following these simple best practices, you can significantly reduce the need for intensive cleaning. You will also keep your Maytag top load washer performing at its peak. This helps your clothes stay fresh and keeps your appliance running efficiently for many years.
