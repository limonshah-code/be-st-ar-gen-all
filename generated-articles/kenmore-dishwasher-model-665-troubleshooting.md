## Understanding Your Kenmore 665 Dishwasher

Kenmore appliances are known for their reliability. The Model 665 dishwasher is a common household unit. It performs well when maintained properly. However, like any appliance, it can develop issues over time.

Before you begin any troubleshooting, prioritize safety. Always disconnect power to the dishwasher. Unplug it from the wall outlet. If your dishwasher is hardwired, turn off the circuit breaker. This prevents electric shock. You should also turn off the water supply valve. This prevents water leaks while you work.

### Essential Safety First Steps

Before you even think about opening your dishwasher, take a moment for safety. Power is a serious hazard. Water can create a messy situation. I always make sure the power is off at the breaker. I also close the water supply valve.

*   **Unplug the Dishwasher:** Find the power cord and pull it from the wall.
*   **Turn Off Breaker:** If hardwired, go to your home's electrical panel. Find the circuit breaker labeled for the dishwasher and flip it off.
*   **Close Water Supply Valve:** This valve is usually located under the sink or behind the dishwasher. Turn it clockwise until it stops.

Understanding basic dishwasher components helps in troubleshooting. The Kenmore 665 typically has a wash motor, drain pump, heating element, and control panel. It also uses a filter system and spray arms. Familiarizing yourself with these parts makes diagnostics easier. Many problems stem from blockages or electrical failures in these areas. Knowing where to look saves time and effort.

## Common Power and Start-Up Issues with Kenmore 665

Is your Kenmore 665 dishwasher silent when you press the start button? No power is a common frustration. This can stem from simple electrical issues or component failures. Checking the power source is always the first step.

### Dishwasher Not Turning On

When your dishwasher does not turn on, start at the power source. First, check the power cord. Make sure it is plugged in fully. Sometimes, a loose plug is all it takes. Then, check your home's circuit breaker. A tripped breaker means the circuit overloaded. Reset the breaker by flipping it completely off, then back on.

If the breaker trips immediately, there is an electrical short. This needs professional help. If power is good, check the door latch. The dishwasher will not start if the door is not shut correctly. Close the door firmly. Listen for a click from the latch mechanism.

### Lights Flashing or No Response

Flashing lights on your Kenmore 665 often indicate an issue. These are error codes. The specific flash pattern tells you the problem. Consult your owner's manual for code interpretations. A lack of any response could mean a control board issue. It could also point to a faulty door latch switch.

The door latch switch sends a signal to the control board. If this switch is broken, the dishwasher thinks the door is open. Therefore, it will not start a cycle. Testing the door latch switch usually involves a multimeter. If it shows no continuity when the door is closed, replace it. Sometimes, simply cleaning the latch mechanism helps. Debris can prevent it from engaging fully.

*   **Check Power Cord:** Ensure it is securely plugged into the outlet.
*   **Inspect Circuit Breaker:** Reset any tripped breakers in your electrical panel.
*   **Verify Door Latch:** Close the dishwasher door firmly. The latch must click into place.
*   **Examine Control Lock:** Some models have a "control lock" feature. Make sure it is not engaged.
*   **Consult Manual for Error Codes:** Flashing lights often point to specific problems. Your owner's manual explains these patterns.

A faulty control board is less common but possible. If all other checks fail, the control board might be bad. Replacing a control board is more complex. It often requires a service technician. Always eliminate simpler issues first.

## Kenmore 665 Dishwasher Not Draining Water

Finding standing water in the bottom of your Kenmore 665 is a common problem. This indicates a draining issue. Several components work together to remove water. A blockage or malfunction in any of these parts can stop the draining process.

### Clogged Drain Filter and Sump Area

The most common cause of poor drainage is a clogged filter. Food particles and debris accumulate here. Your Kenmore 665 has a filter at the bottom of the tub. This filter traps large food bits. If it gets too dirty, water cannot pass through. This prevents proper draining.

To clean the filter:
1.  Remove the lower dish rack.
2.  Locate the filter assembly. It might be a two-part system.
3.  Twist or pull to remove the filter.
4.  Rinse it under running water. Use a soft brush to remove stuck-on food.
5.  Check the sump area below the filter. Clear out any debris found there.
6.  Reinstall the filter correctly.

Regular cleaning of your dishwasher's filter is vital. I find that a quick rinse after every few loads prevents many drainage issues. For more detailed steps on keeping your dishwasher clean, you can refer to [how to clean Kenmore dishwasher filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-kenmore-dishwasher-filter).

### Issues with the Drain Hose

The drain hose carries water from the dishwasher to your sink drain or garbage disposal. This hose can become kinked or clogged. A kink stops water flow. Debris, grease, or small objects can also block it.
To check the drain hose:
1.  Pull the dishwasher out slightly if needed to access the hose.
2.  Inspect the entire length of the hose for kinks. Straighten any you find.
3.  Disconnect the hose from both the dishwasher and the sink/disposal.
4.  Look inside the hose for blockages. You can use a long brush or snake.
5.  Also, check the air gap (if present) on your sink. This prevents drain water from flowing back into the dishwasher. It can get clogged too.

If you suspect a clog in the drain, consider learning [how to clean dishwasher drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-drain). This knowledge helps prevent future drainage problems.

### Faulty Drain Pump

If the filter and hose are clear, the drain pump might be faulty. The drain pump pushes water out of the dishwasher. You can usually hear it activate during the drain cycle. If you hear nothing, the pump might not be working. A humming noise without water movement suggests a jammed impeller inside the pump.

*   **Test the Pump:** With power off, access the drain pump. It's usually located at the bottom of the dishwasher.
*   **Check for Obstructions:** Remove any small objects stuck in the impeller.
*   **Test for Continuity:** Use a multimeter to check the pump motor for continuity. If it shows no continuity, the pump needs replacement.

Replacing a drain pump can be a moderate repair. It involves disconnecting water lines and electrical wires. If you are not comfortable doing this yourself, consider calling a professional.

## Dishes Not Getting Clean in Kenmore Model 665

One of the most frustrating Kenmore 665 dishwasher problems is dirty dishes after a cycle. The whole point of a dishwasher is clean dishes. Several factors contribute to poor cleaning performance. These include improper water distribution, detergent issues, or heating problems.

### Inspecting Spray Arms

The spray arms distribute water throughout the dishwasher tub. They have small holes that spray water at high pressure. If these holes get clogged, water flow is restricted. This leaves dishes dirty. Food particles, mineral deposits, or even small labels can block the holes.

*   **Remove Spray Arms:** Unclip or unscrew the upper and lower spray arms.
*   **Clean Holes:** Use a toothpick or small wire to clear out each hole.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the spray arms under running water to flush out debris.
*   **Check for Cracks:** Inspect the arms for any cracks or damage. Damaged arms need replacement.

I make it a habit to check the spray arms whenever I clean the filter. It just takes a few seconds and makes a big difference.

### Detergent Dispenser Malfunction

The detergent dispenser releases soap at the correct time in the cycle. If it does not open fully, or at all, dishes will not get clean. Detergent can clump up inside, or the dispenser door might stick.

*   **Check for Blockages:** Ensure the dispenser cup is clean and dry before adding detergent. Hardened detergent can prevent the door from opening.
*   **Test the Latch:** Manually open and close the dispenser door. It should move freely.
*   **Examine Solenoid:** On some models, a solenoid opens the dispenser. If it's faulty, the door won't open. This often requires replacement.

Ensure you are using the correct type and amount of detergent. Old or clumpy detergent may not dissolve properly.

### Water Temperature and Heating Element

Hot water is essential for cleaning and sanitizing dishes. If your Kenmore 665 dishwasher is not heating water, dishes will not come out clean. The heating element is responsible for heating the water. It also helps dry the dishes.

*   **Check Water Heater:** Ensure your home's water heater is set to at least 120°F (49°C).
*   **Test Heating Element:** With power off, locate the heating element at the bottom of the tub. Use a multimeter to check for continuity. If there is no continuity, the element is bad. Replace it.
*   **Inspect Thermostat:** A faulty thermostat might prevent the heating element from turning on. Test it for continuity as well.

If your dishes are still dirty, you might also consider general cleaning practices for your dishwasher. A thorough cleaning can remove built-up grime affecting performance.

## Kenmore 665 Dishwasher Leaking Water

A leaky dishwasher is a major concern. Water leaks can damage your floors and cabinets. When your Kenmore 665 leaks, act quickly. Pinpointing the source of the leak is crucial. Leaks usually come from the door, hoses, or pump seal.

### Door Seal (Gasket) Issues

The door gasket creates a watertight seal when the door closes. Over time, this rubber seal can crack, tear, or become brittle. It can also become dirty with food particles or mold. This prevents a tight seal, leading to leaks.

*   **Inspect the Gasket:** Open the dishwasher door and carefully examine the entire length of the gasket. Look for cracks, tears, or signs of wear.
*   **Clean the Gasket:** Use a damp cloth and mild detergent to clean any debris or grime from the gasket. Ensure no food particles are lodged in it.
*   **Adjust Door Latch:** Sometimes, the door latch itself might be loose or misaligned. This prevents the door from pressing firmly against the gasket. Adjust the latch if necessary.
*   **Replace Gasket:** If the gasket is damaged, it needs replacement. This is a straightforward repair. You can usually pull the old one out and push the new one into its channel.

For general cleanliness, especially around seals where mold can grow, tips on [how to clean mold in dishwasher](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-in-dishwasher) can be helpful.

### Hose Connections and Inlet Valve

Your dishwasher has several hoses. These include the water inlet hose and the drain hose. Loose connections or damaged hoses can cause leaks. The water inlet valve controls water flow into the dishwasher. If this valve is faulty, it can leak.

*   **Check Inlet Hose:** Look under the sink or behind the dishwasher. Ensure the inlet hose is securely connected to both the water supply and the dishwasher. Check for cracks in the hose itself.
*   **Examine Drain Hose:** Inspect the drain hose for any damage. Ensure its connections are tight at both ends.
*   **Inspect Water Inlet Valve:** This valve is usually located near the bottom of the dishwasher, where the water supply line connects. Look for drips around the valve body or its connections. If water drips when the dishwasher is off, the valve is likely faulty and needs replacement.

Leaks from the bottom of the dishwasher often point to the water inlet valve or the circulation pump seal.

### Faulty Pump or Motor Seal

The circulation pump pushes water through the spray arms. The drain pump removes water. Both have seals to prevent leaks. Over time, these seals can wear out. A leaking pump or motor seal usually results in water pooling under the dishwasher.

*   **Identify Leak Source:** Trace the water leak. If it comes from underneath the appliance, it often points to a pump or motor seal.
*   **Inspect Components:** Accessing these parts often requires pulling the dishwasher out and tilting it. Look for water stains or drips around the pump housing or motor shaft.
*   **Replace Seals/Components:** If a seal is worn, replace it. In some cases, the entire pump assembly might need replacement if the leak is severe or the pump is also malfunctioning.

Repairing pump leaks can be complex. It often involves disassembling parts of the dishwasher. If you are unsure, consider professional help.

## Unusual Noises from Your Kenmore 665 Dishwasher

Dishwashers make some noise during operation. You expect to hear water spraying and draining. However, grinding, humming, or rattling noises indicate a problem. Pinpointing the sound's origin helps diagnose the issue.

### Grinding or Squealing Sounds

A grinding noise often indicates something is obstructing the wash impeller or drain pump. Small bits of food, broken glass, or other foreign objects can get caught. A squealing sound might point to a failing motor bearing.

*   **Check Sump Area and Impeller:** With power off, remove the lower rack and filter. Look into the sump area at the bottom of the tub. Clear any debris that might be interfering with the impeller.
*   **Inspect Drain Pump:** Access the drain pump (usually from underneath the dishwasher). Check its impeller for obstructions.
*   **Motor Bearings:** If the sound is a high-pitched squeal, it might be the wash motor's bearings wearing out. This is a more involved repair. It may require replacing the motor assembly.

I once heard a terrible grinding from my dishwasher. It turned out to be a small piece of ceramic from a broken plate stuck in the drain pump. Clearing it solved the problem immediately.

### Humming But No Water Movement

If you hear a humming sound but no water is circulating or draining, the motor might be trying to run but is jammed. This often points to the wash motor or drain pump being seized. It could also mean a clogged pump impeller.

*   **Check Wash Motor:** With power off, access the wash motor. Try to manually turn the impeller if possible. It should move freely.
*   **Inspect Drain Pump:** As mentioned earlier, check the drain pump for obstructions. A seized impeller prevents water movement.
*   **Capacitor Failure:** Some motors use a start capacitor. A faulty capacitor can cause the motor to hum but not start. Test the capacitor with a multimeter if you suspect this.

### Rattling or Thumping Noises

Rattling or thumping noises are often due to items inside the dishwasher. Sometimes, dishes or utensils shift during the cycle. They might block the spray arms.

*   **Load Dishes Correctly:** Ensure dishes are properly loaded. Nothing should hang below the racks. This prevents interference with the spray arms.
*   **Check Spray Arms:** Make sure the spray arms spin freely by hand. If they hit dishes or themselves, rearrange the load. Also, check if the spray arms are loose on their mounts. Tighten them if needed.
*   **Loose Parts:** Occasionally, a loose mounting screw or clip inside the dishwasher can cause rattling. Carefully inspect the interior for any parts that might have come loose.

Another consideration for rattling is the sound insulation. Sometimes, older models might have deteriorated insulation, allowing more operational noise.

## Addressing Error Codes on Kenmore 665 Dishwashers

While many Kenmore 665 models might not have advanced digital displays, they often communicate issues through flashing lights or specific indicator patterns. Understanding these can help you diagnose problems without a manual.

### Interpreting Flashing Lights

Older Kenmore 665 dishwashers typically use sequence of flashing lights. Different lights (e.g., "Wash," "Dry," "Clean") may flash in a pattern. This pattern corresponds to an error code. For example, the "Clean" light flashing repeatedly might indicate a specific fault.

*   **Count the Flashes:** Carefully observe which lights flash and how many times they flash. Note the pause between sequences.
*   **Consult Your Manual:** The owner's manual is your primary resource for interpreting these codes. It provides a chart linking flash patterns to specific issues.
*   **Common Patterns:** Without a manual, look for common issues associated with general fault indicators. These often relate to water supply, drainage, or heating.

If you no longer have your manual, Kenmore's website or online appliance forums often host digital copies or user-contributed interpretations of these codes for Model 665.

### Common Error Indicators and Solutions

Even without specific digital codes, common operational issues can manifest as "error indicators."

*   **No Water/Low Water Pressure:** If the dishwasher starts but then stops or just hums, it might not be getting enough water. Check the water supply valve. Ensure it is fully open. Also, inspect the inlet hose for kinks.
*   **Drainage Issues:** If the cycle completes but leaves standing water, the drain system has a fault. This ties back to clogged filters, drain hoses, or a faulty drain pump.
*   **Heating Element Failure:** Dishes coming out cold and wet, or the dishwasher stopping mid-cycle, can indicate a heating problem. The heating element, thermostat, or thermal fuse might be bad.
*   **Door Latch Problem:** If the dishwasher lights up but won't start any cycle, the door latch sensor might be faulty. The machine thinks the door is open.

A simple power cycle can sometimes clear minor glitches. Unplug the dishwasher for 5-10 minutes. Then plug it back in. This often resets the control board. If the issue persists, you must investigate the specific component.

### Understanding the Control Board

The control board is the "brain" of your Kenmore 665. It receives signals from various sensors and sends commands to components. If the control board malfunctions, it can cause various unpredictable issues. These might include incorrect cycle progression or unexplained errors.

*   **Signs of a Faulty Board:** Intermittent problems, specific functions not working, or illogical error codes can point to a board issue.
*   **Resetting the Board:** As mentioned, a power cycle can reset it.
*   **Professional Diagnosis:** Diagnosing a bad control board accurately requires advanced testing. This is usually a job for an experienced technician. Replacing a control board is also an expensive repair.

Before assuming a control board issue, rule out all other possibilities. Most problems are mechanical or related to individual components.

## Maintaining Your Kenmore 665 for Longevity

Regular maintenance extends the life of your Kenmore 665 dishwasher. It also prevents many common problems. A clean dishwasher performs better. It smells better too. Simple care routines save you time and money on repairs.

### Regular Cleaning Routines

Cleaning your dishwasher is not just for appearances. It ensures efficient operation. Food particles, grease, and mineral deposits build up over time. This can clog filters, spray arms, and hoses.

*   **Filter Cleaning:** As discussed, clean the filter regularly. I typically do this every week or two. Remove the filter, rinse it under hot water, and scrub away any debris.
*   **Spray Arm Cleaning:** Periodically check and clean the spray arm holes. Use a toothpick to clear blockages.
*   **Door Gasket Cleaning:** Wipe down the door seal and edges with a damp cloth. This removes food grime and prevents mold buildup. For more details on maintaining overall cleanliness, check out [how to clean Kenmore dishwasher](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-kenmore-dishwasher).

Regular cleaning helps your dishwasher perform optimally. It also prevents the growth of mold and mildew, which can cause unpleasant odors.

### Preventing Hard Water Build-Up

Hard water leaves mineral deposits inside your dishwasher. This white, chalky residue can affect performance. It can clog parts and reduce heating efficiency.

*   **Vinegar Rinse:** Place a cup of white vinegar in a top rack-safe bowl. Run an empty, hot water cycle. Vinegar helps dissolve mineral buildup. You can learn more about this method in [how to clean dishwasher with vinegar](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dishwasher-with-vinegar).
*   **Citric Acid:** Use a dishwasher cleaner containing citric acid. This is effective against hard water stains.
*   **Rinse Aid:** Using a rinse aid helps water sheet off dishes. This reduces water spots and mineral buildup on the dishwasher interior.

If you live in an area with very hard water, consider a water softener for your home. This protects all your water-using appliances.

### Proper Loading Techniques

How you load your dishwasher impacts its cleaning performance. Overloading or incorrect placement prevents water and detergent from reaching all surfaces.

*   **Don't Overload:** Give dishes space. Water needs to circulate freely.
*   **Place Dishes Correctly:**
    *   **Bottom Rack:** Place large, heavily soiled items here. Face soiled surfaces towards the spray arm.
    *   **Top Rack:** Cups, glasses, and smaller bowls go here. Invert them to prevent water pooling.
    *   **Silverware Basket:** Load forks and spoons with handles down. Knives should be handle up for safety. Do not nest items together.
*   **Avoid Blocking Dispenser:** Ensure no tall items block the detergent dispenser door.
*   **Pre-Scrape, Don't Pre-Rinse:** Scrape off large food particles. Most modern dishwashers, including the Kenmore 665, are designed to handle food residue. Excessive pre-rinsing wastes water and can confuse the dishwasher's soil sensors.

Following these tips improves cleaning efficiency. It also reduces wear on your Kenmore 665 dishwasher.
