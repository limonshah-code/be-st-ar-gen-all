## Solving Common Unitron Hearing Aid Issues

Having trouble with your Unitron hearing aids can feel isolating. Perhaps they are quiet, making strange noises, or simply do not turn on. These small devices play a big role in your daily life. When they do not work right, it affects your ability to connect with others. Knowing how to perform basic **Unitron hearing aids troubleshooting** can often fix many problems quickly. This guide helps you identify and solve common issues. We discuss everything from simple battery checks to advanced care tips.

I know how frustrating it is when your hearing aids act up. I want to help you get clear sound back. We will look at common sound problems, connectivity issues, and ways to keep your devices in top shape. By the end, you will feel more confident handling most minor Unitron hearing aid problems yourself.

### Takeaway

*   Check batteries and charge levels first for most issues.

Many common Unitron hearing aid issues stem from low batteries, earwax blockages, or improper fit. First, ensure your device has power. Then, carefully clean its components, checking for debris in the speaker or microphone ports. Finally, adjust the fit to stop feedback. These steps often restore function.

## Understanding Your Unitron Hearing Aids

Unitron hearing aids use advanced technology to improve your hearing. They come in many styles, like Behind-The-Ear (BTE) and In-The-Ear (ITE) models. Each style has specific parts that help it work. Knowing these parts helps you when you need to fix a problem. For example, BTE aids have a thin tube and a dome or earmold that sits in your ear. ITE aids fit completely inside your ear canal. Both types have microphones, a processor, a receiver, and a battery compartment.

Proper care for these devices is important. Unitron designs their hearing aids to be durable. Still, they are sensitive electronic devices. Moisture, earwax, and dirt can cause problems. Understanding the parts and how they work helps you keep them clean. It also helps you spot issues early. I recommend you look at your hearing aids every day. This helps you notice small problems before they become big ones. A quick check can save you a trip to the audiologist.

### Key Parts to Know

Your Unitron hearing aid has several key parts. The microphone picks up sound. The processor makes the sound clearer. The receiver sends the sound into your ear. The battery provides power. Many models also have a wax guard, which protects the receiver from earwax. For BTE models, the thin tube carries sound from the aid to the ear. The dome or earmold fits inside your ear canal. ITE models have a small vent for air and a pull string to remove them.

Knowing these parts helps you troubleshoot. If your sound is weak, the receiver or wax guard might be blocked. If the aid feels uncomfortable, the dome or earmold might not fit right. Look at your device often. Identify where each part is. This helps you clean it correctly. It also helps you know what to look for when a problem happens.

### Basic Daily Care

Daily care for your Unitron hearing aids is simple. Wipe them with a soft, dry cloth each night. This removes moisture and dirt. For BTE models, check the tube and dome for wax. For ITE models, check the wax guard. Many audiologists provide small cleaning tools. These tools help remove wax from tiny openings. Always store your hearing aids in their charging case or a dry box. This protects them from moisture. Never use water or harsh chemicals. These can damage the electronics.

I find that a quick cleaning each night prevents many problems. It only takes a minute. This routine keeps your hearing aids working well. It also extends their life. Think of it like brushing your teeth. Small daily effort leads to big long-term benefits. Regular cleaning helps prevent common issues that require **Unitron hearing aids troubleshooting**.

## Addressing Sound Problems with Unitron Hearing Aids

One of the most common issues people face is problems with sound quality. Your Unitron hearing aid might have no sound, weak sound, or distorted sound. This can be very frustrating. Luckily, many sound issues have simple solutions. We can often fix these problems right at home. I always start by checking the power source. Then, I look for blockages. These two steps solve a lot of problems.

If your hearing aid is completely silent, it often means no power or a total blockage. If the sound is weak, it might be low battery or partial blockage. Distorted sound can point to moisture or a damaged component. Do not worry; we will go through each step. I will show you what to check first. This helps you get your clear sound back quickly.

### Check Battery Levels

First, check the battery. For rechargeable Unitron hearing aids, place them in the charger. Make sure they are seated correctly. The indicator lights should show they are charging. Give them a few minutes. For disposable battery aids, open the battery door. Remove the old battery. Put in a fresh, new battery. Make sure the plus (+) side faces the correct way. Close the battery door fully. A common mistake is putting the battery in backward.

Sometimes, a battery is low even if it shows some power. Replace it if you are unsure. Rechargeable batteries can also lose their charge capacity over time. If your aid does not hold a charge like it used to, the battery might be old. Most rechargeable batteries last several years. If your aids are old, the internal battery might need professional replacement. This is a crucial step in **Unitron hearing aids troubleshooting**.

### Inspect for Blockages (Wax, Debris)

Earwax is a hearing aidâ€™s biggest enemy. It can block the sound output. Check the end of your hearing aid that goes into your ear. For BTE models, look at the dome or earmold. For ITE models, look directly at the speaker or wax guard. You might see visible earwax or debris. Use the small cleaning tool your audiologist gave you. Gently brush away any wax. You may also need to change the wax guard. This is a tiny filter that stops wax from entering the receiver. Your audiologist can show you how to do this.

If the sound tube on your BTE aid is hard or cracked, it can also affect sound. Hard tubes should be replaced. You can often get new tubes from your audiologist. Clogged tubes can be cleaned with a small wire. Be careful not to puncture them. Keeping your hearing aids clean prevents most sound issues. For more tips on maintaining cleanliness, you might find guides on [how to clean Widex hearing aids](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-widex-hearing-aids) helpful, as many cleaning principles apply across brands.

### Adjust Volume Settings

Sometimes, the sound issue is as simple as the volume setting. Your Unitron hearing aid might have a physical volume button. It could also have controls through the Remote Plus app on your phone. Check both. Make sure the volume is turned up enough. You might have accidentally lowered it. If you use the app, open it and see the current volume level. Adjust it as needed.

Also, check if your hearing aid is in the right program. Most Unitron aids have multiple programs for different listening environments. For example, one program for quiet settings and another for noisy places. You might be in a program that reduces background noise too much, making overall sound seem weak. Cycle through the programs. See if a different program gives you better sound. This is an easy step in **Unitron hearing aids troubleshooting**.

### Select Proper Program

Your Unitron hearing aids offer different programs. These programs are set by your audiologist. They help you hear better in various situations. You might have a program for quiet conversations, one for noisy restaurants, or even one for listening to music. If you are in the wrong program, sound might seem off. For example, using the "noisy environment" program in a quiet room might make voices sound too soft.

Use the program button on your hearing aid or the Remote Plus app. Cycle through the available programs. Listen to how the sound changes. Select the program that gives you the clearest and most natural sound for your current environment. Often, changing the program solves issues of clarity or volume. It is a quick check to ensure your hearing aids are set up correctly for your needs.

## Resolving Connectivity and App Issues

Many modern Unitron hearing aids connect to smartphones. They use Bluetooth for streaming audio or for control through the Remote Plus app. Connectivity issues can prevent you from using these features. This can be frustrating, especially if you rely on your phone to adjust settings or stream calls. Common problems include aids not pairing, or the app not working correctly. I have found that restarting devices often helps.

Bluetooth connections can sometimes drop. This happens with any electronic device. The good news is that these problems are usually temporary. You can often fix them yourself. We will cover steps to re-establish connections. We will also look at basic app troubleshooting. Getting your aids connected again will restore full functionality.

### Pairing Problems

If your Unitron hearing aids are not pairing with your phone, try these steps. First, make sure Bluetooth is on on your phone. Then, turn your hearing aids off and on again. This puts them in pairing mode. For rechargeable aids, put them in the charger for a few seconds, then take them out. For battery aids, open and close the battery door. Next, go to your phone's Bluetooth settings. Forget or unpair any old connections to your hearing aids. Then, search for new devices. Select your Unitron aids when they appear.

Sometimes, other Bluetooth devices can interfere. Turn off other nearby Bluetooth devices if you are having trouble. Also, ensure your phone's software is up to date. An old operating system can cause connectivity issues. If you still have trouble, try pairing with a different phone to see if the issue is with your phone or the hearing aids. Troubleshooting connectivity issues with your Unitron aids is similar to resolving problems with other brands. You might find general guidance on [Starkey hearing aid troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/starkey-hearing-aid-troubleshooting) useful, as Bluetooth principles are universal.

### App Freezing or Crashing

The Unitron Remote Plus app lets you control your hearing aids. If the app freezes, crashes, or will not open, try these fixes. First, close the app completely. On iPhones, swipe up from the bottom and swipe the app away. On Android, go to recent apps and swipe it away. Then, reopen the app. Often, this simple restart clears temporary glitches.

If restarting the app does not work, try restarting your phone. Turn your phone off completely, then turn it back on. This refreshes its system. If the problem continues, check for app updates. Go to your phone's app store. See if there is a new version of the Remote Plus app. Updates often fix bugs. As a last resort, uninstall the app, then reinstall it. This clears all app data and gives you a fresh start. While Unitron uses Remote Plus, many principles of app troubleshooting are similar across platforms. For instance, general tips found in a [Thrive hearing app troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/thrive-hearing-app-troubleshooting) guide could offer relevant insights for app-related issues.

## Managing Feedback and Whistling

Hearing aids can sometimes make a whistling sound. This is called feedback. It happens when sound from the hearing aidâ€™s receiver leaks out of the ear and is picked up by the microphone. The microphone then re-amplifies it, creating a loop. This sound can be annoying for you and those around you. It is a common problem, but often easy to fix.

Feedback usually means something is not right with how the hearing aid sits in your ear. It could also mean the volume is too high for your current fit. Identifying the cause helps you stop the whistle. We will look at proper fit, volume, and even earwax. These are the main reasons feedback occurs.

### Proper Fit of Hearing Aid

A good fit is key to stopping feedback. Your Unitron hearing aid needs to sit snugly in your ear. If it is too loose, sound can escape. For BTE aids, make sure the dome or earmold fits well inside your ear canal. Try a different size dome if yours feels too loose. Domes come in various sizes. A larger dome might create a better seal. If you have an earmold, ensure it is seated fully. Push it gently into place.

For ITE aids, ensure the device is pushed in all the way. Sometimes, just repositioning the aid stops the whistle. If your ear canal shape has changed, your current dome or earmold might no longer fit. Weight changes can affect ear shape. If the problem continues, your audiologist can check the fit. They can order a new earmold if needed. A proper fit is essential for preventing feedback and ensuring optimal sound quality.

### Volume Adjustment

Sometimes, the hearing aid volume is simply too high. If the volume is set higher than your ear can comfortably contain the sound, it will leak out. This creates feedback. Try lowering the volume slightly. See if the whistling stops. You can do this using the physical buttons on your Unitron aid or through the Remote Plus app.

It is a good habit to start with a lower volume. Then, slowly increase it until sounds are clear and comfortable. Do not crank the volume up instantly. Find the sweet spot where you hear well without any whistling. If lowering the volume stops the feedback but makes sounds too soft, your hearing aid may need an adjustment from your audiologist. This might mean you need a gain adjustment.

### Blocked Ear Canal (Wax)

Just like a blocked hearing aid, a blocked ear canal can cause feedback. If your ear canal has too much earwax, it can act like a wall. Sound from your hearing aid bounces off the wax. This sound then goes back into the hearing aid's microphone. This creates the whistling sound. Regularly check your ears for wax buildup.

Never insert cotton swabs or other objects into your ear canal. This can push wax deeper. If you suspect earwax buildup, see a doctor or audiologist. They can safely remove the wax. Once the blockage is gone, the feedback often stops. Maintaining clear ear canals is a critical step in **Unitron hearing aids troubleshooting** for feedback issues.

## Troubleshooting Physical Damage and Wear

Your Unitron hearing aids are designed for daily use. Over time, parts can show wear. Tubes can harden or crack. Domes can tear. Moisture can get inside the device. Physical damage can affect performance. It is important to inspect your aids regularly. Early detection of damage can prevent bigger problems. I often see people ignore small issues until they become major faults.

Identifying physical issues is usually easy. Look closely at all parts. Feel the tubes. Check for discoloration. Addressing these issues promptly can save you money. It also keeps your hearing aids working well. We will discuss what to look for and what steps to take.

### Inspect Tubes and Domes

For BTE Unitron hearing aids, the thin tube and dome are common points of wear. The tube can become stiff, yellow, or crack over time. A stiff tube will not sit properly. A cracked tube allows sound to leak, causing weak sound or feedback. Gently bend the tube. If it feels hard or brittle, it needs replacement. Your audiologist can provide new tubes. Replacing tubes is simple. You can often do it yourself.

The dome, the small silicone piece at the end of the tube, can also tear or become discolored. Check it for rips or holes. A damaged dome will not seal well in your ear. This leads to feedback or poor sound quality. Domes are disposable. You should change them regularly, perhaps every few weeks. Keep a supply of spare domes on hand. This makes it easy to replace them when needed.

### Check for Moisture Damage

Moisture is a common enemy of all electronic devices, including Unitron hearing aids. Sweat, humidity, or accidental exposure to water can cause problems. Symptoms of moisture damage include intermittent sound, distorted sound, or complete failure. Look for any signs of corrosion or moisture inside the battery compartment.

If you suspect moisture, turn the hearing aid off immediately. Remove the battery (if applicable). Place the hearing aids in a drying kit or a dehumidifier overnight. Rice is not recommended, as it can leave dust. A proper drying kit uses a desiccant. These kits draw moisture out of the device. Preventative measures include storing your aids in a dry place. Avoid wearing them in the shower or during heavy rain. If moisture damage is severe, professional repair might be necessary.

### Safe Storage Habits

Proper storage of your Unitron hearing aids plays a big role in their longevity. When you are not wearing them, store them in their charging case. If you have non-rechargeable aids, use a dry storage case. Many audiologists provide these. A drying kit with desiccant pellets is also an excellent option. This helps absorb any moisture that has built up during the day.

Never leave your hearing aids in a hot car. Extreme heat can damage the delicate electronics and batteries. Avoid leaving them in humid places like bathrooms. Keep them away from pets and small children. These simple storage habits protect your investment. They reduce the chances of physical damage or moisture issues. This also reduces the need for frequent **Unitron hearing aids troubleshooting**.

## Advanced Unitron Hearing Aid Troubleshooting Steps

Sometimes, basic steps do not fix the problem. This means you might need to try more advanced troubleshooting. These steps include resetting your hearing aids or knowing when to call a professional. Do not try to open your hearing aid. This can cause more damage. It can also void your warranty. However, a simple reset can often clear internal software glitches.

Knowing when to seek professional help is important. Your audiologist has specialized tools. They have the training to diagnose deeper problems. They can also perform repairs that you cannot do at home. I always advise calling your audiologist if you have tried everything else. They are your best resource for complex issues.

### Performing a Hard Reset

A hard reset can sometimes fix electronic glitches. The method for a hard reset varies by Unitron model. For most rechargeable Unitron hearing aids, placing them in their charging case for at least 6-8 hours will essentially reset them. Make sure the charger is plugged in. This allows them to fully charge and power cycle. For aids with disposable batteries, remove the battery. Leave the battery door open for several minutes, or even overnight. Then, insert a fresh battery and close the door.

This process clears the device's temporary memory. It can resolve software freezes or strange behaviors. If your hearing aid is not responding at all, a hard reset is often the next step after checking the battery. Try this before thinking about sending it for repair.

### When to Seek Professional Help

You have tried all the troubleshooting steps. Your Unitron hearing aids still do not work. This is when you should contact your audiologist. There are specific situations where professional help is necessary:

*   **No sound after all troubleshooting:** If you have checked batteries, cleaned thoroughly, and performed a reset, and still hear nothing.
*   **Persistent feedback:** If the whistling continues even after adjusting fit and volume, and cleaning your ears.
*   **Physical damage:** If you see cracks in the casing, a broken battery door, or major structural issues.
*   **Intermittent problems:** If sound cuts in and out, and it is not a battery issue.
*   **Device not charging:** If your rechargeable hearing aid does not charge when placed in its case.
*   **Unusual noises:** If the hearing aid makes buzzing, crackling, or static noises not related to external sounds.
*   **Worse hearing:** If your hearing seems to have gotten worse, even with the aids, it might mean the aids need re-programming or your hearing has changed.

Your audiologist can run diagnostic tests. They can perform deep cleaning. They can also send the hearing aid for manufacturer repair if needed. Never attempt to disassemble your Unitron hearing aid. This will void the warranty. Getting professional help is the safest and most effective way to resolve complex issues. For issues with other brands, similar professional troubleshooting advice applies, as seen in guides like [Rexton hearing aid troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/rexton-hearing-aid-troubleshooting) or [Kirkland hearing aid troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/kirkland-hearing-aid-troubleshooting).

## Maintaining Your Unitron Hearing Aids for Longevity

Regular maintenance is crucial for the long life of your Unitron hearing aids. Think of them like a car. You would not drive a car without oil changes. Similarly, your hearing aids need ongoing care. This care goes beyond just fixing problems when they happen. It is about preventing them in the first place. I have seen many hearing aids fail prematurely due to lack of care.

Good maintenance habits save you time and money. They keep your hearing aids performing their best. They also ensure you hear clearly every day. We will cover basic cleaning routines, proper storage, and the importance of regular audiologist visits. These steps are simple but very effective.

### Regular Cleaning Practices

Clean your Unitron hearing aids every single day. This is the most important maintenance step. Use the brush and wax pick tool provided by your audiologist. Gently brush away any earwax or debris from the microphone and receiver ports. For BTE models, clean the thin tube and dome. If you use disposable wax guards, change them regularly as instructed by your audiologist. This prevents blockages that can stop sound.

A soft, dry cloth works well for wiping the entire device. Never use alcohol, solvents, or water directly on your hearing aids. Moisture is harmful. Your audiologist can show you the best way to clean your specific model. For detailed visual guides, resources like [how to clean Oticon hearing aids](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-oticon-hearing-aids) often share universal cleaning techniques applicable to many hearing aid types, including Unitron. Consistent cleaning reduces the need for **Unitron hearing aids troubleshooting**.

### Proper Storage

How you store your Unitron hearing aids is just as important as cleaning them. When you are not wearing them, they should be in their charging case (for rechargeable models) or a dedicated storage case with a drying agent (for disposable battery models). The drying agent helps remove any moisture that may have built up throughout the day. This prevents corrosion and electronic failures.

Keep your hearing aids in a cool, dry place. Avoid placing them in bathrooms, near windows, or in direct sunlight. Extreme temperatures, especially heat, can damage the batteries and internal components. Always store them out of reach of children and pets. Dogs, in particular, are known to chew on hearing aids. Establishing good storage habits protects your devices from accidental damage and moisture.

### Scheduled Audiologist Visits

Even with the best home care, regular visits to your audiologist are vital. They can perform a thorough cleaning of your Unitron hearing aids. They have specialized tools that can reach areas you cannot. They also check for internal issues or wear that you might not see. Your audiologist can also test your hearing. This ensures your hearing aids are still providing the correct amplification for your needs. Hearing changes over time.

These visits are also a chance to ask questions. You can discuss any ongoing issues or new concerns. Your audiologist can make fine-tuning adjustments to your hearing aid programs. They can update the software if needed. Think of these visits as routine check-ups for your hearing health and devices. They ensure your Unitron hearing aids continue to provide you with the best possible hearing experience. This proactive approach helps minimize the need for unexpected **Unitron hearing aids troubleshooting**.
