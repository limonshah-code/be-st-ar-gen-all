## How To Take Water Filter Out Of Frigidaire Refrigerator

Have you ever wondered about the taste of your tap water? It might seem clean, but unseen impurities can affect its quality. A clean water filter in your Frigidaire refrigerator improves taste and removes contaminants. You get safer, better-tasting water and ice. Knowing how to take water filter out of Frigidaire models is important for this. I find many people do not know where to begin. This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step. You will learn the correct way to remove your Frigidaire water filter. We will cover different filter types and their specific removal methods. This knowledge helps you keep your water supply pure and your appliance working well.

### Takeaway

*   Identify your Frigidaire water filter type and location.
*   Turn off your refrigerator's water supply before starting.
*   Twist, push, or pull filters based on their design.
*   Use a towel to catch drips during removal.
*   Install a bypass plug if you do not replace the filter immediately.
*   Dispose of the old filter properly.

To take a water filter out of a Frigidaire refrigerator, first turn off the water supply to the fridge. Next, locate the filter, which is usually in the top-right, base grille, or inside the fresh food compartment. Depending on the model, twist, push, or pull the filter out. Ensure you have a towel ready for any drips.

### Understanding Your Frigidaire Water Filter System

Frigidaire refrigerators use different water filter designs. Knowing your specific filter type helps you remove it correctly. You will find filter locations vary across models. This variety means one removal method does not fit all Frigidaire refrigerators. I will explain the most common types.

Many Frigidaire side-by-side and French door models have filters inside the fresh food compartment. These often sit in the top-right corner. This location makes them easy to access. You usually find a small cover or a twist-lock mechanism here. Filters like the PureSource3 or PureSource Ultra commonly use this design. They are designed for simple, quick changes.

Some older Frigidaire models, especially top-freezer or certain side-by-side units, place the filter in the base grille. This is at the very bottom of the refrigerator, near the floor. You might need to kneel to reach it. Filters such as the PureSource or PureSource2 are often found here. These filters typically require a push-button release or a quarter-turn twist. This location can be a bit trickier to access.

Identifying your filter type and its location is your first critical step. Check your refrigeratorâ€™s user manual for precise details. The manual offers specific instructions for your exact model. It will show diagrams and filter part numbers. Knowing your filter's model number, like PureSource3, will also guide you. This information ensures you use the correct removal technique.

### Essential Preparations Before Filter Removal

Before you try to take water filter out of Frigidaire models, some simple steps are necessary. Proper preparation prevents messes and ensures a smooth process. Skipping these steps can lead to water spills or damage. I always recommend these actions to make the job easier for you.

First, turn off the water supply to your refrigerator. This is a very important step. You can usually find the shut-off valve behind the refrigerator. It might also be under your sink if your water line is connected there. Turning off the water prevents leaks and sprays when you remove the old filter. I find this step gives peace of mind.

Next, gather a few basic tools and materials. You will need a clean towel or two. These towels will catch any water drips. Even with the water supply off, some residual water stays in the line. A small bucket or shallow pan can also be useful for larger spills. I usually keep a pair of gloves handy. This keeps my hands clean and gives me a better grip.

Make sure you know the exact location of your water filter. As mentioned, filters can be at the top-right inside, in the base grille, or elsewhere. Open the refrigerator door and look around. If you are not sure, consult your refrigerator's manual. The manual gives the exact location and directions.

Finally, have your new filter or a bypass plug ready. If you plan to replace the filter immediately, having the new one nearby speeds up the process. If you are removing the filter for cleaning or will not replace it right away, use a bypass plug. A bypass plug allows water to flow without a filter. It prevents leaks and maintains water flow to the ice maker and dispenser. I find many people forget this small but important item.

### Step-by-Step: Removing a Top-Right Inside Compartment Filter

Many Frigidaire models, especially newer side-by-side and French door refrigerators, have their water filter located in the top-right corner of the fresh food compartment. These are often twist-out filters, like the PureSource3 or PureSource Ultra. This design makes filter changes very simple. I find this type of filter the easiest to remove.

Before you start, make sure you have followed the preparation steps. Turn off the water supply to the refrigerator. Place a towel on the shelf below the filter housing. This catches any water drips. Some water will always remain in the lines.

Now, locate the filter cover or housing in the upper right section. It usually looks like a small plastic cap or a small compartment. You might see a small tab or handle on the filter itself. Push the tab or handle inward or upwards to release the locking mechanism. The exact movement depends on your specific model.

Once released, grasp the end of the filter firmly. Most filters of this type require a quarter-turn counter-clockwise twist. Turn the filter slowly. As you turn it, you will feel it disengage. Pull the filter straight out from its housing. Be ready for a small amount of water to drip. The towel will catch it.

After removing the old filter, inspect the filter housing. Look for any debris or residue. You can wipe it clean with a damp cloth if needed. If you are not installing a new filter immediately, insert the bypass plug. This plug allows water to flow to the dispenser and ice maker. Make sure the bypass plug is fully seated to prevent leaks. Then, turn your water supply back on. If you are installing a new filter, you can learn [how to install Frigidaire water filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-install-frigidaire-water-filter) after this step.

### Step-by-Step: Removing a Base Grille Filter

Some Frigidaire refrigerator models, particularly older side-by-side or certain top-freezer units, have their water filter located in the base grille. This is at the bottom front of the refrigerator, near the floor. Filters like the PureSource or PureSource2 often use this placement. Accessing this filter requires a slightly different approach than the top compartment models. I understand this position can be less convenient.

First, always turn off the water supply to your refrigerator. This step is critical to avoid water spills. Next, lay a clean towel or old newspapers on the floor beneath the base grille area. This protects your floor from any water drips. A shallow pan placed directly under the filter can also catch more significant spills.

Now, locate the filter housing in the base grille. It might be behind a small cover or directly exposed. Some models have a push-button release. You simply push the button, and the filter will partially eject. Other models require a twist. If it's a twist-type, grasp the exposed end of the filter. Turn it a quarter-turn counter-clockwise. You will feel it release from the housing.

As the filter disengages, pull it straight out. Do this slowly and carefully. A small amount of water will leak out. The towel or pan will catch this water. Try to keep the filter level as you pull it out to minimize spillage. This method is common for Frigidaire PureSource water filters.

After removing the old filter, inspect the filter receptacle inside the refrigerator. Wipe away any water or debris with a clean cloth. If you do not plan to install a new filter immediately, insert the bypass plug firmly into the filter housing. This plug ensures water flow to your dispenser and ice maker. If you are installing a new filter, ensure the area is clean. Turn the water supply back on once the old filter is out or the new filter/bypass plug is in.

### Step-by-Step: Removing a French Door/Inside Fridge Filter

Many Frigidaire French door refrigerators and some side-by-side models feature an internal water filter. This filter is often located within the fresh food compartment, but not always in the top-right corner like the twist-out type. It can sometimes be found in the left door or within a specific compartment lower in the fridge. These filters often use a push-in, pull-out mechanism, or a simple tab release. I find these filters generally simple to change.

As with any filter removal, start by turning off the water supply to your refrigerator. This prevents any unexpected leaks or sprays during the process. Place a towel or absorbent cloth directly under the filter housing. This will catch the small amount of water that might drip out when you remove the old filter.

Locate the filter. It might be behind a flip-down cover or in a dedicated slot. Some common filter types in this category include PureSource Ultra filters. Often, you will see a small tab or a push-release button. Press this tab or button firmly. This action will usually unlatch the filter from its locked position.

Once unlatched, grasp the filter firmly. Pull the filter straight out from its housing. You do not typically need to twist this type of filter. Just a straight pull is usually enough. Be prepared for a small amount of water to drip from the filter and the housing. The towel you placed earlier will absorb this.

After removing the old filter, check the filter housing for any debris. Wipe it clean with a damp cloth if necessary. This helps ensure a clean seal for the new filter. If you are not installing a new filter right away, insert the filter bypass plug into the housing. This plug keeps water flowing to your ice maker and dispenser. Make sure the plug clicks into place to prevent leaks. Once the old filter is out, or the bypass is in, turn the water supply back on. Following these steps helps keep your Frigidaire in good working order.

### Troubleshooting Common Filter Removal Issues

Sometimes, removing a Frigidaire water filter is not as straightforward as it seems. You might encounter a filter that is stuck, or you might see unexpected water leaks. Do not worry. These issues are common, and I can help you fix them. Knowing a few tricks makes the job much easier.

One common problem is a stuck filter. This often happens if the filter has been in place for too long. Mineral buildup can make it difficult to twist or pull. If your top-right twist-out filter feels stuck, try applying gentle, but firm, pressure. Use both hands if possible. Sometimes, a rubber grip pad or rubber gloves can give you extra leverage. Do not force it too much, as you might break the housing. For base grille push-button filters, ensure you are pressing the release button fully. If it still won't budge, try wiggling it slightly while pressing. In rare cases, a small amount of food-grade lubricant around the seal might help, but use it sparingly.

Another issue is water leakage after removal. Even with the water supply turned off, some water remains in the lines. This is normal. A few drips are expected. However, if water continues to flow or spray, your main water supply might not be completely shut off. Double-check the shut-off valve behind your refrigerator or under your sink. Ensure it is fully closed. Also, make sure your towels are well-placed to catch all drips.

If you removed the filter and are not installing a new one, you must use a bypass plug. Forgetting the bypass plug will cause water to leak out of the filter housing. Water will also not flow to your dispenser or ice maker. Make sure the bypass plug is the correct type for your Frigidaire model and that it is inserted securely. I cannot stress enough the importance of the bypass plug. It seals the system.

Lastly, sometimes the filter indicator light might not reset immediately after filter removal (or replacement). This is more of a post-removal issue. Most Frigidaire models require you to manually reset the filter light. You usually do this by pressing and holding the "Filter" or "Reset" button on the dispenser panel for a few seconds. Consult your owner's manual for specific instructions on resetting the light for your model.

### What to Do After Filter Removal (and Before New Installation)

Once you successfully take water filter out of Frigidaire, your work is not entirely done. There are a few important steps to take. These steps ensure cleanliness and proper functioning of your refrigerator's water system. I always follow these guidelines.

First, handle the old filter. The old filter contains trapped impurities and should be disposed of properly. Most water filters are not recyclable through standard curbside programs. Check with your local waste management services for specific disposal guidelines. Some communities have special recycling programs for water filters. You can also look for filter recycling programs offered by the filter manufacturer. For example, some companies, like Brita, have mail-back recycling programs.

Next, take a moment to clean the filter housing. Even if you turn off the water supply, some water and tiny particles might remain in the filter slot. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe inside the housing. You can use a mild soap solution if needed, but rinse thoroughly afterward. This cleaning step prepares the area for a new filter installation. It helps ensure a tight seal and prevents contamination. You can get more information on [how to clean water filter in fridge](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-water-filter-in-fridge) and the general process of [how to clean water filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-water-filter) for comprehensive care.

If you are not replacing the filter immediately, you must install the bypass plug. The bypass plug ensures water still flows to your ice maker and water dispenser. Without it, water would simply leak out of the filter housing. Make sure the bypass plug is fully inserted and locked into place. Listen for a click or feel it seat firmly. This prevents leaks and ensures normal refrigerator operation.

Finally, turn the water supply back on to your refrigerator. After turning it on, check for any leaks around the filter housing or where the water line connects. If you notice any drips, tighten connections or re-seat the bypass plug. Allow water to run through the dispenser for a few minutes. This flushes any air from the lines. I usually discard the first few glasses of water. This ensures you have fresh, clean water ready for use.

### Importance of Regular Filter Replacement

Knowing how to take water filter out of Frigidaire is only part of the job. Understanding why regular replacement is crucial helps you maintain your refrigerator and your health. Many people overlook this important maintenance task. I want to explain why it matters so much.

The primary purpose of your Frigidaire water filter is to remove impurities from your tap water. These impurities include chlorine, sediment, rust, lead, cysts, and other contaminants. Over time, the filter collects these substances. It becomes less effective at trapping new ones. A clogged filter cannot clean your water properly. It also restricts water flow.

Using an old, clogged filter can actually reintroduce contaminants into your water. The trapped particles can start to break down and release back into your drinking water. This defeats the whole purpose of having a filter. You might notice a change in your water's taste or smell. It could taste metallic or have a strange odor. This is a clear sign that your filter needs changing.

Regular filter replacement also helps your refrigerator function better. When the filter becomes clogged, the refrigerator's water dispenser and ice maker have to work harder. This puts strain on the water lines and internal components. Over time, this extra strain can lead to reduced water flow or even damage to the system. Keeping the filter fresh ensures smooth operation.

Most Frigidaire filters need to be replaced every six months or every 200 gallons of water dispensed. Your refrigerator usually has an indicator light that tells you when it's time to change the filter. This light changes color or blinks. Do not ignore this signal. Replacing the filter on time ensures you always have access to clean, fresh-tasting water and ice. It protects your health and extends the life of your appliance. Make sure to reset the filter light after each replacement.

### FAQ Section

#### How often should I take out and replace my Frigidaire water filter?
You should replace your Frigidaire water filter every six months. This is also recommended after dispensing about 200 gallons of water. Your refrigerator has an indicator light that will signal when it is time for a change. Replacing it regularly keeps your water tasting fresh and clean.

#### What tools do I need to remove a Frigidaire water filter?
You typically need minimal tools. A clean towel is essential to catch drips. For some stubborn filters, a rubber grip pad or rubber gloves can help. A small bucket or pan is useful for larger spills. No special tools are usually required for removal.

#### What is a bypass plug and do I need it?
A bypass plug is a small plastic part that replaces the water filter. It allows water to flow through the system when no filter is installed. You need a bypass plug if you remove the filter but do not install a new one immediately. It prevents leaks and ensures water flow to your dispenser and ice maker.

#### My filter is stuck, what should I do?
If your Frigidaire water filter is stuck, try applying firm, steady pressure. For twist-out filters, use both hands and turn counter-clockwise. For push-button filters, ensure the button is fully pressed while gently wiggling the filter. Avoid using excessive force to prevent damage to the housing.

#### How do I dispose of my old Frigidaire water filter?
Check with your local waste management services for specific disposal guidelines. Most water filters are not accepted in standard curbside recycling. Some filter manufacturers offer mail-back recycling programs. You can look into these options for proper disposal.

#### Will removing the water filter stop the ice maker from working?
No, removing the water filter will not stop the ice maker from working, provided you install a bypass plug. The bypass plug ensures water can still flow to both the ice maker and the water dispenser. Without the plug, water will leak from the filter housing, and the system will not work correctly.
