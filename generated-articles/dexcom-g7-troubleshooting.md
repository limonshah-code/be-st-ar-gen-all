## Addressing Dexcom G7 Sensor Errors and Failures

Experiencing a "Sensor Error" or "Sensor Failed" message can be frustrating. These messages mean the sensor itself is not working correctly. The Dexcom G7 system detects a problem with the sensor. It stops providing glucose readings. This requires immediate attention.

First, ensure proper sensor application. The sensor must be applied firmly to clean, dry skin. Choose an approved placement site, such as the back of your arm or abdomen. Improper application can lead to poor adhesion or faulty readings. Make sure the adhesive patch is smooth and completely stuck down. You can learn more about [improving continuous glucose monitor connectivity](https://beacleaner.com/dexcom-g6-signal-loss-troubleshooting) to ensure consistent data flow, as a well-adhered sensor also aids in stable communication.

Sometimes, a "Sensor Error" appears during the warm-up period. The Dexcom G7 sensor needs 30 minutes to warm up after insertion. During this time, the system calibrates itself. Do not expect readings immediately. If the error appears after warm-up, or the sensor fails to start, it is likely a faulty sensor.

If the sensor fails to work after warm-up, or you get a persistent "Sensor Error" message, you may need to replace it. Dexcom sensors are designed to work for 10 days. However, sometimes a sensor is faulty from the factory. Do not try to restart a failed sensor session. Removing and replacing the sensor is the correct action.

Before replacing, try restarting your display device or phone. This can sometimes clear a temporary software glitch. If the error persists after a device restart, contact Dexcom customer support. They can help you troubleshoot further or arrange a replacement sensor. Keep the failed sensor, as Dexcom may ask you to return it for analysis.

## Troubleshooting Inaccurate Dexcom G7 Readings

One of the most concerning issues is when your Dexcom G7 readings do not match your blood glucose meter. It is important to know that CGM readings are different from fingerstick readings. CGM measures interstitial fluid glucose. Fingersticks measure blood glucose. There is a natural lag between these two measurements.

Several factors can lead to inaccurate Dexcom G7 readings. Dehydration can affect sensor performance. Ensure you are well-hydrated throughout the day. Compression lows are also common. Lying on your sensor overnight can cause falsely low readings. This pressure squeezes the sensor and restricts fluid flow. Try to avoid sleeping directly on your sensor.

Medications can also interfere with accuracy. Acetaminophen, found in Tylenol, can cause falsely high readings on Dexcom G7. Always check medication labels for active ingredients. Discuss any concerns with your doctor. They can advise you on how specific medications might impact your CGM.

During the first 24 hours of a new sensor, readings may be less accurate. The sensor needs time to settle into your body. It is important to be patient during this period. Compare readings with a fingerstick if you are unsure. Do not calibrate your Dexcom G7 based on fingersticks unless instructed by Dexcom support. This can cause more problems.

If you suspect significant inaccuracy, perform a fingerstick test. If the difference is large and persistent, contact Dexcom support. Provide them with your sensor lot number and details about the discrepancy. They can help determine if the sensor is faulty. Effective [troubleshooting older Dexcom models](https://beacleaner.com/dexcom-g6-signal-loss-troubleshooting) also highlighted the need for stable app connections and avoiding such interferences for better accuracy.
