## The Essential Role of Guard Dogs at the Berlin Wall

The Berlin Wall stood for 28 years as a stark barrier between East and West Berlin. Within its intricate security system, **guard dogs at the Berlin Wall** played a critical and constant role. East German authorities used these animals to reinforce border security. They saw dogs as an effective, living deterrent against escape attempts.
