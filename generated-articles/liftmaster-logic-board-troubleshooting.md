    *   Locate any fuses on the logic board. They are often small glass tubes or plastic squares.
    *   With the multimeter set to continuity mode, touch probes to both ends of the fuse.
    *   A good fuse shows continuity (a beep or a low resistance reading). A blown fuse shows no continuity.
    *   Always replace fuses with the exact same type and rating.
*   **Testing Relays:**
    *   Relays are often black boxes on the board. They have multiple pins.
    *   Testing relays can be complex. It may require applying a small voltage to activate them.
    *   If you hear no click when the relay should activate, it may be faulty.
*   **Error Code Diagnostics:**
    *   Many LiftMaster models display error codes. These codes help identify problems.
    *   Consult your model's manual for specific error code meanings.
    *   For example, if you see error code 4-2, you can look up specific solutions. You may find more information in our article on [how to clear LiftMaster error code 4-2](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clear-liftmaster-error-code-4-2).
