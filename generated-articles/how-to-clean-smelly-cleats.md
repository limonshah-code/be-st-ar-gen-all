## How to Clean Smelly Cleats: Fresh Steps to Odor-Free Footwear

There is nothing quite like the smell of a locker room after a game. While that distinct aroma might bring back memories, the smell often comes from one source: smelly cleats. Odor from cleats can be very strong. It clings to your sports bag, your car, and even your clothes. You want to make your cleats smell fresh. This guide will show you how to clean smelly cleats. We will cover why they stink, what supplies you need, and the best cleaning methods. You will also learn how to prevent future odors.

**Takeaway:**

*   **Dry Cleats Immediately:** Remove insoles and air dry cleats right after use.
*   **Deep Clean Regularly:** Use soap and water to wash cleats thoroughly.
*   **Employ Natural Odor Fighters:** Baking soda and white vinegar are powerful deodorizers.
*   **Prevent Future Smell:** Store cleats in open air and rotate pairs.

To clean smelly cleats, remove laces and insoles. Knock off loose dirt. Scrub cleats inside and out with mild soap and water. Rinse thoroughly. Fill cleats with baking soda or newspaper. Air dry them completely away from direct heat. This process kills odor-causing bacteria and absorbs moisture.

### Why Do Cleats Get So Smelly? Understanding the Root Cause

Have you ever wondered why your cleats develop such a strong, unpleasant smell? It is not just dirt. The smell comes from bacteria. These tiny organisms thrive in warm, damp places. Your cleats are a perfect home for them.

#### Sweat and Bacteria: The Perfect Storm

Our feet produce a lot of sweat. When you play sports, your feet sweat even more. Sweat itself does not smell. It is a mix of water and salts. But bacteria on your skin eat the sweat. As bacteria break down sweat, they produce waste products. These waste products are what cause the bad smell. The inside of your cleats traps this bacteria.

#### Trapped Moisture: A Breeding Ground

Cleats are often made from materials that do not breathe well. Synthetic leather and thick padding hold onto moisture. After a game, your cleats are wet from sweat. If you put them in a bag or a closet right away, they stay wet. This creates a dark, moist environment. This environment is ideal for bacteria to multiply quickly. The more bacteria grow, the stronger the smell becomes. You can learn more about general shoe odor in our article on [how to clean smelly shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes).

The design of cleats also contributes to the problem. They have many small crevices. Dirt and sweat can get stuck in these areas. This makes it harder for air to circulate inside. Without good airflow, moisture remains trapped. This allows bacteria to grow without interruption. Think about how quickly a wet towel can start to smell if left balled up. Cleats are similar. Proper ventilation is key to fighting odor.

Many people store their cleats in a sports bag. They leave them there until the next practice. This is a common mistake. A closed bag does not allow cleats to dry. The moisture sits inside, feeding the bacteria. Over time, the smell becomes very difficult to remove. Understanding these factors helps you clean them better.

### Essential Supplies for Cleaning Smelly Cleats

Cleaning smelly cleats requires specific tools. You likely have many of these items at home already. Gathering your supplies before you start saves time. It makes the cleaning process smoother. Each item plays an important role.

#### Basic Cleaning Tools

You will need a few simple tools for scrubbing. A stiff brush is very helpful. An old toothbrush also works well for small areas. You will need a bucket or a large basin. This holds water and cleaning solutions. A few clean cloths or towels are also necessary for drying.

*   **Stiff-bristled brush:** Use this to remove loose dirt from the outside of the cleats. It works well on the soles and studs.
*   **Old toothbrush:** This is perfect for scrubbing tight spots. Use it around laces and in small crevices.
*   **Bucket or basin:** Fill this with water and your cleaning solution. Make sure it is large enough for the cleats.
*   **Clean cloths or towels:** You will use these for wiping and drying the cleats. Microfiber towels are great for absorbing moisture.

#### Odor-Fighting Agents

Certain products are excellent at neutralizing odors. These items go beyond just cleaning dirt. They attack the source of the smell: bacteria and their waste. You have options for both common household items and specific shoe products.

*   **Mild soap or laundry detergent:** A small amount of dish soap works well. You can also use a gentle liquid laundry detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals that might damage the cleat material.
*   **Baking soda:** This is a powerful natural deodorizer. It absorbs moisture and neutralizes odors. You will use a generous amount.
*   **White vinegar:** Vinegar kills bacteria and removes tough odors. It is acidic, so it breaks down the odor-causing compounds.
*   **Rubbing alcohol:** This helps to sanitize and kill bacteria. You can spray it inside the cleats.
*   **Newspaper or paper towels:** These absorb moisture quickly. They help speed up the drying process.
*   **Optional: Essential oils:** A few drops of tea tree or lavender oil can add a fresh scent. They also have some antibacterial properties. Add them to your baking soda mixture.

Having these supplies ready will make the task of cleaning smelly cleats much easier. You will be prepared for every step.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Deep Cleaning Your Smelly Cleats

Deep cleaning your cleats is the most effective way to eliminate stubborn odors. This process involves more than just a quick wipe. It tackles the dirt and bacteria inside and out. Following these steps carefully helps ensure your cleats come out smelling fresh.

#### Initial Prep: Remove Loose Debris

Start by preparing your cleats for cleaning. This first step removes the bulk of the dirt. It makes the deeper cleaning much easier. Do this outside if possible.

1.  **Remove laces and insoles:** Take out the laces from both cleats. Pull out the insoles too. These parts often hold onto a lot of sweat and dirt. They need separate cleaning.
2.  **Knock off loose dirt:** Hold each cleat over a trash can or outside. Hit the soles together gently. This knocks off any large clumps of mud or dirt. Use your stiff brush to scrape off remaining dirt from the studs and sides. Focus on the bottom.

#### Washing the Cleats: Inside and Out

Now, it is time for the real wash. You will need a bucket with warm water and soap. Be gentle with certain materials. Some cleats might not tolerate harsh scrubbing.

1.  **Prepare cleaning solution:** Fill a bucket with warm water. Add a small amount of mild dish soap or laundry detergent. Swirl it to create suds.
2.  **Scrub the outside:** Dip your stiff brush into the soapy water. Scrub the entire outside of the cleats. Pay attention to dirty areas. Clean the sides, the top, and the tongue. Rinse the brush as needed.
3.  **Clean the insoles and laces:** Place the insoles and laces in the soapy water. Scrub them with your old toothbrush. Wring them out and set them aside. They will dry separately.
4.  **Clean the inside:** Dip your old toothbrush into the soapy water. Carefully scrub the inside of the cleats. Focus on the footbed and heel area. This is where most odor-causing bacteria live. Make sure you reach all the small areas.

If you have baseball cleats, our article on [how to clean baseball cleats](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-baseball-cleats) also provides helpful steps.

#### Rinsing Thoroughly

Rinsing is critical. Leftover soap can attract more dirt. It can also leave residue. You want to remove all traces of soap.

1.  **Rinse cleats:** Hold each cleat under running water. Use cool or lukewarm water. Rinse until all soap suds are gone. Squeeze the cleats gently to help push water out.
2.  **Shake off excess water:** Give each cleat a few good shakes. This removes excess water. Then, use a clean towel to blot the outside. You want to get as much moisture off as possible before drying.

This deep cleaning method will refresh your cleats. It removes dirt and reduces much of the smell. The next steps focus on fighting the remaining odor and ensuring proper drying.

### The Power of Natural Odor Eliminators for Cleats

After a thorough wash, your cleats might still have a faint smell. This is where natural odor eliminators come in. These items are effective and safe. They neutralize remaining odors without harsh chemicals. Many of them you already have in your pantry.

#### Baking Soda: Your Odor Neutralizer

Baking soda is a miracle worker for odors. It absorbs moisture and neutralizes acidic and basic odor compounds. It does not just cover up smells. It eliminates them. This makes it perfect for stubborn cleat odors.

1.  **Ensure cleats are dry:** Baking soda works best in a dry environment. Make sure your cleats are mostly dry from washing.
2.  **Fill with baking soda:** Pour a generous amount of baking soda directly into each cleat. Make sure it reaches the toe area. Shake the cleat gently to distribute it.
3.  **Let it sit:** Leave the baking soda in the cleats overnight. For very strong odors, leave it for 24-48 hours. The longer it sits, the more odor it will absorb.
4.  **Remove baking soda:** After the waiting period, shake out all the baking soda. You can use a vacuum cleaner with a hose attachment to get stubborn bits. Your cleats should smell much fresher.

#### White Vinegar: Disinfecting and Deodorizing

White vinegar is another powerful ally against smells. Its acetic acid kills bacteria and mold. These are major sources of cleat odor. Vinegar also breaks down the smelly compounds.

1.  **Create a solution:** Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Do not use full-strength vinegar inside your cleats. It could damage some materials over time.
2.  **Spray the inside:** Lightly spray the inside of your cleats with the vinegar solution. Focus on the footbed and toe area.
3.  **Let it air out:** Allow the cleats to air dry completely after spraying. The vinegar smell will dissipate as it dries. This process disinfects the cleats. The vinegar smell will fade, leaving no odor behind.

#### Essential Oils and Citrus Peels

While not primary odor eliminators, these can add a pleasant scent. They work well after the main odor is gone. Some essential oils also have mild antibacterial properties.

*   **Essential oils:** Add a few drops of tea tree oil or lavender oil to your baking soda before putting it in the cleats. Tea tree oil is known for its antibacterial qualities. Lavender adds a fresh, calming scent.
*   **Citrus peels:** Place fresh orange, lemon, or grapefruit peels inside the cleats. Leave them overnight. The natural oils in the peels will absorb some odor and leave a fresh citrus scent. Remember to remove them before use.

Combining these natural methods helps get rid of even the most persistent odors. They are safe for your cleats and the environment. These are great methods for maintaining the freshness of your shoes in general, as mentioned in our article on [how to clean smelly shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes).

### Drying Cleats Properly: A Crucial Step to Prevent Smell

Proper drying is as important as cleaning. If cleats remain damp, odor-causing bacteria will grow again. This negates all your cleaning efforts. Heat can damage cleats, so air drying is always best. Avoid using a dryer or direct sunlight.

#### Air Drying Best Practices

Air drying allows moisture to evaporate naturally. This is the safest method for your cleats. It helps maintain their shape and material integrity. Patience is key with air drying.

1.  **Remove insoles and laces:** After washing, always take out the insoles and laces. This allows air to reach all parts of the cleat. These items will dry faster separately.
2.  **Stuff with newspaper or paper towels:** Crumple up clean newspaper or paper towels. Stuff them firmly into the cleats. The paper will absorb excess moisture from the inside. Change the paper every few hours if it becomes very damp.
3.  **Place in a well-ventilated area:** Find a spot with good airflow. A breezy porch, near an open window, or in front of a fan works well. Avoid direct sunlight. UV rays and high heat can crack or shrink the materials.
4.  **Elevate the cleats:** Prop the cleats up so air can circulate around them. You can use a shoe tree or place them on a rack. Do not lay them flat on the ground.
5.  **Allow ample time:** Cleats can take 24-48 hours to dry completely. Do not wear them until they are thoroughly dry inside and out. Even slightly damp cleats will quickly start to smell again.

#### Speeding Up Drying with Absorbents

Sometimes you need your cleats to dry faster. While natural air drying is ideal, you can use absorbents to speed up the process safely.

*   **Cedar shoe trees:** Cedar wood naturally absorbs moisture and has a pleasant scent. Insert cedar shoe trees into your cleats after cleaning. They help maintain shape and absorb dampness.
*   **Silica gel packets:** Save those small silica gel packets that come with new shoes or bags. Place several inside each cleat. They are very effective at absorbing moisture.
*   **Dryer sheets:** Place a fresh dryer sheet inside each cleat. While they do not absorb moisture much, they can help neutralize residual odors. They leave a fresh scent.
*   **Fan power:** Place your cleats in front of a fan. The continuous airflow will significantly reduce drying time. Make sure the fan is not blowing hot air.

Proper drying is a critical step in preventing cleat odor. It stops bacteria from growing back. Always ensure your cleats are completely dry before storing or wearing them again. This keeps them fresh and ready for your next game.

### Preventing Future Cleat Odor: Daily Habits and Smart Care

Cleaning smelly cleats is important. But preventing them from getting smelly in the first place is even better. Good habits and proper care after every use can make a big difference. This section outlines simple routines and storage tips. They will keep your cleats fresh for longer.

#### Post-Game Routines

What you do immediately after a game or practice is crucial. Many people just toss their cleats into a bag. This is the quickest way to create a smelly problem.

1.  **Air out immediately:** As soon as you finish playing, take your cleats out of your sports bag. Do not leave them cooped up. Let them air out in the open.
2.  **Remove insoles:** Always pull out the insoles. This allows both the insoles and the inside of the cleat to dry completely. Insoles absorb a lot of sweat. You can even store them outside the cleats to air dry separately.
3.  **Wipe down if wet:** If your cleats are wet from rain or damp conditions, wipe them down with a towel. Remove excess moisture from the outside. This prevents mold and mildew from forming on the exterior.
4.  **Stuff with newspaper:** If your cleats are particularly damp, stuff them with newspaper. As mentioned before, newspaper absorbs moisture. Change it regularly until the cleats are dry.

#### Storage Solutions

How you store your cleats impacts their freshness. A proper storage method allows them to dry and breathe. This inhibits bacterial growth.

1.  **Store in a dry, open area:** Never store cleats in a sealed bag or a dark, damp closet. Store them in a well-ventilated space. A mesh shoe bag or a wire rack is ideal. This allows air to circulate around them.
2.  **Rotate cleats:** If you play sports frequently, consider having two pairs of cleats. Rotate between them. This gives each pair at least 24-48 hours to fully dry out between uses. This significantly reduces odor build-up.
3.  **Use odor absorbers:** Place activated charcoal bags or cedar blocks inside your cleats when storing them. These items naturally absorb moisture and odors. They work continuously to keep the cleats fresh. You can also make DIY odor absorbers with old socks filled with baking soda and tie them up. For general shoe care, these tips are also very useful as detailed in our guide on [how to clean shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes).

#### Choosing the Right Socks and Footwear

Your choice of socks can also influence cleat odor. Some materials wick away moisture better than others. This helps keep your feet and cleats drier.

1.  **Moisture-wicking socks:** Wear socks made from synthetic moisture-wicking materials. These fabrics pull sweat away from your feet. Cotton socks absorb sweat and hold it against your skin. This creates a damp environment for bacteria.
2.  **Change socks frequently:** If you play multiple games or practices in one day, change your socks. Fresh, dry socks will help keep your feet from sweating excessively. This, in turn, keeps your cleats drier.
3.  **Foot powder or antiperspirant:** Use a foot powder or antiperspirant on your feet before putting on cleats. These products reduce sweat and inhibit bacterial growth. Apply them consistently.

By adopting these preventative measures, you can drastically reduce the chances of your cleats developing bad smells. It is about being proactive rather than reactive.

### When to Say Goodbye: Knowing When Cleats are Beyond Saving

Despite your best efforts, sometimes cleats reach the end of their useful life. There comes a point when cleaning and deodorizing simply cannot rescue them. Knowing when to replace your cleats is important for hygiene and performance. It saves you time and effort on a lost cause.

#### Signs of Irreparable Odor

Some smells are just too deeply set. They indicate a significant bacterial problem. This often means the material itself is saturated with odor-causing bacteria.

1.  **Persistent smell after cleaning:** You have washed, soaked, baked with soda, and aired them out. Still, a strong, foul odor remains. This is a clear sign. The smell might return quickly after minimal use.
2.  **Mold or mildew growth:** If you see visible mold or mildew inside your cleats, especially in the seams or under the insoles, it is a serious issue. Mold can be difficult to remove entirely. It can also pose health risks.
3.  **Odor spreads to other items:** If the smell from your cleats easily transfers to your socks, other clothes, or your bag, they are likely beyond saving. The material is too saturated with bacteria.

Even with strong cleaning efforts, if the odor returns within hours of wearing the cleats, the battle is likely lost. The internal materials have absorbed too much bacteria and sweat residue.

#### Material Degradation

Beyond just the smell, physical wear and tear also indicate it is time for new cleats. Damaged materials can harbor more bacteria. They also offer less support and protection.

1.  **Cracked or crumbling material:** Over time, the inner lining, especially around the heel and toe, can break down. This creates more pockets for sweat and bacteria to hide. Once the material starts to crumble, it is hard to clean effectively.
2.  **Worn-out padding:** The padding inside cleats, particularly in the footbed, compresses and degrades. This reduces comfort and absorbs more moisture. If the padding is flat or torn, it cannot do its job well.
3.  **Damaged structure:** Cleats need to support your feet. If the sole separates from the upper, or if the studs are worn down or broken, it affects your performance and safety. These physical damages also create new areas for dirt and moisture to accumulate.

Investing in a new pair of cleats is often the best solution when these signs appear. It ensures you have proper support. It also gives you a fresh start with your odor prevention strategy. Remember, your cleats are tools for your sport. Keeping them in good condition, or replacing them when needed, is part of being a good athlete.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Here are answers to common questions about cleaning smelly cleats.

**Can I put my cleats in the washing machine?**
Most manufacturers advise against machine washing cleats. The harsh agitation and hot water can damage the materials. It can also cause glues to weaken and cleats to shrink or warp. Hand washing is safer and more effective for deep cleaning. It helps maintain the cleat's shape and integrity.

**How often should I clean my cleats?**
Clean your cleats regularly. A quick wipe and air dry after every use is ideal. Perform a deep clean every few weeks or once a month, depending on how often you play and how much they smell. Frequent cleaning prevents odor buildup. This makes the deep cleaning process easier.

**What if my cleats still smell after cleaning?**
If cleats still smell, repeat the baking soda treatment. Let the baking soda sit for a longer period, perhaps 48 hours. You can also try a stronger white vinegar spray. Ensure the cleats are completely dry before and after treatments. Persistent smell might mean the cleats are too old or damaged to fully deodorize.

**Are odor balls effective?**
Odor balls can be effective for maintenance. They absorb some moisture and neutralize minor odors between cleanings. They are not a substitute for deep cleaning. Use them regularly after games to keep cleats fresh. Place them inside when storing your cleats.

**Do specific cleat materials smell more?**
Synthetic materials like plastic or artificial leather often trap more odor than natural materials like genuine leather. Synthetic materials are less breathable. They hold onto sweat and bacteria more readily. Leather cleats tend to breathe better, but they also require specific care to prevent drying and cracking.

**Can foot powder help?**
Yes, foot powder is very helpful. Apply foot powder to your feet before putting on your socks and cleats. It absorbs sweat. It helps keep your feet and cleats drier. Many foot powders also contain ingredients that inhibit bacterial and fungal growth. This reduces odor.
