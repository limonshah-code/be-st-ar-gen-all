Having clear goals guides your design choices. If you want a dining area and a lounge, you must plan for both. This step is crucial for creating a truly multipurpose space. Think about how these activities can overlap or transition throughout the day.

Your goals determine the type of furniture and accessories you choose. If quiet relaxation is a priority, consider a comfortable lounge chair and soft lighting.
