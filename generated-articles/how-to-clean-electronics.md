For stubborn smudges, use a specific screen cleaning solution. Spray the solution onto your microfiber cloth. Never spray it directly onto the screen. Wipe the screen gently. Use circular motions or clean from top to bottom. Ensure no liquid drips into seams. This method works for laptops, monitors, smartphones, and TVs. Your screen will look crisp and clean. A clean screen improves your viewing experience greatly.

## Cleaning Keyboards and Mice

Keyboards and mice gather a lot of grime. Food crumbs fall between keys. Skin oils and dirt build up on surfaces. This makes them feel sticky. It also harbors many germs. Regular cleaning makes them comfortable to use. It also keeps them hygienic.

Start by turning off your computer. Unplug the keyboard and mouse. For keyboards, turn it upside down. Shake it gently over a trash can. This removes loose crumbs. Use compressed air to blow out debris between keys. Hold the can upright. Use short bursts. Do not spray too close. A small, soft brush can also sweep out dirt. Gently brush between the keys.

For cleaning the keycaps, dampen a microfiber cloth with isopropyl alcohol. Wipe each key. Use a cotton swab for tight corners. For the mouse, wipe its surface with a damp cloth. Clean the optical sensor at the bottom. Make sure no liquid enters the mouse. Keeping these input devices clean improves their function. It also makes your workspace healthier.

## Maintaining Ports and Vents on Electronics
