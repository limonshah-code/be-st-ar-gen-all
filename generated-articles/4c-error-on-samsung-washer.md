### The 4c error on a Samsung washer indicates an issue with the water supply. Your machine is not receiving enough water to properly fill and proceed with its wash cycle. This error often points to problems with water pressure, clogged inlet filters, or a faulty water inlet valve.

## Understanding the Samsung Washer 4C Error Code

The Samsung washer 4C error code appears when the machine detects insufficient water entering its drum. This error means the washer cannot perform its main function. It protects your appliance from operating without water. When the error shows, the machine typically pauses or stops the cycle. It waits for the water issue to resolve.

This error is a helpful diagnostic tool. It quickly tells you where to focus your troubleshooting efforts. You know the problem relates to water intake. This helps you narrow down potential causes immediately. Many basic fixes for this error are straightforward.

The 4C error is also sometimes displayed as an "LC" error on some models. Both codes point to the same problem: a lack of water supply. It is important to know this. If you see LC, treat it like a 4C issue. Your Samsung washer wants water.

This issue can stem from various sources. These include external plumbing problems or internal washer component faults. I have found most cases are simple to resolve. You just need to follow a logical diagnostic process.

## Checking Your Water Supply Connections

The very first step when you see a 4c error on your Samsung washer is to check the basics. Your washing machine needs a strong and steady water flow. Without it, the error code will persist. This check is easy and quick to do.

First, ensure both the hot and cold water faucets behind your washing machine are fully open. Sometimes, these valves get accidentally closed or only partially open. A simple turn can often fix the problem immediately. You might be surprised how often this is the case. This is a common oversight.

Next, inspect the water inlet hoses connected to these faucets and the back of your washer. Look for any kinks, bends, or damage. A kinked hose restricts water flow significantly. Straighten any kinks you find. If a hose appears damaged, replace it. A leaky hose also reduces water pressure, which can trigger the 4c error.

Also, check your household water pressure. You can test this by running a nearby faucet. The water flow should be strong and consistent. If the water pressure in your house is low, this affects all appliances. Low water pressure from your home's main supply will prevent the washer from filling properly. In such cases, contact your water utility provider.

Sometimes, a general household water supply interruption can be the cause. This might happen due to maintenance work in your area. Check with neighbors or your utility company. Confirm there are no current water outages.

## Inspecting the Water Inlet Filters

Even with good water pressure and clear hoses, the 4c error on your Samsung washer can still appear. The next place to look is at the water inlet filters. These small screens are crucial. They protect your washing machine from debris in your household water supply.

Over time, sediment, rust particles, or mineral deposits can accumulate on these filters. This accumulation acts like a blockage. It restricts water flow into the washer. A clogged filter means the machine cannot get enough water, even if the main supply is strong. Cleaning these filters is a common and effective solution.

To access these filters, first turn off the hot and cold water supply faucets connected to your washer. Then, carefully disconnect the water inlet hoses from the back of the washing machine. You will see small, mesh-like cone filters inside the inlet ports where the hoses connect. These are your inlet filters.

Use a pair of needle-nose pliers or tweezers to gently pull out these filters. Be careful not to damage them. Once removed, rinse them under running water to clear any debris. You can use a small brush, like an old toothbrush, to scrub away stubborn buildup. If a filter is damaged, you will need to replace it.

After cleaning, carefully reinsert the filters back into the inlet ports. Ensure they are seated correctly. Then, reattach the water inlet hoses, making sure they are tight but not overtightened. Finally, turn the water supply back on and check for leaks. Running a test cycle should confirm if the 4c error is gone. Regularly cleaning these filters can prevent future water supply issues and maintain your washer's efficiency.

## Troubleshooting the Water Inlet Valve

If your water supply and filters are clear, the next potential culprit for a 4c error on your Samsung washer is the water inlet valve. This valve is an electrical component. It controls the flow of water into the washing machine drum. It opens when the machine needs water and closes when the drum is full.

A faulty water inlet valve can restrict or completely stop water flow. This happens even if water pressure is good. The valve might be stuck partially open, fully closed, or it might not respond to the machine's signals. You may hear a buzzing noise but no water filling. Sometimes, only one side (hot or cold) of the valve fails, leading to partial fills or incorrect wash temperatures.

Testing the water inlet valve can be tricky. It involves working with electrical components. First, ensure your washer is unplugged from the power outlet. Safety is very important here. You can access the valve by removing the back panel of your washing machine. You will see the valve where the water hoses connect internally.

Look for any visible signs of damage or corrosion on the valve itself. Test the solenoids on the valve using a multimeter set to measure resistance (ohms). A good solenoid will show a specific resistance reading, typically between 50 to 1,000 ohms, depending on the model. If a solenoid shows no continuity or an infinite resistance, it is faulty. You will need to replace the entire water inlet valve assembly.

This repair often requires a replacement part specific to your Samsung washer model. It also requires some comfort with appliance repair. If you are unsure, it might be best to call a qualified technician. Attempting repairs without proper knowledge can cause more damage. However, understanding this component helps you diagnose the problem. For issues with specific Samsung models, you might find more detailed help in guides like [Samsung VRT Washer Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/samsung-vrt-washer-troubleshooting) or [Samsung VRT Plus Washer Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/samsung-vrt-plus-washer-troubleshooting).

## Examining the Detergent Dispenser and Drain Hose

While less common, issues with the detergent dispenser or drain hose can indirectly cause a 4c error on your Samsung washer. These components affect how water flows and drains from the machine. Any blockage or incorrect setup can confuse the washer's sensors.

First, let's look at the detergent dispenser. This tray sometimes accumulates detergent residue, fabric softener, or mold. These buildups can block the small holes where water enters the dispenser to mix with detergent. If these channels are blocked, water may not properly reach the drum. This makes the machine think it is not filling. Clean the dispenser thoroughly. Remove the dispenser drawer if possible and wash it under hot water. Use a brush to clear any clogs in the housing where the drawer sits.

Next, consider the drain hose. While the 4c error is about *filling*, a siphoning effect can trick the washer. If the drain hose is inserted too far down the standpipe or is too low to the floor, water can continuously drain out as it fills. This creates a siphoning action. The washer tries to fill, but water drains away as quickly as it enters. The water level sensor never detects enough water, triggering the 4c error.

To correct a siphoning issue, ensure your drain hose is correctly installed. The end of the drain hose should be at least 34 inches (86 cm) above the floor. It should also have an air gap between the hose and the standpipe. This prevents the siphoning effect. Many hoses come with a U-shaped bracket to secure them at the correct height. Make sure this bracket is used and positioned correctly.

Additionally, check for any blockages in the drain hose itself. While rare, a severe clog could potentially create back pressure. This might interfere with water level sensing. However, siphoning is a more common issue related to the drain hose and the 4c error. Ensuring correct installation and a clean dispenser helps eliminate these indirect causes. If you have a [Samsung Active WaterJet Washer troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/samsung-active-waterjet-washer-troubleshooting) may involve checking dispenser functionality too.

## Addressing Pressure Sensor and Wiring Issues

After checking the obvious water supply components, the 4c error on your Samsung washer might point to a more internal issue: the pressure sensor or its related wiring. The pressure sensor, also known as a water level sensor, is critical. It tells the main control board how much water is inside the drum. If this sensor malfunctions, it can provide inaccurate readings.

For example, the sensor might tell the washer the drum is empty even when it is filling. Or, it might report a low water level even after a full fill. This miscommunication causes the washing machine to continue trying to fill. Eventually, it times out and displays the 4c error. A faulty sensor prevents the cycle from progressing.

The pressure sensor is typically connected to an air trap hose. This hose runs from the bottom of the tub to the sensor. If this air trap hose is clogged with lint or soap residue, it cannot transmit accurate pressure readings. Even if the sensor itself is fine, a blocked hose will make it appear faulty. Disconnect the hose from the sensor and blow through it to clear any blockages.

Wiring issues can also disrupt the sensor's communication with the control board. Check the wire harness connected to the pressure sensor. Look for loose connections, frayed wires, or signs of corrosion. A damaged wire can prevent the signal from reaching the main board. This causes the board to assume no water is entering. You can use a multimeter to check for continuity in the wiring. Repair or replace any damaged wires.

Accessing the pressure sensor usually requires removing the top or back panel of your Samsung washing machine. Ensure the washer is unplugged before you begin. If the sensor itself is determined to be faulty after these checks, it will need replacement. This part is specific to your washer model. Replacing it might require professional assistance if you are not comfortable with appliance electronics.

## Resetting Your Samsung Washer and Control Panel

Sometimes, the 4c error on your Samsung washer is not due to a physical problem. It can be a temporary glitch in the machine's electronics. A simple reset can often clear these transient errors. This method is always worth trying before attempting more involved repairs. It is quick, safe, and can resolve many minor issues.

The most basic way to reset your Samsung washing machine is to perform a power cycle. Unplug the washer from the wall outlet. Wait for at least 5 to 10 minutes. This allows any residual electrical charge in the control board to dissipate. While waiting, you can also hold down the "Start/Pause" button for a few seconds. This can help clear internal memory. After the waiting period, plug the washer back in.

Another type of reset involves accessing a diagnostic mode or performing a hard reset through the control panel. The exact steps vary by Samsung model. Often, it involves pressing a specific combination of buttons. For some models, holding down the "Temp" and "Delay End" buttons simultaneously for a few seconds can initiate a reset. Check your washer's user manual for specific instructions for your model. Your manual is the best source for accurate reset procedures.

A successful reset will clear the error code from the display. It also refreshes the washer's internal systems. After the reset, try running a short test cycle. Observe if the washer fills properly and if the 4c error reappears. If the error returns immediately, it suggests a persistent physical or component issue. This means you need to continue with more detailed troubleshooting steps.

Performing a reset is a crucial diagnostic step. It helps differentiate between a temporary electronic glitch and a genuine hardware failure. If a reset solves the problem, you save time and money on unnecessary repairs. Many troubleshooting guides, including those for [Samsung Top Loader Washing Machine Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/samsung-top-loader-washing-machine-troubleshooting), recommend a reset early on.
