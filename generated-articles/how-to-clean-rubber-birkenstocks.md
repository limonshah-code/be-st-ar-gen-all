## How To Clean Rubber Birkenstocks: A Simple Guide

Do your favorite rubber Birkenstocks look a bit tired? Many people love their Birkenstock EVA sandals. These sandals offer comfort and durability. They are also very easy to clean. This guide will show you how to clean rubber Birkenstocks, removing dirt and keeping them fresh. We will cover simple steps for everyday dirt and deeper cleaning methods for tough stains. Get ready to make your rubber Birkenstocks look new again.

### Takeaway

Keeping your rubber Birkenstocks clean is simple.
*   Use mild soap and water for most dirt.
*   A soft brush helps with stubborn spots.
*   Always air dry your sandals away from direct heat.
*   Regular cleaning prevents dirt buildup and odors.

Cleaning rubber Birkenstocks involves mild soap, water, and a soft brush. Scrub gently to remove dirt and stains. Rinse them well and let them air dry completely. This process keeps them looking fresh and extends their lifespan.

### Understanding Your Rubber Birkenstocks (EVA Material)

Your rubber Birkenstocks are not made from traditional rubber. They consist of a material called EVA. EVA stands for Ethylene-vinyl acetate. This material is a type of foam. It makes your Birkenstocks lightweight, flexible, and waterproof. This is why cleaning rubber Birkenstocks is much simpler than cleaning leather or cork versions.

EVA does not absorb water like other materials. This means dirt and grime sit on the surface. They do not soak deeply into the material. This makes stains easier to wipe away. Understanding this helps you choose the right cleaning method. You do not need harsh chemicals for this material.

#### What Makes EVA Special?

EVA is very durable. It resists odors naturally more than some other shoe materials. It also dries very quickly. These properties make EVA Birkenstocks perfect for beach days or casual wear. Their structure also means they do not crack or stiffen easily. This material choice is a key reason why these sandals are so popular.

Unlike classic Birkenstocks with cork footbeds, EVA models handle water well. You can rinse them under the tap. This makes everyday cleaning very easy. Just remember to use gentle methods. You should still avoid harsh scrubbing or strong cleaners. They can damage the surface over time. If you have other plastic shoes, you might find similar cleaning methods useful.

### Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you start cleaning, gather a few basic items. You likely have most of these at home already. Using the right tools helps clean effectively without damaging your sandals. Always choose mild products for your rubber Birkenstocks. Strong chemicals can strip the material or leave a sticky residue.

You do not need special shoe cleaners for EVA. Simple household items work best. These supplies are gentle on the material. They are also safe for your skin. Get everything ready before you start cleaning. This makes the process smooth and quick.

#### Essential Tools for Cleaning

*   **A small bowl or bucket:** This holds water for rinsing or soaking.
*   **Mild soap:** Dish soap or hand soap works well. Choose a gentle, non-abrasive type. Baby shampoo is another good option.
*   **Soft brush:** An old toothbrush, a soft-bristled scrub brush, or a nail brush is ideal. A sponge or soft cloth can also work. Avoid stiff wire brushes.
*   **Clean cloths:** Microfiber cloths are excellent for wiping. You can also use any soft, absorbent cloth.
*   **Running water:** A sink or outdoor hose provides easy rinsing.
*   **Optional: Baking soda:** This helps with stubborn odors.

Make sure your cleaning area is clear. You might want to clean over a sink or outdoors. This prevents making a mess. Now you have everything ready to make your rubber Birkenstocks sparkle.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Basic Cleaning

Basic cleaning is perfect for everyday dirt and light grime. This method removes dust, superficial marks, and light stains. It keeps your sandals looking good between deep cleans. Regular basic cleaning also prevents dirt from building up. This makes future deep cleaning easier. I do this quick clean often. It helps my sandals stay fresh.

This method is fast and simple. You can do it weekly or after a messy day out. It extends the life of your Birkenstocks. It also keeps them hygienic.

#### Quick Wipe-Down Method

1.  **Rinse them off:** Hold your rubber Birkenstocks under cool running water. Rinse off any loose dirt or sand. This step prevents scratching the material during scrubbing. Ensure water reaches all parts of the sandal.
2.  **Apply mild soap:** Put a few drops of mild soap onto a wet soft cloth or brush. Gently rub the cloth or brush together to create some suds. You do not need a lot of soap. A small amount works well.
3.  **Gently scrub:** Use the soapy cloth or brush to scrub the entire surface of your Birkenstocks. Pay attention to the footbed, straps, and soles. Work in small circular motions. Be gentle to avoid damaging the material. This removes surface dirt and grime.
4.  **Rinse thoroughly:** Rinse your Birkenstocks completely under cool running water again. Make sure all soap residue washes away. Soap left on the material can attract more dirt later. It can also make the surface feel sticky.
5.  **Pat dry:** Use a clean, dry cloth to pat the sandals dry. Remove as much water as possible. This speeds up the drying process. Do not rub hard. Just gently press the cloth against the material.

After patting dry, let them air dry completely. This basic cleaning takes only a few minutes. It makes a big difference in how your rubber Birkenstocks look and feel.

### Deep Cleaning Your Rubber Birkenstocks

Sometimes, basic cleaning is not enough. Your rubber Birkenstocks might have stubborn stains or deeply embedded dirt. This happens after long use or particularly dirty adventures. A deep clean can revive them. This method involves a bit more effort. However, it provides excellent results. I find this necessary every few months. It brings back their original brightness.

Deep cleaning is also great for sandals that have been stored for a while. It prepares them for fresh use. This process helps remove any buildup. It also gets rid of persistent odors.

#### Tackling Stubborn Stains

1.  **Prepare a soaking solution:** Fill a small basin or bucket with warm water. Add a generous squirt of mild dish soap. Stir the water to create a bubbly solution. Ensure the soap is fully dissolved in the water.
2.  **Soak the sandals:** Place your rubber Birkenstocks into the soapy water. Make sure they are fully submerged. Let them soak for about 15-30 minutes. Soaking helps loosen stubborn dirt and grime. It makes scrubbing much easier.
3.  **Scrub thoroughly:** After soaking, take one sandal out of the water. Use your soft brush to scrub all surfaces. Pay close attention to the textured footbed. Dirt can get trapped there. Scrub the straps and the outer soles as well. For hard-to-reach areas, use an old toothbrush.
4.  **Focus on specific stains:** For really tough spots, apply a small amount of undiluted mild soap directly to the stain. Let it sit for a minute. Then, scrub vigorously with your brush. This concentrated cleaning helps break down the stain. If you are cleaning white rubber shoes, this method is especially effective.

5.  **Rinse completely:** Rinse the Birkenstocks under cool running water until all soap is gone. Check for any leftover suds. It is important to rinse them completely. Any soap residue can become sticky or attract dirt.
6.  **Check for cleanliness:** Inspect your sandals. If any stains remain, repeat the scrubbing steps. Sometimes, a second round is needed for very stubborn marks. Once clean, pat them dry with a clean cloth.

### Removing Odors from Rubber Birkenstocks

Rubber Birkenstocks, especially the EVA models, are less prone to odor than some other materials. However, prolonged wear, especially without socks, can lead to smells. This happens from sweat and bacteria buildup. Odors can be unpleasant. Luckily, removing them is quite simple. You do not need harsh chemicals for this. I have used these methods myself, and they work well.

Dealing with shoe odors is a common issue. It is important to address the root cause, which is usually moisture and bacteria. Once you clean them, steps to prevent future odors are helpful. This keeps your sandals fresh.

#### Freshness After Cleaning

1.  **Ensure they are dry:** Before attempting odor removal, ensure your Birkenstocks are completely dry. Moisture traps odors. If they are damp, let them air dry fully first.
2.  **Baking soda method:** This is a very effective natural deodorizer.
    *   Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda inside the footbed of each sandal.
    *   Make sure to cover the entire footbed, especially the contoured parts.
    *   Let the baking soda sit overnight, or even for 24 hours. Baking soda absorbs odors very well.
    *   After the waiting period, shake out the baking soda. Use a vacuum cleaner attachment to remove any remaining powder.
3.  **Sunlight and fresh air:** Direct sunlight can also help kill bacteria causing odors.
    *   After cleaning and baking soda treatment, place your Birkenstocks in a sunny, well-ventilated area for a few hours.
    *   Avoid direct, intense sunlight for very long periods, as it can potentially warp the EVA material over many hours or days. A few hours is usually fine.
    *   Fresh air helps air out any lingering smells.
4.  **Lysol or disinfectant spray (use with caution):** If odors persist, a shoe disinfectant spray can help.
    *   Lightly spray the inside of the sandals.
    *   Do not drench them.
    *   Allow them to air dry completely.
    *   Test in a small, hidden area first to ensure no discoloration. This is a last resort.
5.  **Regular airing out:** To prevent future odors, air out your rubber Birkenstocks after each wear. Do not store them in a dark, confined space immediately. Let them breathe. This simple habit makes a big difference.

### Drying Your Rubber Birkenstocks Properly

Proper drying is a critical step after cleaning your rubber Birkenstocks. If you do not dry them correctly, moisture can remain. This can lead to new odors or even damage the material over time. It is important to be patient during this stage. Hurrying the drying process can cause problems. I always ensure my sandals are completely dry before wearing or storing them. This prevents many common issues.

EVA material is waterproof, but it still needs to dry completely. This includes any remaining moisture on the surface or in small crevices. Incorrect drying can warp the material. It can also leave water spots.

1.  **Pat dry initially:** After rinsing, use a clean, dry towel to pat down your Birkenstocks. This removes excess water. Focus on both the inside and outside surfaces. This step reduces the overall drying time. It also prevents watermarks.
2.  **Air dry completely:** Find a well-ventilated area indoors or outdoors. Place your Birkenstocks where air can circulate around them. A shady spot outdoors is ideal. If drying indoors, ensure good air movement.
3.  **Avoid direct heat:** Never place your rubber Birkenstocks in direct sunlight for extended periods. Do not put them near heaters, radiators, or use a hairdryer. EVA material can warp or shrink under high heat. This damage is often permanent. The heat can distort the shape of the footbed. This would ruin the comfort and fit.
4.  **Allow sufficient time:** Depending on humidity and air circulation, drying can take a few hours. For a deep clean, it might even take overnight. Ensure they are bone dry before wearing them again. Check the footbed carefully. It can hold moisture longer.
5.  **Check for dampness:** Before putting them away, feel all parts of the sandal. Make sure there is no dampness. A small amount of moisture can encourage bacterial growth. This leads to odors later. If they feel even slightly damp, let them dry longer.

Proper drying ensures your rubber Birkenstocks maintain their shape. It also keeps them fresh and ready for your next adventure. Taking this extra step protects your investment.

### Maintaining Your Rubber Birkenstocks for Long Life

Regular maintenance keeps your rubber Birkenstocks in excellent condition. It extends their lifespan significantly. You want your comfortable sandals to last many seasons. This involves more than just cleaning them when they look dirty. It includes habits that protect the material. I find that a little effort regularly saves a lot of trouble later. This approach also keeps them looking good.

Preventive care is key to long-lasting footwear. It protects the integrity of the EVA material. It also ensures hygiene. Following these tips will help you enjoy your Birkenstocks for years.

#### Tips for Long-Term Care

1.  **Clean regularly:** Do not wait until your Birkenstocks are heavily soiled. A quick wipe-down after each wear, especially if you have been in dusty or muddy areas, helps. This prevents dirt from embedding into the material. It also makes deep cleaning less frequent.
2.  **Store properly:** When you are not wearing your Birkenstocks, store them in a cool, dry place. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or hot places like a car. High temperatures can cause the EVA to warp or shrink permanently. This can ruin the fit.
3.  **Rotate your footwear:** If you wear your rubber Birkenstocks daily, consider having a second pair. Rotating shoes gives each pair time to air out and recover. This reduces wear and tear on a single pair. It also helps with odor prevention.
4.  **Avoid harsh chemicals:** Stick to mild soaps for cleaning. Do not use strong detergents, bleach, or abrasive cleaners. These can degrade the EVA material over time. They can also cause discoloration. Harsh chemicals might also leave a residue.
5.  **Address issues quickly:** If you notice a small tear or scuff, address it promptly. Small problems can become bigger ones if ignored. While EVA is durable, it is not indestructible. Minor repairs can prevent further damage.
6.  **Protect from sharp objects:** EVA is a soft material. It can be cut or punctured by sharp objects. Be mindful of where you walk. Avoid walking over sharp rocks or debris that could damage the sole or footbed.
7.  **Consider strap care:** The straps on rubber Birkenstocks are also made of EVA. They clean easily with the rest of the sandal. If they get particularly dirty, focus extra scrubbing on them. Keeping the straps clean is part of overall maintenance.

By following these maintenance tips, your rubber Birkenstocks will remain comfortable, clean, and durable for many seasons. They are a great investment when cared for properly.
