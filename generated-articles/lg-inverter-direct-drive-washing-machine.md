Foul odors often come from mold or mildew buildup. This is common in washing machines, especially front-loaders. Regularly run the TubClean cycle. Also, wipe the rubber gasket around the door. Moisture can get trapped there.

Leaving the washer door ajar after each wash helps air dry the drum. This prevents mold growth. Use high-efficiency (HE) detergent only. Regular detergents create too many suds. These suds leave residue that promotes odor. If mold is a persistent issue, refer to [how to clean mold from washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-from-washing-machine).

## LG Inverter Direct Drive: Front Load vs. Top Load Models

When you decide on an **LG Inverter Direct Drive washing machine**, you face a choice. Should you get a front-load or a top-load model? Both types offer the benefits of LG's advanced technology. However, they each have distinct advantages and disadvantages. I often get asked which one is better. The answer truly depends on your specific needs and preferences.

Understanding the differences helps you make the right choice for your home. We will look at the strengths of both front-load and top-load designs. This will help you decide which one fits your laundry routine best.

### Front Load Advantages

LG front-load Inverter Direct Drive washers are very popular. They are known for their exceptional cleaning performance. Front loaders use less water than top loaders. They clean clothes by tumbling them. This gentle action helps preserve fabrics. It also makes them very energy-efficient.

Front-load models are typically stackable. This saves space in smaller laundry areas. They often have higher spin speeds. This removes more water from clothes. Clothes come out drier, reducing drying time. They also generally offer more cycle options. If you experience issues with your front-load model, you can consult [lg front load washing machine troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/lg-front-load-washing-machine-troubleshooting).

### Top Load Advantages
