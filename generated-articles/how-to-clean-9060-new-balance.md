I know the feeling of wanting my sneakers to look new, even after many wears. Knowing **how to clean 9060 New Balance** shoes properly helps keep them looking sharp. This guide helps you restore your 9060s, keeping them in top condition for longer. We will cover everything from simple surface cleaning to handling tough stains.

### Takeaway:

*   Gather all cleaning supplies before starting.

To clean 9060 New Balance shoes, gather a soft brush, mild soap, microfiber cloths, and a suede eraser. Remove laces and insoles. Dry brush the entire shoe. Gently clean mesh with a damp cloth and suede with a dedicated brush. Scrub midsoles and outsoles. Air dry completely.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Tools for New Balance 9060

Before you start cleaning your New Balance 9060 shoes, it is important to have all your supplies ready. This step saves time and makes the cleaning process smooth. Using the right tools protects the shoe materials. I always make sure everything is at hand before I begin.

You will need a few basic items. These items are often found around the house or are easy to buy. A soft-bristle brush is essential for gentle cleaning. A medium-bristle brush works well for tougher areas like soles. I use a microfiber cloth for wiping and drying.

For cleaning solutions, a mild dish soap mixed with water is a good choice. You can also use a dedicated shoe cleaner. For suede areas, a suede brush and eraser are necessary. Remember, suede needs special care. If your 9060s have white elements, you might want to prepare a gentle whitening solution. Having everything organized prevents mistakes and makes the job easier. For general shoe cleaning tips, you can check out this guide on [how to clean shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes).

*   **Soft-bristle brush:** Use this for mesh and delicate upper materials.
*   **Medium-bristle brush:** Good for midsoles and outsoles.
*   **Microfiber cloths:** Ideal for wiping away dirt and moisture.
*   **Mild soap:** A small amount mixed with water creates a gentle cleaning solution.
*   **Suede brush and eraser:** Essential for maintaining suede parts.
*   **Small bowl:** For mixing your cleaning solution.
*   **Paper towels or old newspapers:** To stuff inside shoes for drying.

Having these tools ready helps you effectively **clean 9060 New Balance** sneakers. This preparation sets the stage for a successful clean. Remember, proper tools lead to better results and less risk of damage.

## Initial Steps for Cleaning Your 9060 New Balance Shoes

Starting the cleaning process correctly makes a big difference. The first steps focus on removing loose dirt and preparing the shoes. This helps prevent rubbing dirt further into the material. I always begin with these crucial first actions.

First, remove the laces and insoles from your 9060s. Cleaning laces separately helps them get truly clean. Insoles can hold odors and dirt, so taking them out allows them to air out or be cleaned if needed. You can put the laces into a mesh bag and machine wash them with a mild detergent or hand wash them in a bowl of soapy water.

Next, use a soft-bristle brush or an old toothbrush to gently brush off any loose dirt or mud. Do this over a trash can or outside to avoid making a mess. Pay attention to the upper, sides, and bottom of the shoes. This dry brushing step is very important. It removes surface debris before you introduce any moisture. Trying to wet clean shoes with large dirt clumps still attached can spread the dirt around and make stains worse. This initial dry sweep prepares the surface for deeper cleaning. It is a simple step, but it is key to a good outcome when you **clean 9060 New Balance** shoes.

*   **Remove laces and insoles:** This allows for separate, thorough cleaning and easier access to all shoe parts.
*   **Dry brush the entire shoe:** Use a soft brush to remove loose dirt, dust, and mud from the upper, midsole, and outsole.
*   **Shake out debris:** Turn the shoes upside down and tap them to dislodge any small stones or dirt trapped in the sole grooves.
*   **Hand wash laces:** Soak laces in warm, soapy water, gently scrub them, rinse, and set aside to air dry.

These initial actions lay a solid foundation for the wet cleaning that follows. They ensure that you are working with a prepared surface. This helps your cleaning efforts be more effective.

## Deep Cleaning Mesh and Suede on New Balance 9060

The New Balance 9060 often features a mix of mesh and suede materials. Each material needs a specific cleaning approach. Treating them correctly ensures they do not get damaged. I always take extra care when working on these delicate parts.

For the mesh areas, mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water in a bowl. Dip your soft-bristle brush into the solution. Gently scrub the mesh in small, circular motions. Do not saturate the material. Mesh can absorb too much water. This light scrubbing helps lift dirt from the fabric weave. After scrubbing, use a clean, damp microfiber cloth to wipe away the soapy residue. Repeat this process until the mesh looks clean. For white mesh, a paste of baking soda and mild soap can gently brighten the area. This method is similar to cleaning other New Balance models with mesh, like when you [clean New Balance 2002R](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-2002r).

Suede requires more delicate handling. Avoid using too much water. Water can stain or stiffen suede. First, use a dedicated suede brush to gently brush away any dry dirt. Brush in one direction to lift the nap of the suede. If you have scuffs or light stains, use a suede eraser. Gently rub the eraser over the mark. This helps lift the stain without wetting the suede. For tougher spots, dip a small corner of a clean cloth in the mild soap solution. Dab the stain very lightly. Do not rub vigorously. After dabbing, use a dry part of the cloth to blot the area immediately. Let it air dry. Once dry, brush the suede again to restore its texture. Proper suede care is critical when you **clean 9060 New Balance** shoes. You can learn more about specific suede cleaning techniques by reading our article on [how to clean New Balance suede shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-suede-shoes).

*   **Mesh Cleaning:**
    *   Prepare a mild soap and water solution.
    *   Lightly dampen a soft brush with the solution.
    *   Gently scrub mesh in small circles.
    *   Wipe clean with a damp microfiber cloth.
    *   For white mesh, use a baking soda paste for extra brightening.
*   **Suede Cleaning:**
    *   Brush dry suede with a suede brush to remove loose dirt.
    *   Use a suede eraser for scuffs and light stains.
    *   For stubborn spots, lightly dab with a barely damp cloth and mild solution.
    *   Blot dry immediately with a clean, dry cloth.
    *   Restore suede nap by brushing once dry.

Remember, patience and gentle movements are key when cleaning these materials. Rushing can cause damage, especially to the suede. Take your time to preserve the look and feel of your New Balance 9060s.

## Cleaning the Midsoles and Outsoles of Your 9060s

The midsoles and outsoles of your New Balance 9060s can gather a lot of dirt. These parts are often made of rubber or foam. They need a more robust cleaning approach than the delicate upper materials. I find that getting these areas bright makes the whole shoe look new.

For the midsoles, which are usually white or light-colored, mix a slightly stronger solution of mild soap and warm water. You can also use a specialized sneaker cleaner. Dip a medium-bristle brush or an old toothbrush into the solution. Scrub the midsole vigorously. Pay attention to any scuff marks or embedded dirt. The textured surface of the midsole can trap grime. Apply a bit more pressure here compared to the upper. After scrubbing, wipe down the midsole thoroughly with a clean, damp microfiber cloth. For stubborn scuffs on white midsoles, a magic eraser can work wonders. Simply dampen it and gently rub the scuff marks. This technique is also effective for models like the New Balance 990, as detailed in our guide on [how to clean New Balance 990](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-990).

The outsoles, the very bottom of your shoes, are designed to grip the ground. They collect the most dirt and grime. Use the medium-bristle brush and the same cleaning solution. Scrub the outsole thoroughly, getting into all the grooves and treads. A dental pick or toothpick can help remove small stones or compacted dirt from deep grooves. Rinse the brush frequently to prevent spreading dirt. After scrubbing, rinse the outsole under running water or wipe it clean with a very wet cloth. Make sure all soap residue is gone. A clean sole not only looks better but also helps maintain the shoe's grip.

*   **Midsoles:**
    *   Use a medium-bristle brush with a mild soap solution.
    *   Scrub vigorously to remove scuffs and dirt.
    *   Wipe clean with a damp microfiber cloth.
    *   For tough white scuffs, use a magic eraser gently.
*   **Outsoles:**
    *   Scrub with a medium-bristle brush and cleaning solution.
    *   Use a dental pick or toothpick to clear deep grooves.
    *   Rinse thoroughly under water or wipe with a very wet cloth.
    *   Ensure all soap is removed to prevent slipperiness.

Cleaning these sections makes a noticeable difference. It brings back the sharp look of your New Balance 9060s. A clean sole is a sign of a well-maintained shoe.

## Drying Your New Balance 9060 Shoes Safely

Proper drying is as important as cleaning. Incorrect drying can cause damage like shrinkage, material stiffness, or even mildew. After cleaning, your New Balance 9060 shoes need to dry completely and naturally. I always prioritize safe drying to protect my sneakers.

First, gently pat down the shoes with a clean, dry microfiber cloth. This removes excess surface water. Next, stuff the shoes with paper towels or old newspapers. Do not use colored newspaper as the ink can transfer to the shoe lining. The paper helps absorb moisture from inside the shoe. It also helps the shoe keep its shape as it dries. Change the paper every few hours, especially if it feels damp. This speeds up the drying process.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Direct heat, like from a radiator or hairdryer, can damage the adhesives and materials. It can cause the mesh to shrink or the suede to crack. Air circulation is key for effective drying. A fan can help move air around the shoes, but still avoid direct hot air. Allow at least 24-48 hours for the shoes to dry completely. The drying time will vary based on how wet the shoes got and the humidity levels. Before wearing them again, make sure they are dry inside and out. Putting on damp shoes can lead to bad odors and discomfort. This drying method applies to most sneakers, including [how to clean New Balance 327](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-327) models, which also feature mixed materials.

*   **Remove excess water:** Pat down shoes gently with a dry microfiber cloth.
*   **Stuff with paper:** Fill shoes with paper towels or plain newspaper to absorb moisture and maintain shape.
*   **Change paper regularly:** Replace damp paper to speed up drying.
*   **Air dry:** Place shoes in a well-ventilated room.
*   **Avoid direct heat:** Keep shoes away from sunlight, radiators, or hairdryers.
*   **Allow sufficient time:** Let shoes dry for 24-48 hours until completely dry inside.

Following these steps ensures your 9060s dry safely. This preserves their integrity and extends their lifespan. A well-dried shoe feels and looks better.

## Protecting Your New Balance 9060 for Lasting Freshness

Once your New Balance 9060 shoes are clean and dry, protecting them is the next logical step. Prevention is always easier than cleaning. Applying protective measures helps keep your sneakers cleaner for longer. I make sure to protect my shoes after every deep clean.

A water and stain repellent spray is a great investment. Choose one designed for mixed materials like suede and mesh. Before applying, test the spray on a small, hidden area of the shoe. This checks for any discoloration. If safe, spray an even coat over the entire shoe from about 6-8 inches away. Follow the product instructions for drying and reapplication. This spray creates a barrier. It helps repel water and makes it harder for dirt and stains to stick to the shoe's surface. This means less frequent deep cleaning.

Regular light maintenance also plays a big role. After each wear, give your 9060s a quick brush-off. Use a soft brush to remove any surface dust or light dirt. If you notice a fresh mark, try to wipe it off immediately with a damp cloth. Do not let stains set in. Store your shoes in a cool, dry place when not wearing them. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight for long periods. Using shoe trees can help maintain their shape and absorb moisture between wears. These small habits extend the life and fresh look of your New Balance 9060s. This proactive care complements the cleaning process.

*   **Apply protective spray:** Use a water and stain repellent spray suitable for mesh and suede.
*   **Test spray first:** Check for discoloration on a hidden spot.
*   **Apply evenly:** Spray from a recommended distance, following product instructions.
*   **Perform light maintenance:** Brush off shoes after each wear to remove surface dirt.
*   **Address fresh marks:** Wipe off spills immediately with a damp cloth.
*   **Proper storage:** Store shoes in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.
*   **Use shoe trees:** Helps maintain shoe shape and absorb moisture.

These protection tips ensure your hard work cleaning your 9060s lasts. It makes future cleaning easier. Your New Balance 9060s will stay looking great for many adventures.

## Addressing Tough Stains on Your 9060 New Balance

Sometimes, regular cleaning steps are not enough for stubborn stains on your New Balance 9060. These marks need targeted treatment. It is important to know how to handle them without damaging the shoe. I have faced many tough stains and found specific solutions work best.

For oil-based stains on mesh or synthetic parts, try using a small amount of cornstarch or talcum powder. Sprinkle the powder directly onto the stain. Let it sit for several hours or even overnight. The powder helps absorb the oil. After it sits, brush off the powder. Then, proceed with your regular mild soap and water cleaning method for that area. This pre-treatment often loosens the oil.

Mud stains, once dry, should be dry-brushed off first. If the stain remains, prepare a very mild solution of white vinegar and water (1 part vinegar to 4 parts water). Lightly dab the stain with a cloth dampened in this solution. Be very careful with suede; apply this only to mesh or synthetic areas. Blot gently, then wipe with a clean, damp cloth. For scuff marks on white midsoles that a magic eraser cannot remove, a tiny amount of rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab can work. Apply it only to the scuff itself, then wipe immediately. Always test any new cleaning agent on a hidden spot first. This prevents accidental damage. When you really need to **clean 9060 New Balance** shoes from deep stains, patience and precision are key.

*   **Oil stains:**
    *   Apply cornstarch or talcum powder to absorb oil.
    *   Let sit for several hours or overnight.
    *   Brush off powder and then clean with mild soap.
*   **Mud stains (dry):**
    *   Dry brush thoroughly to remove all loose mud.
    *   If stain persists on mesh, dab with a mild white vinegar and water solution.
    *   Wipe immediately with a clean, damp cloth.
*   **Tough midsole scuffs:**
    *   Use a magic eraser.
    *   For very stubborn marks, apply a tiny amount of rubbing alcohol with a cotton swab.
    *   Wipe off alcohol immediately.

Always proceed with caution. Use minimal product and gentle motions. Tough stains require a thoughtful approach to restore your New Balance 9060s.
