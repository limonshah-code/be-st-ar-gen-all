### 30 / i30 – Leak Detected

This code, common in newer GE models, means the dishwasher's leak detection system has sensed water in the base pan. It is similar to the "F" code.

*   **Cause:** A leak from a hose, pump seal, or internal component. Float switch stuck in the "on" position.
*   **Solution:** Disconnect power and water. Access the bottom of the dishwasher and soak up any standing water. Look for the source of the leak, checking hoses and connections. Ensure the float switch at the bottom moves freely. If you find a visible leak, you might need to replace the leaking part.
*   **My Tip:** This is a safety feature. Do not ignore this code. Continuing to run the dishwasher with a leak can cause damage to your floor.

### 40 / i40 – Water Sensor or Level Issue

The 40 or i40 code indicates a problem with the turbidity sensor or the water level sensor. This sensor determines how dirty the water is or how much water is in the tub.

*   **Cause:** Dirty sensor, faulty sensor, or an issue with the control board receiving sensor input.
*   **Solution:** Clean the turbidity sensor, usually located near the drain filter. It looks like a small plastic window. Use a soft cloth and mild detergent. Reset the dishwasher by cycling power. If the problem persists, the sensor might need replacement.
*   **My Tip:** Regular cleaning of the dishwasher helps prevent this sensor from getting coated with residue. Consider learning [how to clean GE Profile dishwasher](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-ge-profile-dishwasher) for detailed cleaning tips that extend to other GE models.

## Heating and Temperature GE Dishwasher Codes

For dishes to get truly clean and dry, the dishwasher needs to reach and maintain specific temperatures. When the heating system malfunctions, your GE dishwasher will display particular troubleshooting codes. These issues can result in dishes that are still wet or not fully sanitized.

### 70 / i70 – Heating Element Problem

The 70 or i70 code indicates that the dishwasher is not heating the water properly. This is essential for effective cleaning and drying.

*   **Cause:** Faulty heating element, defective thermostat, or a wiring issue.
*   **Solution:** First, ensure the dishwasher is getting proper power. Then, you might need to test the heating element for continuity using a multimeter. If the element is open, it needs replacement. Also, check the thermistor (temperature sensor) for proper resistance.
*   **My Tip:** If your dishes are coming out wet, even after using rinse aid, a heating problem is likely. This code confirms it.

### 80 / i80 – Thermistor / Temperature Sensor Fault

This code specifically points to a problem with the thermistor, which is the temperature sensor. The thermistor monitors water temperature for the control board.

*   **Cause:** A defective thermistor or a wiring issue leading to it.
*   **Solution:** The thermistor is often located near the heating element or on the bottom of the tub. You can test its resistance with a multimeter. Resistance values change with temperature; consult your dishwasher's service manual for specific readings. If it reads open or shorted, replace it.
*   **My Tip:** A faulty thermistor can cause cycles to run too long or too short, or not heat at all, leading to dirty or wet dishes.

### 90 / i90 – Temperature Too High

The 90 or i90 code signifies that the dishwasher's internal temperature is too high. This is less common but can occur.

*   **Cause:** Stuck heating relay on the control board, or a faulty thermistor giving an inaccurate high reading.
*   **Solution:** First, power cycle the dishwasher to see if it resets. If the issue persists, the problem might be with the control board. A relay on the board could be stuck in the "on" position, continuously heating the water. A faulty thermistor might also be sending incorrect temperature signals. This often requires professional diagnosis.
*   **My Tip:** If you notice steam excessively, or a burning smell, disconnect power immediately. This code is a serious warning.

### 100 / i100 – Heater Not Active

This code suggests the heater is not becoming active when it should. This is similar to the 70 code but can point to different control logic.

*   **Cause:** Control board issue, wiring to the heating element, or a thermostat problem.
*   **Solution:** Verify power to the heating element during a heating phase. If no power, the control board or its relay is likely at fault. If power is present, but no heat, the element itself is likely bad. Testing component continuity is key here.
*   **My Tip:** Always double-check electrical connections before replacing parts. Loose wires can mimic component failures.

## Motor and Sensor GE Dishwasher Codes

The wash motor and various sensors are vital for your GE dishwasher to perform its cleaning cycles.

If the code persists, the control board itself might be defective. This is usually a component that needs professional diagnosis and replacement.
*   **My Tip:** Control board issues can be frustrating because they are often expensive to fix. Ensure all other potential causes are ruled out first.

### iF – Inlet Fill Issue (similar to E1, but often more persistent)

While E1 primarily points to water *not filling*, iF can indicate a more persistent or deeper issue with the water inlet system or its detection.

*   **Cause:** Water valve not opening, flow meter malfunction, or a control board not sensing water flow correctly.
*   **Solution:** Check water supply and hose as with E1. If those are clear, the water inlet valve itself may be stuck closed or faulty. A flow meter (if present) could also be malfunctioning, sending incorrect signals to the control board. Testing valve continuity and flow meter function requires expertise.
*   **My Tip:** Sometimes, low water pressure can trigger this. Check if other water fixtures in your home have good pressure.

### dS – Door Switch Error

This code means the dishwasher is detecting an issue with the door latch or switch. The dishwasher needs to confirm the door is securely closed before starting or continuing a cycle.

*   **Cause:** Loose door latch, broken door switch, or wiring problem.
*   **Solution:** Check the door latch mechanism for any physical damage or obstruction. Ensure the door closes and latches firmly. The door switch, usually located within the latch assembly, might be faulty. You can test it for continuity if you can access it safely.
*   **My Tip:** Many people forget to push the door completely shut. Give it an extra firm push before troubleshooting further.

### dL – Drain Line Clog (similar to E2/2E, but can imply a more severe blockage)

The dL code points specifically to a significant blockage in the drain line. This prevents water from exiting the dishwasher.

*   **Cause:** Major food debris accumulation, foreign object in the pump, or a very stubborn clog in the drain hose or air gap.
*   **Solution:** Perform a thorough cleaning of the drain filter. Disconnect the drain hose from the sink or garbage disposal and check for blockages. You might need to use a snake to clear a stubborn clog. Also, check the drain pump impeller for any foreign objects.
