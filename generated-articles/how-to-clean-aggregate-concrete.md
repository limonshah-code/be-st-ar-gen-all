Always test any cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area first. This ensures it does not damage or discolor your aggregate concrete. Use appropriate personal protective equipment for all stain removal tasks.

## Power Washing Aggregate Concrete: Best Practices

Power washing is an extremely effective way to clean aggregate concrete. Its high-pressure water stream can remove stubborn dirt, grime, mold, and stains quickly. However, incorrect use can damage the aggregate or the concrete matrix. Careful technique and pressure control are vital for safe and effective cleaning.

### Choosing the Right Pressure

Pressure washers come with various pressure ratings, measured in PSI (pounds per square inch). The textured nature of aggregate concrete means you need to be cautious. Too much pressure can chip away the aggregate or damage the surface.

*   **Residential Use:** For most home use, a pressure washer between 1500-3000 PSI is sufficient. Start with a lower PSI setting, around 1500-2000 PSI, and gradually increase if needed.
*   **Nozzle Selection:**
    *   **25-degree (green) or 40-degree (white) nozzle:** These are generally safe for aggregate concrete. They provide a wider fan of water, distributing the pressure more evenly.
    *   **Rotary (turbo) nozzle:** While powerful for deep cleaning, use with extreme caution. This nozzle delivers a concentrated, pulsating stream that can damage aggregate if held too close or for too long in one spot.
    *   **Black (soap) nozzle:** This wide-angle nozzle is for applying cleaning solutions at low pressure, not for cleaning.
*   **Test Area:** Always test the pressure washer on an inconspicuous area first. Observe how the concrete reacts to the pressure and nozzle choice. This helps you find the right balance without damaging your surface.

### Techniques for Safe Power Washing

Proper technique is crucial for achieving a clean surface without causing damage. Maintain a consistent approach throughout the job. This ensures an even clean and prevents lines or streaks.

1.  **Pre-wet the surface:** Before power washing, wet the entire aggregate concrete surface with a garden hose. This helps to loosen surface dirt and prepares the concrete for cleaning.
2.  **Apply a cleaning solution (optional):** For heavily soiled areas, apply a concrete-specific cleaner using the pressure washer's soap dispenser or a separate sprayer. Let the solution dwell for the recommended time, usually 10-15 minutes. Do not let it dry on the surface.
3.  **Maintain consistent distance:** Hold the nozzle 12-18 inches away from the surface. Adjust closer only if necessary, and with extreme caution. Moving too close can cause etching or damage.
4.  **Use overlapping strokes:** Work in small, manageable sections. Use smooth, overlapping strokes, moving the wand from side to side. Keep the nozzle moving constantly to avoid concentrating pressure in one spot. This prevents uneven cleaning and streaks.
5.  **Rinse thoroughly:** After cleaning each section, rinse off all cleaning solution and loosened debris. Ensure no residue remains. If using a separate cleaner, a second rinse pass might be needed.
6.  **Work downhill:** If your aggregate concrete surface is sloped, start at the highest point and work your way down. This allows dirty water to flow away from areas you have already cleaned.
7.  **Be patient:** Do not rush the process. Take your time to ensure a thorough and even clean. Rushing can lead to missed spots or damage.

Remember that power washing is a powerful tool. Using it responsibly will yield excellent results. It is an ideal method for cleaning larger aggregate concrete surfaces like patios or driveways, including those areas near [concrete pool decks](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-concrete-pool-deck) or [stained concrete patios](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stained-concrete-patio).

## Sealing and Maintenance for Long-Lasting Cleanliness

Cleaning aggregate concrete is only half the battle. To keep it looking its best and protect your investment, you must also consider sealing and regular maintenance. These steps dramatically extend the life and beauty of your exposed aggregate. They also make future cleaning tasks much easier.

### Why Seal Aggregate Concrete?

Sealing your aggregate concrete provides a protective barrier against many common issues. It acts as an invisible shield for the porous concrete surface. This significantly reduces the chances of damage and deep staining.

*   **Stain Resistance:** A sealer fills the tiny pores in the concrete and around the aggregate. This prevents oil, grease, dirt, and other contaminants from penetrating the surface. Spills will sit on top, making them easy to wipe away.
*   **Enhanced Appearance:** Sealers often bring out the natural colors of the exposed aggregate. They can give the surface a wet look or a subtle sheen, enhancing its aesthetic appeal.
*   **Protection from Weather:** Sealers protect against freeze-thaw cycles, which can cause cracking and spalling. They also resist UV rays, preventing the concrete from fading over time.
*   **Reduced Weed Growth:** By filling cracks and crevices, sealers can inhibit weed and moss growth. This keeps your surface looking tidier.
*   **Easier Cleaning:** A sealed surface is much smoother and less porous. Dirt and grime do not stick as easily, making routine cleaning faster and more effective.

### Applying a Sealer

Applying a sealer is a relatively straightforward process once the concrete is perfectly clean and dry. Choose a high-quality sealer designed for exterior concrete and exposed aggregate. There are two main types: penetrating sealers and topical (film-forming) sealers. Penetrating sealers soak into the concrete, offering long-lasting protection. Topical sealers form a protective layer on the surface, often enhancing color.

1.  **Ensure dryness:** The aggregate concrete must be completely dry before sealing. Wait at least 24-48 hours after cleaning, or longer if humidity is high. Moisture trapped under the sealer can cause hazing or failure.
2.  **Choose your sealer:** Select a sealer suitable for your climate and desired finish. Acrylic-based topical sealers are popular for their enhancing properties. Silane/siloxane penetrating sealers offer excellent water repellency without changing the look.
3.  **Read instructions:** Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions for mixing, application, and drying times. Sealer application techniques vary by product.
4.  **Apply evenly:** Use a roller, sprayer, or brush to apply the sealer evenly. Avoid puddling, as this can lead to uneven drying and a patchy finish. Work in small sections.
5.  **Two thin coats:** Most sealers recommend two thin coats rather than one thick one. Allow the first coat to dry according to instructions before applying the second. This provides better protection and a more even finish.
6.  **Cure time:** Allow the sealer to cure completely before allowing foot or vehicle traffic. This can range from 24 hours to several days.

### Routine Maintenance Tips

Consistent maintenance prevents the need for intensive deep cleaning. Simple habits keep your aggregate concrete looking fresh.

*   **Regular sweeping:** Sweep or use a leaf blower frequently to remove loose debris, leaves, and dirt. This prevents organic matter from decomposing and staining the surface.
*   **Immediate spill cleanup:** Clean up spills immediately, especially oil, grease, or colored liquids. The quicker you act, the less likely they are to stain. For general stain advice, refer to [how to clean stains from concrete](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stains-from-concrete).
*   **Hose down:** Periodically hose down the surface with water to remove accumulated dust and light dirt. This is especially helpful in dry climates.
*   **Inspect annually:** Check your aggregate concrete annually for any signs of wear, damage, or new stains. Address minor issues promptly to prevent them from becoming larger problems.
*   **Reapply sealer:** Most sealers need reapplication every 2-5 years, depending on traffic and weather exposure. Watch for signs that the sealer is wearing off, such as water no longer beading on the surface.

By combining thorough cleaning with regular sealing and maintenance, you can ensure your aggregate concrete remains a beautiful and functional part of your property for many years.
