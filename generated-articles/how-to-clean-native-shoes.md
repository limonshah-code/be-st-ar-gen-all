## Understanding Native Shoes: The Material Matters

Native Shoes are special because of their material. They are made from EVA. EVA stands for ethylene-vinyl acetate. This material is super lightweight. It is also waterproof and very comfortable. These shoes float in water. They are also odor-resistant. This makes them perfect for beach days or playing in the park.

EVA foam is unique. It does not absorb water. This means dirt and grime sit on the surface. You can clean them with minimal effort. This material is different from canvas or leather. Those materials require specific cleaning methods. You can learn more about [how to clean canvas shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-canvas-shoes) or [how to clean leather shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-leather-shoes) for other types of footwear. Native Shoes' material makes them incredibly easy to maintain.

This unique property of EVA helps prevent mold too. Water does not soak into the shoe. This limits places for mold to grow. Still, proper drying is important to avoid any issues. If you ever find mold on other shoes, you can find tips on [how to clean mold off shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-shoes). The material of Native Shoes simplifies the cleaning process a lot.

Knowing your shoes are made from EVA changes how you clean them. You do not need harsh chemicals. You also do not need complex tools. Simple household items work best. This saves you time and money.

## Basic Cleaning for Native Shoes: Everyday Dirt and Grime

Cleaning Native Shoes for everyday dirt is very simple. You only need a few basic items. This method works well for mud, dust, and light marks. You can do this quickly after each wear. This prevents dirt from building up.

Here is what you need:
*   A soft brush (like an old toothbrush) or a soft cloth.
*   Mild soap (dish soap works well).
*   A bowl of lukewarm water.

Start by rinsing your shoes. Hold them under running water. This removes loose dirt and mud. For shoes that are very muddy, you can learn more about [how to clean muddy shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-muddy-shoes) effectively before washing. Next, mix a small amount of mild soap with water in a bowl. Create a soapy solution.

Dip your brush or cloth into the soapy water. Gently scrub the surface of the shoes. Pay attention to any visible dirt. The EVA material releases dirt easily. You do not need to scrub hard. Rinse the shoes thoroughly under running water again. Make sure no soap residue remains. Soap residue can attract more dirt later. You will see your Native Shoes become clean quickly.

This basic cleaning keeps your shoes fresh. It is great for people who wear their Native Shoes often. Regular, simple cleaning means less effort in the long run. This method also works well for keeping the overall look of your shoes nice. Many people find this basic cleaning is all their shoes need most of the time.

## Tackling Tougher Stains on Native Shoes

Sometimes, basic cleaning is not enough. Native Shoes can get tough stains. These include scuff marks or discoloration. Certain colors, like white Native Shoes, show dirt more easily. You need specific methods for these issues.

### Removing Scuff Marks

Scuff marks are common on Native Shoes. They usually appear as dark lines. You can remove them with a magic eraser. A magic eraser is a melamine foam sponge. It works like a very fine sandpaper. Wet the magic eraser lightly. Gently rub it over the scuff mark. The mark should lift away. Be gentle with this tool. Rubbing too hard can damage the surface.

For black Native Shoes, scuffs might look white. Use the same magic eraser method. The goal is to lift the transfer. If the scuff remains, try a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball. Gently dab the area. Then wipe it clean with water. You can find more tips on cleaning specific colored shoes in our guide on [how to clean black shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-black-shoes).

### Addressing Discoloration and Yellowing

White Native Shoes can sometimes turn yellow. This happens over time or from sun exposure. To fix yellowing, make a paste. Mix baking soda with a little water. Apply the paste to the yellowed areas. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes. Use a soft brush to scrub the area. Rinse thoroughly. This method often brightens the shoes. For stubborn yellowing, explore our full guide on [how to clean yellow shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-yellow-shoes).

For general stains, look at the type of stain. Oil stains need different treatment than mud. For oil or grease, apply a small amount of mild degreasing soap directly. Rub gently with a cloth. Rinse well. For ink or other tough stains, a tiny amount of rubbing alcohol can work. Always test a small hidden area first. This prevents damage to the shoe. Our article on [how to clean stained shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-stained-shoes) provides more specific advice for various types of stains.

## Deep Cleaning Native Shoes: Machine Washing (When Safe)

You can often machine wash Native Shoes. This is great for a deep clean. It helps when shoes are very dirty or smelly. However, you must follow important steps. Incorrect machine washing can damage your shoes.

First, remove any insoles or laces. Clean them separately. You can hand wash insoles with soap and water. Put the shoes inside a mesh laundry bag. This protects them from harsh tumbling. It also protects your washing machine.

Use a gentle cycle. Choose cold water. Use a small amount of mild detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach. Bleach can damage the EVA material. It can also change the shoe color. Set your machine to a delicate or gentle wash cycle. A short wash time is usually enough. For a comprehensive guide on this process, read our tips on [how to clean shoes in the washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer).

After the wash cycle, remove the shoes immediately. Do not put them in a dryer. High heat will shrink or warp the EVA material. This damage is permanent. Air drying is the only safe way. Place them in a well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight. Sunlight can also cause warping or yellowing over time.

Machine washing is convenient. It is a good option for heavily soiled shoes. Just remember to be gentle. Always prioritize air drying. Your Native Shoes will come out clean and fresh.

## Freshening Up the Inside of Your Native Shoes

The inside of your Native Shoes can get dirty. Sweat and dirt build up. This leads to odors. Keeping the inside clean is just as important as the outside. It improves comfort and hygiene.

Native Shoes are designed to be odor-resistant. But over time, all shoes can develop smells. To clean the inside, first remove any removable insoles. Wash them separately by hand. Use warm, soapy water. Scrub gently with a soft brush. Rinse thoroughly and air dry completely before putting them back.

For the inside of the shoe, create a mild soap solution. Use a clean cloth or sponge. Wipe down the entire interior. Pay attention to the footbed. You can use a small amount of baking soda. Sprinkle it inside the shoes. Let it sit overnight. Baking soda absorbs odors. Then, shake out the powder the next morning. This helps remove lingering smells.

For strong odors, you might need extra steps. Place dryer sheets inside the shoes overnight. You can also use activated charcoal inserts. These absorb moisture and odors. For comprehensive advice on removing shoe odors, check our guide on [how to clean smelly shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-smelly-shoes). Keeping the inside clean makes your shoes more pleasant to wear.

Proper cleaning of the inside prevents bacteria growth. This extends the life of your shoes. It also keeps your feet healthy. Regular interior cleaning is part of full shoe care. This step ensures your Native Shoes are fresh from heel to toe.

## Restoring Shine and Preventing Issues with Native Shoes

Cleaning Native Shoes brings them back to life. But you can do more. You can help them keep their shine. You can also prevent future problems. Regular maintenance is key.

After cleaning, make sure your shoes are completely dry. This prevents mold and strange smells. Once dry, you can apply a protectant spray. Choose one designed for rubber or synthetic materials. These sprays add a layer of protection. They can repel water and resist stains. This makes future cleaning easier. Always follow the product instructions. Test it on a small, hidden area first.

Store your Native Shoes properly. Keep them in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight. Sunlight can cause the EVA material to yellow or warp over time. If you have white Native Shoes, this is especially important. Our guide on [how to clean white shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes) offers more tips on keeping them bright. Do not store them in hot places like a car trunk. High heat will damage the material.

If your shoes become discolored, you can try certain steps. Sometimes, white shoes can turn yellow or look dull. A baking soda paste (baking soda and water) can help restore brightness. Apply it, let it sit, then scrub and rinse. This often works wonders. For darker shoes, discoloration might be less obvious. Regular washing keeps colors vibrant.

Check your shoes regularly for minor issues. Address small scuffs or dirt quickly. This prevents them from becoming major problems. With proper care, your Native Shoes will look great for many seasons.

## Drying Your Native Shoes Properly: Crucial Steps

Drying Native Shoes correctly is vital. Incorrect drying can cause permanent damage. The EVA material is sensitive to heat. Always prioritize air drying. Never use high heat sources.

After washing, shake off excess water from your shoes. You can pat them dry with a clean towel. This removes much of the surface moisture. Do not wring or twist them. This can distort their shape.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area. A spot indoors with good airflow is ideal. You can put them near an open window. Avoid direct sunlight. While sun can dry things, direct, strong sunlight can cause the EVA to warp. It can also cause white shoes to yellow. For any type of shoe that gets wet, air drying is often the best choice, as detailed in our advice on [how to clean water shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-water-shoes).

You can stuff the shoes with paper towels or newspaper. This helps absorb moisture from the inside. It also helps them keep their shape as they dry. Change the paper when it feels damp. Do not use colored newspaper. The ink might transfer to your shoes.

Drying time will vary. It depends on how wet the shoes are and your environment. It can take several hours to a full day. Ensure they are completely dry before wearing them again. Wearing damp shoes can lead to odor and discomfort. It also promotes germ growth. Patience is key in this step. Proper drying extends the life and comfort of your Native Shoes.
