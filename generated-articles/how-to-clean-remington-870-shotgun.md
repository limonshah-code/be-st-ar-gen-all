## How to Clean Your Remington 870 Shotgun Effectively

Your Remington 870 shotgun is a reliable workhorse. Keeping it in top shape requires regular care. I know the feeling of having a trusty firearm. Just like any tool you depend on, a shotgun performs best when it is clean. This simple guide helps you clean your Remington 870 shotgun. It covers what you need, how to take it apart, clean each part, and put it back together.

### Takeaway

Regular cleaning helps your Remington 870 last a long time. It also keeps you safe. Follow these steps for the best results:
*   Gather all your cleaning supplies before you start.
*   Always ensure the shotgun is unloaded before disassembling it.
*   Clean the barrel, action, and trigger group thoroughly.
*   Apply a thin coat of lubricant to moving parts.
*   Reassemble and check for proper function.

To clean your Remington 870 shotgun, first unload it and take it apart. Then, clean the barrel, action, and trigger parts with appropriate solvents and brushes. After cleaning, lubricate the moving parts and put the shotgun back together. This process keeps your shotgun working well and prevents damage.

## Why Cleaning Your Remington 870 Matters

You own a Remington 870 shotgun. It is a tool for sport, defense, or work. Like any machine, it needs proper care to function. Cleaning your shotgun makes sure it works when you need it most. It also keeps you safe during use.

Fouling builds up inside the barrel and action when you shoot. This fouling comes from gunpowder, primers, and bullet residue. Over time, this buildup can cause problems. It affects accuracy and gun reliability. This means your shots might not hit where you aim.

Dirt and debris can also enter the shotgun. This happens during field use or storage. These particles can scratch metal parts. They can also jam the action. A clean shotgun cycles smoothly every time. A dirty one might fail to load or eject shells.

Rust is another big enemy. Moisture can cause rust to form on metal surfaces. Cleaning helps remove moisture and apply protective oils. This prevents rust from forming. Rust weakens metal parts and makes your shotgun unsafe to use. Regular cleaning extends the life of your firearm. It protects your investment.

### Benefits of Regular Shotgun Maintenance

Regular maintenance offers many benefits. It keeps your Remington 870 ready for any task. First, it ensures reliability. A clean gun fires every time you pull the trigger. You do not want a malfunction when it matters most.

Second, it improves accuracy. A clean barrel has less friction for the shot or slug. This allows for a more consistent flight path. You hit your target more often. Third, regular cleaning extends the gun's life. It prevents wear and tear on internal parts. This saves you money on repairs.

Lastly, it helps with safety. Dirty parts can cause unintended discharges. They can also lead to misfires. A well-maintained shotgun works as designed. This makes it safer for you and for others. This kind of care for your shotgun is similar to taking care of any important tool you own.

### When to Clean Your Shotgun

The best time to clean your shotgun is after every use. This is true even if you only fire a few rounds. Residue starts to harden inside the barrel quickly. Cleaning it promptly makes the job easier. It also prevents long-term damage.

If you shoot many rounds, clean it immediately. Heavy shooting puts more stress on the gun. It also creates more fouling. For hunting or field use, clean it as soon as you get home. Moisture and dirt from outside can cause problems if left untreated.

Even if you do not shoot your Remington 870, check it often. I check my guns every few months. Look for dust, lint, or signs of rust. Apply a fresh coat of oil if needed. Proper storage in a dry place also helps. But a quick wipe-down and inspection are always good.

## Essential Tools and Supplies for Remington 870 Cleaning

Having the right tools makes cleaning your Remington 870 easy and effective. You do not need a huge collection. A basic kit provides everything you need. Gather these items before you start cleaning. This saves time and avoids interruptions.

First, you need a safe cleaning area. A workbench or sturdy table works well. Cover it with old newspapers or a mat. This protects the surface from solvents and oils. It also catches any small parts you might drop. Good lighting is also very helpful.

Next, you need a bore snake or cleaning rod. A bore snake is a quick option for the barrel. A cleaning rod offers more thorough scrubbing. Choose a rod that is long enough for your shotgun barrel. It should also have a plastic or coated rod to prevent scratching the bore.

Brushes are also important. You need a bore brush, a chamber brush, and a utility brush. Bore brushes typically come in brass, nylon, or phosphor bronze. Brass works well for most tasks. Nylon is softer for light cleaning. Phosphor bronze is for heavy carbon buildup. The chamber brush cleans the area where the shell sits. The utility brush cleans other parts.

Finally, you need cleaning patches and cotton swabs. Cleaning patches absorb solvent and wipe away fouling. Cotton swabs reach small areas. You can also use old rags or paper towels. Make sure they are lint-free.

### Basic Cleaning Kit Components

A standard shotgun cleaning kit usually contains these items. You will find a cleaning rod with different attachments. It often includes a bore brush, a patch holder, and a cotton mop. These are good starting points for any new gun owner. I always start with these basic tools.

You also need a quality gun cleaning solvent. Solvents dissolve gunpowder residue and carbon. They also remove lead and copper fouling. Choose a solvent that is safe for your gun's finish. Many brands offer "all-in-one" cleaners that also lubricate. However, I prefer separate solvent and oil.

Gun oil or lubricant is essential. It protects metal parts from rust. It also reduces friction between moving parts. This ensures smooth operation. A thin, even coat is all you need. Do not over-lubricate. Too much oil attracts dirt.

Gloves protect your hands from harsh chemicals. Safety glasses protect your eyes from splashes. These are simple safety items that everyone should use. You can often find a good kit specifically for shotguns. These kits typically contain the right sizes for your Remington 870.

### Specialized Remington 870 Cleaning Items

The Remington 870 is a pump-action shotgun. It has a specific design. Some items help with this design. A specialized shotgun cleaning kit often includes an appropriate bore brush size (usually 12 gauge for most 870s). You might also find a sturdy cleaning vise. This holds your shotgun still during cleaning. It makes the process safer and easier.

A choke tube wrench is also necessary if your 870 has changeable choke tubes. You need to remove the choke tube for proper barrel cleaning. This also lets you clean the choke tube itself. Carbon can build up inside. This buildup can make removing the choke difficult later.

Some cleaners specialize in heavy carbon or plastic wad fouling. Shotguns often accumulate a lot of plastic residue from shotshell wads. A dedicated plastic wad remover can be very helpful. These come in a spray or foam form. They dissolve the plastic. This is important for thorough barrel cleaning.

Remember, a good cleaning mat or pad is invaluable. It protects your gun's finish and your work surface. Look for one with a non-slip backing. This prevents your gun from sliding around. A few soft rags are also useful for wiping down the exterior. These small things make a big difference.

## Safe Disassembly of Your Remington 870 Shotgun

Safety is the most important step before you clean your Remington 870. Never start cleaning until you confirm the shotgun is unloaded. This rule applies to all firearms. I always double-check, even if I am sure. It only takes a second.

First, point the shotgun in a safe direction. Always treat every gun as if it is loaded. This mindset prevents accidents. Remove any ammunition from the area. This includes shells on your workbench. You do not want to accidentally load the gun while cleaning.

Next, open the action. Pull the slide assembly back to its rearmost position. Look into the chamber. Make sure there is no shell present. Then, check the magazine tube. Look inside the loading port. Ensure no shells are in the tube.

If you have shells in the magazine, press the shell stop on the right side. Pull the shell out. Repeat this until the magazine is empty. Once you confirm the gun is empty, you can start the disassembly process. Disassembly is straightforward for the Remington 870. It does not require special tools for basic field stripping.

### Safety Checks Before Disassembly

Before touching any part, always perform a visual and physical check. Look into the chamber and the magazine tube. Then, use your finger to feel inside. Make sure no ammunition is present anywhere. I always perform this check three times. This ensures safety.

After checking for ammunition, point the shotgun in a safe direction. Now, dry fire the shotgun. This releases the hammer or firing pin. It takes tension off the springs. This makes disassembly easier and safer.

Keep your fingers away from the trigger during disassembly. Your hands should only touch the parts you are removing. Be mindful of where the muzzle points at all times. Even when disassembled, parts of the gun can still cause harm if handled improperly.

Set aside your ammunition. Store it in a different room or a locked container. This prevents any confusion. Now you are ready to begin taking the gun apart.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

Disassembling your Remington 870 for cleaning is simple. Follow these steps:

1.  **Remove the Magazine Cap:** Unscrew the cap at the end of the magazine tube. Twist it counter-clockwise. Set it aside with the spring and follower. These are small parts.
2.  **Remove the Barrel:** With the magazine cap off, you can now slide the barrel forward and off the receiver. Hold the fore-end assembly slightly back. The barrel should slide free. Some models have an extended magazine tube. For these, a barrel clamp might hold the barrel in place. Remove any clamps first.
3.  **Remove the Fore-End and Action Bars:** Slide the fore-end assembly and action bars forward off the magazine tube. This part often feels a bit stiff. Work it gently.
4.  **Remove the Trigger Group:** Look for two pins on the receiver. These pins hold the trigger group in place. Use a punch or the back of a screwdriver to push these pins out. Push them from right to left. Once the pins are out, the entire trigger group drops out of the bottom of the receiver. This part houses many small components. Handle it carefully.
5.  **Remove the Bolt and Carrier:** Pull the bolt and carrier assembly out from the front of the receiver. It slides forward. This assembly often comes out as one piece. You do not usually need to disassemble the bolt itself for general cleaning.

Now you have your main components separated. You have the barrel, receiver, trigger group, bolt and carrier, and fore-end with action bars. Place them on your cleaning mat. You are now ready to clean each part. Remember to keep track of all small pins and springs.

## Thorough Cleaning of the Barrel and Choke Tubes

The barrel is where the action happens. It sees the most fouling. Cleaning it well is crucial for accuracy and gun life. A dirty barrel leads to inconsistent shot patterns. It also causes pressure spikes. This can be dangerous.

Start with your bore cleaning solvent. Apply it generously to a patch or a bore snake. If using a cleaning rod, attach a bore brush of the correct gauge. Push the brush through the barrel from the chamber end. Push it all the way out the muzzle. Do not reverse direction while the brush is still in the barrel. This can damage the rifling or bore.

Brush the barrel several times. Then, switch to a patch holder. Push solvent-soaked patches through until they come out reasonably clean. You might need many patches. After that, run dry patches through. Continue until they come out perfectly clean. Look through the barrel to check. It should shine.

Plastic wad fouling is common in shotgun barrels. It looks like streaks of plastic. Special plastic wad removers help. Apply the remover and let it soak. Then brush again. This removes the stubborn plastic.

### Cleaning the Shotgun Barrel

Always clean the barrel from the breech (chamber) end if possible. This protects the muzzle crown. The muzzle crown is the very end of the barrel. It helps gas exit evenly. Damage to the crown harms accuracy. Using a bore guide helps keep the cleaning rod centered.

After brushing and patching, use a cotton mop. Apply a light coat of gun oil to the mop. Run it through the barrel once. This leaves a thin protective layer. It prevents rust. Do not use too much oil. A thin film is enough.

Inspect the barrel carefully. Use a bore light if you have one. Look for any remaining fouling or streaks. Check for pitting or corrosion. If you see any, you may need more aggressive cleaning. This usually means a longer soak time with the solvent.

Cleaning the barrel regularly keeps your shotgun shooting straight. It also prevents premature wear. I always spend extra time on the barrel. It is the heart of the shotgun.

### Maintaining Choke Tubes

Most Remington 870s use interchangeable choke tubes. You need to clean these too. Carbon and plastic fouling build up inside them. This buildup changes the choke's constriction. It affects your shot pattern.

First, remove the choke tube from the barrel. Use your choke tube wrench. Unscrew it. Be careful not to cross-thread it when reinserting. Inspect the threads on both the choke tube and the barrel. Clean them with a utility brush.

Apply solvent to the choke tube. Use a small brush or cotton swab to scrub the inside and outside. Pay attention to the threads. This is where fouling often collects. Let the solvent work for a few minutes. Then wipe it clean with a rag.

After cleaning, apply a very thin layer of anti-seize compound to the choke tube threads. This prevents the choke tube from seizing in the barrel. It makes future removal easy. Screw the choke tube back into the barrel. Tighten it hand-tight, then use the wrench for a final snug twist. Do not overtighten it. Overtightening can damage the choke or barrel.

## Cleaning the Remington 870 Action and Receiver

The action is the engine of your shotgun. It loads, fires, and ejects shells. Dirt and grime here cause malfunctions. The receiver houses the action parts. Keeping these areas clean ensures smooth operation.

Use a gun cleaning solvent and a utility brush. Spray solvent into the receiver. Scrub all surfaces vigorously. Pay attention to the shell lifter, bolt rails, and ejector. Carbon and unburnt powder collect in these areas. Use cotton swabs to reach tight spots.

Scrub the inside of the receiver. Get into all the corners and crevices. The Remington 870 receiver is sturdy. But it still needs careful cleaning. Use small brushes to get into the nooks.

After scrubbing, wipe away all loosened grime with a clean rag. Make sure no dirty solvent remains. You want to remove all traces of fouling. Compressed air can help blow out stubborn dirt. Just be careful not to blow dirt deeper into other parts.

### Addressing the Bolt and Carrier

The bolt and carrier assembly moves back and forth. It holds the shell during firing. It also extracts spent casings. This part collects a lot of carbon. Clean it thoroughly.

Spray solvent on the bolt face. This is where the primer strikes the shell. Carbon builds up here. Use a stiff brush to scrub the bolt face. Pay attention to the extractor and ejector ports. These are small parts that can get gummed up. Use a small pick or cotton swab if needed.

Clean the carrier. This is the part that moves the shell from the magazine to the chamber. Wipe down all surfaces. Ensure the action bars are clean too. They connect the fore-end to the bolt and carrier. Wipe them down with solvent and a rag. Remove any old grease or dirt.

Inspect the bolt for wear. Check the firing pin channel for obstructions. Make sure the extractor moves freely. A small amount of carbon or debris can stop these parts from working right. Cleaning them well prevents failures.

### Cleaning the Receiver Interior

The receiver interior is like a house for all the moving parts. It needs to be clean. Focus on the bolt rails. These are the tracks where the bolt slides. Wipe them down until they are smooth. Any grit here will make the action feel rough.

Check the magazine tube. Clean the outside of the tube where the fore-end slides. Clean the inside of the tube too. Use a cleaning rod with a patch or a bore brush designed for small tubes. Carbon and lint can build up inside the magazine tube. This prevents shells from feeding properly.

The shell stops are also in the receiver. They hold shells in the magazine tube. Make sure they are free of debris. Use a cotton swab to clean around them. They need to move freely to feed shells smoothly.

Ensure no old oil or grease remains in the receiver. Fresh lubrication needs a clean surface to work best. You want the metal to feel clean and dry before oiling. A clean receiver means a smooth action. A smooth action means reliable performance. Remember, this is a distinct task from cleaning a semi-auto shotgun. The mechanics are different, so the focus areas for cleaning also vary.

## Lubrication and Reassembly of Your Remington 870

Cleaning is only half the job. Lubrication protects your shotgun and ensures smooth function. Proper reassembly is also key. It makes sure your Remington 870 works safely after cleaning.

Start with a light gun oil. Apply a thin coat to all moving metal parts. You do not need a lot of oil. A thin film is enough. Too much oil attracts dirt and grime. It can also cause problems in cold weather.

Focus on the bolt rails. Apply a small drop of oil to each rail. Then spread it evenly. Lubricate the action bars. Apply a tiny amount to the exterior of the magazine tube where the fore-end slides. This reduces friction.

Put a small drop of oil on the bolt lugs. These lock into the barrel extension. Also, oil the firing pin. Put a tiny drop on the trigger group pins before reinserting them. This helps them go in smoothly.

The goal is to reduce metal-on-metal friction. This prevents wear. It also makes the action feel slick. A well-lubricated shotgun operates quietly and reliably.

### Proper Lubrication Points

Specific points need lubrication on your Remington 870. Pay attention to these areas:
*   **Bolt Rails:** These are the channels inside the receiver where the bolt slides. A thin line of oil here makes the action smooth.
*   **Action Bars:** These connect the fore-end to the bolt. Lubricate the top and bottom surfaces.
*   **
