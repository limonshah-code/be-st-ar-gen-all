Cleaning the inside of a straw requires specific tools. These tools help you reach every part. They ensure a thorough clean. Using the right tools makes the job easier. It also makes it more effective.

You do not need many items. Most tools are easy to find. Some straw sets include cleaning brushes. If your set does not, you can buy them separately. These simple items help you maintain clean straws every day.

### The Mighty Straw Brush

A straw brush is your best friend. It is a long, thin brush. It has bristles all around. These bristles scrub the inner walls of the straw. Straw brushes come in different sizes. Make sure you get one that fits your straw's width.

To use it, wet the brush. Add a drop of soap. Push the brush through the straw. Move it back and forth. Do this from both ends. This action removes all stuck bits. It gets rid of all the residue inside.

### My Straw Looks Cloudy or Discolored

### There's Something Stuck Inside My Straw

Sometimes, a piece of fruit or thick smoothie remains.

*   **Use the brush aggressively:** Push the straw brush through with more force. Try from both ends.

If a piece is very hard, repeat soaking and scrubbing. Patience is key.

### Preventing Sticky Residue

Sticky residue makes cleaning harder. It also attracts more grime.
