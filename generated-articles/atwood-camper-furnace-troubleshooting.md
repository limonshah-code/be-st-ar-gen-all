### Main Query Answer

Troubleshooting an Atwood camper furnace involves checking power, propane supply, and ignition. Start by ensuring adequate battery voltage and a full propane tank. Next, verify the thermostat setting. Finally, listen for the blower motor and igniter attempting to light the burner.

### Understanding Your Atwood Camper Furnace System

Your Atwood camper furnace provides essential warmth for your recreational vehicle. This system operates on propane and 12-volt DC power. Understanding its basic components helps with troubleshooting. The furnace draws air from inside the camper. It then heats this air using a propane burner. A blower motor pushes the heated air through ducts.

Key parts include the thermostat, which controls the furnace. The control board manages all operations. The igniter lights the propane. A flame sensor confirms the flame. The sail switch ensures proper airflow before ignition. These parts must work together for heat production. If one component fails, the entire system stops.

Proper function ensures comfort. A well-maintained furnace uses propane efficiently. This system is different from residential furnaces. It is designed for mobile use. Regular checks keep it working reliably. Knowing what each part does makes troubleshooting easier. You can isolate problems quickly.

### No Heat? Check Power & Thermostat Settings

A furnace that produces no heat often points to power or thermostat problems. Start your Atwood camper furnace troubleshooting by checking these basic elements. First, verify your RV's 12-volt DC power supply. The furnace needs consistent power to operate the blower motor and control board. Low battery voltage is a common culprit. Ensure your house batteries are charged. Test them with a multimeter if you suspect an issue.

Next, inspect the furnace fuse. RV furnaces usually have a dedicated fuse in the power center. A blown fuse cuts off power to the furnace. Replace any blown fuses with a fuse of the correct amperage. A fuse that blows repeatedly suggests a deeper electrical problem.

Then, examine your thermostat. Make sure it is set to "Heat" mode. The temperature setting should be higher than the current RV interior temperature. If your thermostat uses batteries, replace them. A faulty thermostat might not send the correct signals to the furnace. Some thermostats have a small display; ensure it shows power. If you have an older RV, a simple mechanical thermostat might be stuck. Consider checking another RV system, like your water heater, to confirm power is flowing. You can troubleshoot your [Atwood camper water heater](https://beacleaner.com/atwood-camper-water-heater-troubleshooting) if that also shows issues.

Confirm the furnace ON/OFF switch is in the "ON" position. Some RVs have a separate power switch for the furnace. This switch might be located near the furnace unit itself. Always begin with these simple power and thermostat checks. They resolve many common furnace problems quickly.

### Blower Runs, No Heat: Propane & Ignition Issues

If your Atwood camper furnace blower motor runs but no heat comes out, the problem likely involves propane supply or the ignition system. This indicates the furnace receives power and the fan operates. However, it fails to light the burner. First, check your propane tanks. Ensure they are full. Also, confirm the main propane valve on the tank is fully open. Sometimes, an auto-changeover regulator might get stuck. Try cycling the tank valves. Close both, then slowly open one.

Next, check for air in the propane lines. After refueling or opening tanks, air can get trapped. Run other propane appliances, like the stove burners or refrigerator, for a few minutes. This purges air from the lines. You might hear the igniter click multiple times without the burner lighting. This is the furnace trying to ignite.

The ignition system is crucial. The furnace's igniter (sometimes called a DSI igniter for Direct Spark Ignition) creates a spark to light the propane. The flame sensor, usually a small metal rod, detects if the flame has lit. If the sensor does not detect a flame, the furnace shuts off the gas for safety. This prevents unburnt propane from accumulating. Dirt or carbon buildup on the igniter or flame sensor can prevent them from working correctly. These parts are often visible near the burner tube. For detailed ignition system checks on specific models, you might consult resources like an [Atwood 8535 IV DCLP troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/atwood-8535-iv-dclp-troubleshooting) guide.

You may need to clean the igniter and flame sensor. Use fine sandpaper or a wire brush to gently clean their surfaces. Be careful not to bend them. A misaligned or damaged igniter will not create a spark. A faulty flame sensor will not confirm the flame, leading to shutdown. If you suspect issues with other furnace types, knowledge about a [Suburban camper furnace troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/suburban-camper-furnace-troubleshooting) guide could provide comparative insights into different RV furnace systems.

### Blower Doesn't Run: Fan & Control Board Problems

When your Atwood camper furnace blower motor does not run at all, despite the thermostat calling for heat, the issue lies with the blower itself or the control board. The blower motor is essential. It moves air through the furnace and out into your RV. If it fails, the furnace cannot start its heating cycle.

First, listen for any sounds when you turn on the furnace. A humming sound without the fan spinning indicates a seized motor or an obstruction. Check the fan blades for debris like leaves or pet hair. Clear any blockages gently. Sometimes, the motor bearings wear out. This causes the motor to seize or run slowly. Replacing the blower motor might be necessary if it is seized.

The sail switch is another common point of failure. This safety switch ensures the blower pushes enough air before the burner ignites. If the sail switch does not detect sufficient airflow, it prevents the furnace from starting. This protects against overheating and carbon monoxide buildup. The switch can get stuck or accumulate lint, preventing it from closing. Locate the sail switch, usually near the blower fan, and ensure it moves freely. Clean any lint or dust around it. If it remains stuck, it may need replacement.

Finally, the control board manages all furnace operations. It receives signals from the thermostat. It then sends power to the blower motor, igniter, and gas valve. A faulty control board can prevent the blower from starting. It can also cause intermittent operation. You might see a fault code on the thermostat if your system supports it. Troubleshooting a control board involves testing for voltage at different points, which can be complex. Sometimes, simply resetting the furnace by turning off its power for a few minutes helps. If these steps do not resolve the issue, you might have a bad control board. This requires professional diagnosis or replacement. This issue is similar across various furnace types, so insights from general furnace maintenance like how to clean a furnace filter can be useful. Consider general maintenance on your systems, like learning [how to clean a furnace filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-furnace-filter), as blockages can impact airflow and system operation.

### Intermittent Operation & Cycling Issues

An Atwood camper furnace that cycles on and off too frequently, or operates intermittently, signals several potential issues. This behavior indicates the furnace starts, runs for a short period, then shuts down. It often tries to restart shortly after. This is known as short cycling.

One common cause is restricted airflow. The furnace needs good airflow for proper combustion and heat exchange. Check all return air vents inside your RV for obstructions. Ensure they are not blocked by furniture or debris. Similarly, inspect the supply registers. Make sure nothing impedes the heated air from entering your living space. Blocked vents cause the furnace to overheat. The high-limit switch then shuts it down for safety. This cycle repeats when the furnace cools.

The high-limit switch itself can also be faulty. This switch trips if the furnace gets too hot, typically due to airflow issues or a defective component. If the switch is too sensitive or damaged, it might trip prematurely. This causes the furnace to short cycle even when airflow is adequate. Replacing a faulty high-limit switch restores normal operation.

Another issue can be a problem with the flame sensor or igniter. If the flame sensor intermittently fails to detect the flame, the furnace shuts off the gas. It then attempts to re-ignite. This creates a cycle of starting and stopping. Cleaning these components thoroughly can resolve this. Sometimes, the gas pressure might be too low or fluctuating. This causes the flame to become unstable, leading to intermittent detection by the flame sensor. Check propane regulator pressure if you suspect this. Comparing behavior with other RV furnaces like the [Dometic RV furnace troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/dometic-rv-furnace-troubleshooting) guide might offer additional perspectives on intermittent issues.

Finally, a failing control board can also cause intermittent operation. It might send inconsistent signals to the furnace components. This results in unpredictable cycling. While cleaning and checking simpler components first, a persistent cycling issue might point to the control board.

### Maintenance Tips for Peak Furnace Performance

Regular maintenance ensures your Atwood camper furnace performs reliably. Proactive care prevents many common breakdowns. I find that a few simple tasks annually make a big difference. First, regularly inspect the exterior furnace vents. These are often located on the side of your RV. Ensure they are free from dirt, insect nests, or debris. Blocked vents restrict airflow. This can cause the furnace to overheat and shut down. Use a soft brush or vacuum to clear any obstructions.

Next, focus on the interior components. Remove the furnace access panel, usually from inside the RV or through an exterior compartment. Carefully clean the area around the burner and igniter. Dust and lint accumulate here. This affects ignition and combustion efficiency. Use compressed air to blow away debris from the burner assembly and heat exchanger fins. Be gentle; these parts are delicate.

Check the wiring connections. Ensure all electrical connections are secure and free from corrosion. Loose connections cause intermittent power delivery. This can lead to furnace malfunctions. Apply dielectric grease to protect against moisture and corrosion if necessary. You might find general guidance on furnace filter maintenance useful for any furnace, even an RV one. Learning [how to clean a furnace filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-furnace-filter) can improve overall system performance.

Inspect your propane system annually. Check propane hoses for cracks or signs of wear. Ensure all propane connections are tight. A soapy water solution helps detect leaks. Bubbles indicate a leak. Test the propane regulator for proper pressure output. Low pressure causes ignition issues. Refer to your Atwood furnace manual for specific maintenance schedules. Consistent maintenance extends the life of your furnace. It also ensures warm, trouble-free travels.
