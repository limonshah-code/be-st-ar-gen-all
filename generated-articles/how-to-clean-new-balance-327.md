## Keep Your New Balance 327s Fresh: A Cleaning Guide

Your New Balance 327 shoes are a blend of style and comfort. They often feature a mix of materials like mesh, nylon, suede, and sometimes leather. Keeping them clean helps them look great and last longer. Dirt and grime can break down materials over time. This guide will show you exactly how to clean New Balance 327 shoes effectively. We will cover preparing your shoes, specific steps for each material, and important drying tips.

### Takeaway:

*   **Remove Loose Dirt:** Always start by brushing off dry debris.
*   **Target Materials:** Use specific methods for mesh/nylon, suede, and rubber.
*   **Air Dry Safely:** Never use direct heat sources to dry your shoes.
*   **Protect After Cleaning:** Apply protectants to keep them cleaner longer.

To clean your New Balance 327 shoes, gently brush off loose dirt. Use a mild soap solution with a soft brush for mesh and nylon. Treat suede areas with a specialized cleaner and brush. Wipe midsoles clean. Air dry completely away from direct heat.

## Essential Tools for Cleaning Your New Balance 327s

Having the right tools makes cleaning your New Balance 327 shoes much easier. You do not need many fancy items. Simple household goods often work best. Using the correct tools also protects your shoe materials. This section covers what you will need for a thorough cleaning.

First, gather a few soft-bristle brushes. An old toothbrush works well for small areas and scrubbing midsoles. A larger, softer brush, like a shoe brush or an old cleaning brush, is good for the main upper. Second, you need some cleaning solutions. A mild dish soap mixed with water is a great general cleaner. For suede parts, a specific suede cleaner and brush are best.

You will also need a few clean cloths or microfiber towels. These are useful for wiping down surfaces and drying. A bowl of clean water is essential for rinsing your brush. Finally, paper towels or old newspapers are helpful for stuffing the shoes. This helps them keep their shape during drying. Having everything ready before you start saves time and effort. Preparing your cleaning station prevents interruptions.

## Preparing Your New Balance 327s for Cleaning

Proper preparation is key before you start scrubbing your shoes. This step removes surface dirt and protects certain parts. Taking time now saves you effort later. It also helps achieve a better cleaning result.

Begin by removing the shoelaces and insoles from your New Balance 327s. You can wash these separately. The laces might go into a mesh bag and through the washing machine. Insoles can be hand-washed with mild soap and air-dried. Next, use a soft-bristle brush or an old toothbrush to remove loose dirt. Brush off any mud, dust, or debris from the upper, midsole, and outsole. This prevents dirt from turning into mud when you add water.

After brushing, you can gently tap the shoes together to dislodge stubborn dirt from the sole. Inspect your shoes for any specific stains that might need special attention. For general shoe cleaning tips that apply to many types of footwear, you can read more here: [How To Clean Shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes). Preparing your shoes correctly ensures the main cleaning process is more effective. It also helps keep different parts of the shoe cleaner.

## Gentle Cleaning for Mesh and Nylon on New Balance 327

The New Balance 327 often features a large portion of mesh or nylon on its upper. These materials are lightweight and breathable. They require a gentle touch to avoid damage. Cleaning them properly keeps their appearance fresh without causing wear.

Start by mixing a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water in a bowl. You want a foamy solution. Dip a soft-bristle brush or a clean cloth into this solution. Gently scrub the mesh and nylon areas in small circular motions. Do not press too hard. The goal is to lift dirt from the fibers, not to push it deeper. Work on one section at a time.

Once you have scrubbed a section, wipe it with a clean, damp cloth. This removes the soap residue and lifted dirt. Repeat this process until the entire mesh and nylon upper looks clean. Be careful not to oversaturate the material with water. Too much water can make drying harder and potentially damage inner components. This method keeps the delicate fabric safe.

## Caring for Suede and Leather Accents on Your New Balance 327

Many New Balance 327 models feature suede or leather accents. These materials need different care than mesh. Suede is particularly delicate and can be easily damaged by water. Leather is more durable but still needs proper treatment. Knowing how to clean these sections protects your shoes.

For suede areas, always use a specialized suede brush first. Gently brush the dry suede in one direction to remove loose dirt and restore the nap. If you have stains, use a dedicated suede cleaner. Apply a small amount of cleaner to a clean cloth or sponge. Lightly dab the stained area. Do not rub vigorously, as this can spread the stain or damage the suede. For detailed steps on cleaning suede, refer to our guide: [How To Clean New Balance Suede Shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-new-balance-suede-shoes).

For leather accents, a mild soap solution like the one used for mesh works well. Dip a clean cloth into the soapy water. Wring it out so it is only damp, not wet. Gently wipe the leather surfaces. Follow up with a dry cloth to remove any excess moisture. Leather needs to be moisturized to prevent cracking. After cleaning, consider applying a leather conditioner. Treat these materials with care to maintain their texture and color.

## Cleaning the Midsole and Outsole of Your New Balance 327

The midsole and outsole of your New Balance 327 take the most abuse. They collect dirt, mud, and scuff marks easily. Cleaning these parts is crucial for the overall appearance of your shoes. A clean sole makes a big difference to how fresh your sneakers look.

For the midsole, which is often white or light-colored, use a mild soap solution and a stiff brush or an old toothbrush. Scrub the rubber or foam midsole firmly. Pay attention to any scuff marks or embedded dirt. If your 327s have white midsoles, you might find specific white shoe cleaners helpful. You can learn more about keeping white shoes bright here: [How To Clean White New Balance Shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-white-new-balance-shoes). After scrubbing, wipe the midsole clean with a damp cloth. Make sure all soap residue is gone.

The outsole, the bottom part of your shoe, usually has deep treads. These treads trap a lot of dirt and small stones. Use the stiff brush or toothbrush to dig into these grooves. You can rinse the outsole under running water to help dislodge stubborn debris. Just be careful not to get the upper excessively wet. Once clean, wipe the outsole dry with a cloth. A clean sole not only looks better but also helps maintain grip.

## Drying Your New Balance 327 Shoes Safely

Drying your New Balance 327 shoes correctly is just as important as cleaning them. Incorrect drying methods can cause damage. High heat can shrink or warp materials like suede and mesh. It can also weaken adhesives. Always choose a safe, gentle drying process.

After cleaning, gently pat your shoes with a clean towel to remove excess water. Do not wring or twist them. Next, stuff the inside of each shoe with paper towels or old newspapers. This helps absorb internal moisture and maintain the shoe's shape as it dries. Change the paper every few hours if it becomes very damp.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or heat sources. A cool, dry room is ideal. Avoid using radiators, hairdryers, or direct sun. These can crack leather, shrink mesh, or melt glues. Drying can take 24 to 48 hours, depending on how wet the shoes got. Patience is key here. Make sure your New Balance 327s are completely dry before you wear them again. Wearing damp shoes can lead to bad odors and mildew growth.

## Post-Cleaning Care and Protection for Your 327s

Cleaning your New Balance 327 shoes is a great first step. But proper post-cleaning care extends their cleanliness and lifespan. A little extra effort after drying can make a big difference. This section focuses on protecting your shoes after they are clean.

Once your shoes are completely dry, consider applying a shoe protector spray. These sprays create a barrier against water and stains. They are especially useful for suede and mesh parts. Make sure the spray is suitable for all materials on your 327s. Apply it evenly according to the product instructions. This protective layer helps prevent dirt from sticking in the future.

Store your New Balance 327s properly when not in use. Keep them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Shoe trees can help maintain their shape and absorb moisture. If odors become an issue, use shoe deodorizers or natural alternatives like baking soda sachets. Regular spot cleaning between deep washes will also help keep your 327s looking fresh. Good care habits mean less frequent deep cleaning.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning New Balance 327

Cleaning your New Balance 327 shoes is straightforward, but some common errors can cause damage. Avoiding these mistakes will help keep your shoes looking new for longer. Knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do.

First, never put your New Balance 327s in a washing machine. The harsh agitation and high temperatures can damage the materials, adhesives, and shape of the shoe. This applies especially to models with suede or delicate mesh. Second, do not use harsh chemicals. Bleach, strong detergents, or abrasive cleaners can discolor or degrade the shoe materials. Always opt for mild soaps or specialized shoe cleaners.

Third, avoid drying your shoes with direct heat. As mentioned before, heat sources like dryers or radiators can shrink, crack, or warp the shoe. Always air dry them naturally. Fourth, do not neglect the insoles and laces. They also need cleaning. Leaving them dirty can reintroduce grime and odors to your freshly cleaned shoes. Finally, do not scrub suede too hard or use water on it excessively. Suede is very sensitive to moisture and abrasion. Gentle care is essential for this material.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Cleaning New Balance 327

### Can I machine wash my New Balance 327 shoes?

No, you should not machine wash New Balance 327 shoes. The washing machine's agitation and heat can damage the various materials like suede, mesh, and the shoe's adhesives. It can also cause the shoes to lose their original shape. Hand cleaning is always the safest and most effective method for these sneakers.

### How often should I clean my New Balance 327s?

The cleaning frequency depends on how often you wear them and where. For regular use, a light brush-off after each wear helps. A more thorough cleaning every few weeks or months is good. Clean them immediately if they get muddy or stained. Regular maintenance prevents deep stains from setting in.

### What cleaning products are safe for New Balance 327s?

Mild dish soap mixed with water is safe for mesh, nylon, and rubber parts. For suede, use a specialized suede cleaner and brush. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach or strong detergents. Always test any new cleaning product on a small, hidden area first to check for discoloration.

### How do I remove tough stains from New Balance 327 suede?

For tough suede stains, first try a suede eraser or a specialized suede brush. If the stain remains, use a small amount of dedicated suede cleaner. Apply it gently with a clean cloth or sponge, blotting the stain rather than rubbing. Let it dry, then re-brush the nap.

### Can I use a magic eraser on my 327s?

You can use a magic eraser, or melamine foam, on the rubber midsoles and outsoles of your New Balance 327s. It is effective for removing scuff marks and dirt from these surfaces. However, avoid using it on delicate materials like mesh, nylon, or especially suede, as it can damage or discolor them.

### What causes yellowing on white New Balance 327 midsoles?

Yellowing on white midsoles often happens due to oxidation from sun exposure and contact with dirt or chemicals. Over time, the rubber material reacts with oxygen and UV light. Regular cleaning helps reduce buildup, but some yellowing can be a natural aging process. Keeping them out of direct sunlight can slow this down.

## Conclusion

Keeping your New Balance 327 shoes clean ensures they last longer and maintain their stylish look. We have covered every step from gathering your tools to drying your shoes safely. Remember to always treat different materials like mesh, suede, and rubber with specific care. Gentle methods are often the most effective.
