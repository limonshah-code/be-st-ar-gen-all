Understanding why the Diablos left helps explain the gap before the Chihuahuas arrived. It highlights the shifting landscape of minor league baseball. It also explains the need for a modern facility.

The primary reason for the Diablos' departure was the **need for a new stadium**. Cohen Stadium, built in 1990, was considered state-of-the-art at the time. However, by the early 2000s, minor league baseball standards had changed. New stadiums across the country featured more amenities. They offered better clubhouses, modern suites, and enhanced fan experiences. These new standards became crucial for profitability. Many teams faced mandates to upgrade their facilities.
