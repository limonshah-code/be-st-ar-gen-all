### The direct method to clean your P20ee Ford 6.7 Diesel system involves a multi-step approach focusing on the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) components. This includes cleaning the Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) injector, lines, and tank, performing a DPF regeneration if needed, and inspecting or cleaning the SCR catalyst for buildup to resolve the P20ee fault code.

## Understanding the P20ee Code and Your Ford 6.7 Diesel

Your Ford 6.7 Diesel truck uses a complex emissions system. The P20ee code signals a problem within this system. Specifically, it points to an issue with the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system. This system reduces harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) from your exhaust. It works by injecting Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) into the exhaust stream. This fluid reacts with the NOx in the SCR catalyst. The result is harmless nitrogen and water vapor.

The P20ee code means the NOx sensor sees an issue with the SCR system's efficiency. The system is not converting NOx as it should. This often happens due to contamination or buildup. Carbon deposits can form, or DEF can crystalize. These blockages prevent the system from working correctly. Your truck's computer detects this inefficiency. It then triggers the P20ee fault code. You might notice reduced engine power or a warning message on your dash. Addressing this issue quickly prevents further damage. It also keeps your truck running efficiently. Understanding this code helps you pinpoint the cleaning needs for your Ford 6.7 Diesel.

The Ford 6.7 Diesel engine is a powerhouse, but its emissions system requires precise function. The SCR system is a critical part of this. When it malfunctions, the P20ee code appears. This code essentially says, "I'm not cleaning the exhaust enough." The P20ee code indicates the SCR catalyst efficiency is below a certain threshold. This threshold is set by the manufacturer. Several factors can cause this drop in efficiency. It could be a bad sensor, a clogged DEF injector, or a poisoned catalyst. We will explore each of these possibilities.

It is important to understand the components involved. The DEF tank holds the fluid. A DEF pump pushes the fluid through lines to an injector. This injector sprays DEF into the exhaust. The exhaust then flows into the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). After the DPF, it enters the SCR catalyst. NOx sensors monitor the exhaust gas before and after the SCR catalyst. The P20ee code usually means the post-catalyst NOx sensor is reading too high. This tells the truck that the SCR catalyst is not doing its job. This problem makes it necessary to know how to clean your Ford 6.7 Diesel system.

## Identifying the Source of P20ee: Common Causes

When your Ford 6.7 Diesel displays the P20ee code, several issues could be at play. Identifying the exact cause saves you time and effort. Most P20ee problems stem from the DEF system or the SCR catalyst itself. Understanding these common culprits helps guide your cleaning efforts. Do not guess what the problem is. Take your time to diagnose it.

One common cause is a clogged or faulty DEF injector. Over time, DEF can crystallize, especially if the engine is frequently shut down before it cools properly. These crystals can block the injector nozzle. This prevents proper DEF spray into the exhaust. An improper spray pattern means the SCR catalyst does not get enough DEF. Therefore, it cannot reduce NOx effectively. A clogged injector is a frequent reason for the P20ee code. This requires specific cleaning steps.

Another significant issue is a contaminated or failed SCR catalyst. The catalyst itself can become poisoned by certain chemicals. These can come from engine oil or fuel additives. This poisoning reduces the catalyst's ability to convert NOx. Sometimes, the catalyst simply wears out. More often, it is a buildup of soot or unburnt DEF crystals. This buildup blocks the catalyst's passages. If the catalyst is restricted, exhaust flow is affected. Its ability to perform chemical reactions also drops. This directly leads to the P20ee code on your Ford 6.7 Diesel.

Furthermore, issues with NOx sensors can trigger a false P20ee code. There are two NOx sensors: one before and one after the SCR catalyst. If either sensor fails, it might send incorrect readings to the engine control module (ECM). The ECM might then incorrectly determine the SCR system is inefficient. This triggers the P20ee code. Before performing extensive cleaning, verify sensor operation. You can do this with a diagnostic scanner. Low-quality DEF or DEF contamination also causes problems. Poor DEF can lead to excessive crystallization or catalyst damage. Always use DEF that meets the ISO 22241 standard.

## Initial Diagnostics and Pre-Cleaning Steps for Your Ford Diesel

Before you begin cleaning any components, proper diagnosis is essential. This step ensures you address the actual problem. It prevents unnecessary work. Start by connecting an OBD-II scanner to your Ford 6.7 Diesel. Check for other related codes. Sometimes, a P20ee code is a symptom of another underlying issue. For instance, a P20B9 (DEF Heater Circuit) might suggest DEF crystallization. This happens because the DEF fluid is not staying warm enough.

After checking codes, examine your DEF tank and fluid. Check the DEF level. Make sure it is full. Also, check the DEF for contamination. It should be clear and colorless. If it looks cloudy, discolored, or has sediment, drain and refill the tank. Contaminated DEF can cause many problems. It can damage the DEF pump and injector. It can also harm the SCR catalyst. Using a clean fluid is critical for proper system function. This helps you get ready to clean your Ford 6.7 Diesel.

Next, visually inspect the DEF lines and injector for leaks or damage. Look for any white, crusty buildup around connections or the injector nozzle. This is crystallized DEF. Such buildup indicates a leak or improper DEF spraying. If you see significant crystallization, you will need to scrape it off carefully. You can use a stiff brush and warm water. Be gentle around the injector. Do not force anything. These initial checks help you focus your cleaning efforts.

Consider performing a forced Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) regeneration. Sometimes, a P20ee code appears if the DPF is excessively loaded with soot. While not directly an SCR issue, DPF problems can impact the overall emissions system performance. A DPF regeneration cycle burns off accumulated soot. Most modern diagnostic tools can initiate this process. Follow your scanner's instructions. Ensure you perform this in a safe area. The exhaust will get very hot during regeneration. A successful regeneration might clear the P20ee code. It can also improve exhaust flow for the SCR system.

## Cleaning the Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Components

Cleaning the Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) system is a critical step to resolve the P20ee code on your Ford 6.7 Diesel. This system includes the DEF tank, lines, and injector. DEF crystallization often causes blockages in these areas. You must use the correct cleaning methods. Do not use harsh chemicals. They can damage the system.

First, focus on the DEF injector. This component sprays DEF into the exhaust. It is prone to crystallization because of heat. Remove the DEF injector from its mounting. You will likely find white, crusty DEF buildup around the nozzle. Carefully scrape off the large pieces. Then, soak the injector nozzle in hot water. Distilled water is best. This helps dissolve the remaining DEF crystals. You can use a soft brush or pipe cleaner to gently scrub the nozzle. Ensure all holes are clear. Do not use metal tools that can scratch the nozzle. A damaged nozzle will spray incorrectly.

*   **Steps to Clean DEF Injector:**
    1.  Locate and safely remove the DEF injector.
    2.  Carefully scrape off visible DEF crystal buildup from the nozzle.
    3.  Soak the nozzle in a container of hot distilled water for 15-30 minutes.
    4.  Use a soft brush (like a toothbrush) or a small pipe cleaner to gently clear any remaining blockages in the nozzle holes.
    5.  Rinse thoroughly with clean water and let it air dry completely before reinstallation.

Next, address the DEF lines. Crystallization can occur inside the lines, restricting fluid flow. If you suspect blockages, you might need to remove and flush the lines. Use compressed air to blow out any loose debris. Then, flush them with hot distilled water. Ensure all water drains out completely before reattaching them. Any remaining water can freeze or dilute the DEF. This can cause more problems. For more general cleaning advice, sometimes knowing [how to clean everything](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-everything) can inspire solutions for specific parts.

The DEF tank itself might need cleaning, especially if you had contaminated DEF. Drain the tank completely. Rinse it out multiple times with distilled water. Ensure no sediment or foreign material remains. Some technicians use a DEF system cleaner additive that you add to the DEF tank. These additives claim to prevent crystallization and clean the system. Follow the product's instructions carefully. After cleaning, refill the tank with fresh, high-quality DEF that meets ISO 22241 standards. This helps prevent future P20ee codes and ensures your Ford 6.7 Diesel runs efficiently.

## Addressing the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) for P20ee

While the P20ee code primarily points to the SCR system, a problematic Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) can indirectly contribute. The DPF captures soot from the exhaust. If it becomes excessively clogged, it can impede exhaust flow. This can affect the efficiency of the downstream SCR system. Therefore, assessing and potentially cleaning your DPF is a logical step when troubleshooting the P20ee code on your Ford 6.7 Diesel.

The most common way to address a clogged DPF is through regeneration. Your Ford 6.7 Diesel usually performs passive regeneration during highway driving. This burns off soot at high temperatures. If driving conditions do not allow this, the truck initiates active regeneration. This injects fuel into the exhaust to raise temperatures. If regeneration fails, soot builds up. You might then need to perform a forced regeneration using a diagnostic scan tool. This procedure forces the truck to run a high-temperature cycle. It aims to burn off the accumulated soot. Ensure you follow all safety guidelines. The exhaust temperatures during regeneration are extremely high.

*   **DPF Regeneration Steps (using a diagnostic tool):**
    1.  Connect a compatible diagnostic scan tool to your Ford 6.7 Diesel.
    2.  Navigate to the DPF regeneration function in the tool's menu.
    3.  Follow the on-screen prompts. Ensure the vehicle is in a well-ventilated area.
    4.  Monitor the process. The engine RPM will increase, and exhaust temperatures will rise.
    5.  Allow the regeneration cycle to complete fully. Do not interrupt it.

If forced regeneration does not resolve the issue, the DPF may be too heavily loaded. It might also have ash buildup. Ash does not burn off during regeneration. It accumulates over the DPF's lifespan. In such cases, professional DPF cleaning might be necessary. This involves specialized equipment. Shops use a chemical bath or baking process to remove soot and ash. Alternatively, the DPF might need replacement. Replacement is usually a last resort due to cost.

A DPF issue can indirectly affect the SCR system. An overly clogged DPF can create back pressure. It can also reduce exhaust gas temperature. Both factors can hinder the SCR catalyst's performance. By ensuring your DPF is clean and functioning, you provide the optimal environment for your SCR system. This helps avoid the P20ee code from recurring. Maintaining a clean DPF is part of overall emission system health for your Ford 6.7 Diesel.

## Cleaning the SCR Catalyst and Related Sensors

The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst is the heart of your Ford 6.7 Diesel's NOx reduction system. If the P20ee code persists after addressing the DEF system and DPF, the SCR catalyst itself is likely the problem. Contamination or buildup within the catalyst's honeycomb structure reduces its efficiency. Cleaning this component requires careful handling.

The SCR catalyst can get clogged with DEF crystals or soot. It can also become "poisoned" by substances like silicone from coolants or oil additives. If poisoned, cleaning may not restore its function. However, if it's just clogged with DEF or soot, cleaning is a viable option. For light blockages, a forced regeneration might help. This is similar to DPF regeneration. The high heat can burn off some deposits. Your diagnostic scanner might have an SCR "bake-out" or "cleanse" function.

For more stubborn blockages, physical cleaning might be needed. This usually requires removing the SCR catalyst from the vehicle. Once removed, you can attempt to clean it. Some technicians use a pressure washer with warm water. Spray water through the catalyst in the reverse direction of exhaust flow. This helps push out accumulated material. You must use only water. Do not use chemicals or detergents. They can damage the catalyst's precious metal coatings. Ensure the catalyst is completely dry before reinstalling. Any remaining moisture can cause issues. This kind of specialized cleaning effort differs greatly from [how to clean a gas can](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-gas-can), but both share the principle of removing contaminants.

*   **Steps to Clean SCR Catalyst (if removed):**
    1.  Safely remove the SCR catalyst from the vehicle's exhaust system.
    2.  Inspect the catalyst for severe damage or signs of poisoning.
    3.  Using a pressure washer, spray warm water through the catalyst. Spray in the opposite direction of normal exhaust flow.
    4.  Continue spraying until water runs clear from the catalyst.
    5.  Allow the catalyst to completely air dry. You can use compressed air to speed up the process. Ensure it is bone dry.

Additionally, inspect and clean the NOx sensors. These sensors are crucial for the ECM to monitor SCR efficiency. There is one before and one after the SCR catalyst. They can become coated with soot or DEF residue. Carefully remove the sensors. Use a soft brush to gently clean the sensor tip. Do not use abrasive materials. Some automotive cleaning sprays are designed for oxygen or NOx sensors. Spray cleaners for sensors can help dissolve buildup. If a sensor is faulty, cleaning will not fix it. It will need replacement. Replacing a faulty NOx sensor often resolves the P20ee code if the catalyst is actually fine. Verifying sensor function after cleaning is important. This ensures your Ford 6.7 Diesel's SCR system can report correctly.

## Post-Cleaning Procedures and Preventing Future P20ee Codes

After performing cleaning procedures on your Ford 6.7 Diesel's DEF system, DPF, and SCR catalyst, several important steps remain. These steps confirm your efforts were successful. They also help prevent the P20ee code from returning. Do not skip these final actions. They are crucial for long-term system health.

First, reinstall all components carefully. Ensure all connections are secure. Check for any leaks in the DEF lines or exhaust system. Leaks can cause further issues. Torque bolts to factory specifications. This prevents exhaust leaks or damage. Once everything is reassembled, refill the DEF tank with fresh, high-quality DEF. Use a brand that meets or exceeds the ISO 22241 standard. Quality DEF is essential.

After reassembly, clear the P20ee fault code from your truck's engine control module (ECM). Use your diagnostic scan tool for this. Clearing the code resets the system. Then, perform a drive cycle. A drive cycle allows the ECM to re-evaluate the SCR system's performance. Drive at varying speeds, including some highway driving. This helps the system run diagnostic monitors. If the P20ee code does not reappear after the drive cycle, your cleaning efforts were likely successful. This process ensures your Ford 6.7 Diesel is operating properly.

*   **Post-Cleaning Checklist:**
    1.  Reinstall all cleaned components, ensuring secure connections.
    2.  Refill DEF tank with fresh, high-quality ISO 22241 compliant DEF.
    3.  Clear the P20ee fault code using a diagnostic scan tool.
    4.  Perform a comprehensive drive cycle to allow system monitors to reset.
    5.  Monitor the dashboard for any returning check engine lights or warning messages.

To prevent future P20ee codes, adopt good maintenance habits. Always use high-quality DEF. Avoid buying DEF from questionable sources. Cheap DEF might not meet standards. It can contain impurities. These impurities cause crystallization and catalyst poisoning. Store DEF properly in a cool, dry place. Avoid letting it freeze or get too hot. Extreme temperatures degrade DEF.

Regular highway driving helps keep the DPF and SCR systems clean. Longer drives allow passive regeneration to occur. Short, stop-and-go driving often leads to soot and crystal buildup. If your truck mainly does short trips, consider an occasional extended highway drive. This helps burn off accumulated deposits. Also, consider adding a DEF system cleaner product to your DEF tank every few oil changes. These additives help prevent crystallization. They keep the DEF system clean. Following these steps helps maintain your Ford 6.7 Diesel's emissions system. It also ensures trouble-free operation.
