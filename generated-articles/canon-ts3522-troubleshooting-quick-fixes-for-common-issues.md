Is your Canon TS3522 producing prints that look off? Print quality issues are frustrating. They can ruin documents and photos. These problems usually involve your ink cartridges or the printhead. You want clear, vibrant prints every time. Addressing these issues helps maintain good output.

#### Streaky or Faded Prints

Streaks or faded areas on your prints often mean low ink. Check your Canon TS3522's ink levels. Replace any cartridges that are nearly empty. Sometimes, the issue is not low ink but clogged printhead nozzles. Ink dries on the nozzles, blocking ink flow. Your printer has a built-in cleaning function.

Perform a printhead cleaning cycle. Access this through your printer's utility software on your computer or the printer's control panel. Run the cleaning cycle two or three times if needed. After cleaning, print a nozzle check pattern. This pattern shows if all nozzles are firing correctly. If streaks persist, a deep cleaning cycle may be necessary. For detailed steps on cleaning, see [How to Clean Printer Head Canon](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-printer-head-canon).

*   **Check Ink Levels:** Verify ink levels and replace low cartridges.
*   **Run Printhead Cleaning:** Use the printer utility to perform a standard printhead cleaning cycle.
*   **Nozzle Check:** Print a nozzle check pattern to assess printhead performance.
*   **Deep Cleaning:** If streaks remain, try a deep cleaning cycle.

#### Blurry Text or Images

Blurry prints mean your printer is not placing ink precisely. This can be a printhead alignment issue. The printhead might be slightly out of position. This makes text look fuzzy or images appear indistinct. Your Canon TS3522 has an alignment function. This function adjusts the printhead's position.

Run the printhead alignment utility. This is usually found in your printer's software or on its control panel. The printer will print a test pattern. It then asks you to select the best-aligned pattern. Follow the on-screen instructions carefully. Sometimes, using non-genuine ink cartridges can also affect print quality. These cartridges may not deliver ink as consistently. Using genuine Canon ink is often best for optimal results. You can find more information about printhead maintenance here: [How to Clean the Printhead on a Canon Printer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-printhead-on-a-canon-printer).

*   **Printhead Alignment:** Run the printhead alignment utility from your printer’s software or panel.
*   **Follow Prompts:** Carefully follow the instructions to select the best alignment pattern.
*   **Check Ink Cartridges:** Ensure you use genuine ink cartridges for best print quality.
*   **Paper Type:** Verify you are using the correct paper type for your print settings.

### Paper Jam Predicaments: Clearing Obstructions in Your TS3522

Has your Canon TS3522 stopped mid-print with a paper jam error? Paper jams are common. They can stop your printing process dead. Paper can get stuck for various reasons, including incorrect loading or tiny debris. You must remove the jammed paper carefully. Forcing it out can cause damage.

#### Frequent Paper Jams

If your Canon TS3522 jams often, check the paper you use. Ensure it is compatible with your printer. Use fresh, dry paper. Old or damp paper can stick together. Fan the paper stack before loading it. This separates the sheets and reduces static. Load the paper correctly into the tray. Do not overload it. Overloading the tray can cause misfeeds.

Inspect the paper path for small foreign objects. Tiny bits of paper or dust can cause jams. Look inside the printer where the paper travels. Remove any visible obstructions gently. Avoid tearing the paper if possible. Torn paper bits can remain inside and cause future jams. Always pull jammed paper slowly and in the direction of the paper path.

*   **Paper Quality:** Use fresh, dry, and compatible paper.
*   **Paper Loading:** Fan paper before loading and do not overload the tray.
*   **Inspect Paper Path:** Look for and carefully remove any debris or torn paper bits inside the printer.
*   **Gentle Removal:** Pull jammed paper slowly in the direction of the paper's travel.

#### Paper Not Feeding

Sometimes, the paper does not feed into the printer at all. This might also indicate a jam, but it could be an issue with the rollers. The rollers pull the paper into the printer. If they are dirty or worn, they cannot grip the paper. Try cleaning the paper rollers. Use a damp, lint-free cloth to wipe the rollers. Power off your printer first.

Ensure the paper guides in the tray are snug against the paper stack. Loose guides can cause the paper to skew. Skewed paper might not enter the printer correctly. After cleaning rollers and adjusting guides, try printing again. If the problem persists, the rollers might be too worn. In this case, professional service might be needed. For a general guide on cleaning various items, including electronics, always refer to your device manual.

*   **Roller Cleaning:** Wipe paper rollers with a damp, lint-free cloth after turning off the printer.
*   **Adjust Paper Guides:** Make sure paper guides are fitted snugly against the paper stack in the tray.
*   **Paper Type:** Double-check that the paper type selected in your print settings matches the paper loaded.
*   **Test Print:** After adjustments, try printing a test page to confirm the fix.

### Ink System Struggles: Resolving Cartridge and Ink Level Warnings

Your Canon TS3522 relies on a functioning ink system. Problems with ink cartridges or persistent low ink warnings can stop printing. You need to ensure the printer recognizes your cartridges. Proper ink flow is essential for good print results. These issues are often simple to fix.

#### Ink Cartridge Not Recognized

When your Canon TS3522 says a cartridge is not recognized, it is frustrating. First, remove the cartridge in question. Reinsert it firmly. Make sure it clicks into place. Sometimes, the electrical contacts on the cartridge or in the printer get dirty. Use a dry, lint-free cloth to gently wipe the gold contacts on the cartridge. Do not touch the print nozzles.

If the problem persists, try a new cartridge. Sometimes, a cartridge is faulty from the factory. Ensure you are using genuine Canon ink cartridges. Third-party cartridges can sometimes cause recognition issues. These issues might stem from design differences or chip compatibility. Using genuine cartridges often prevents these problems. For further details on cleaning printheads, which relates to ink flow, refer to [How to Clean Printer Head Canon](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-printer-head-canon).

*   **Reinsert Cartridge:** Remove and firmly reinsert the ink cartridge until it clicks.
*   **Clean Contacts:** Gently wipe the gold electrical contacts on the cartridge with a dry, lint-free cloth.
*   **Try New Cartridge:** Replace the cartridge with a brand-new, genuine Canon cartridge.
*   **Genuine Ink:** Ensure you use genuine Canon ink to avoid compatibility issues.

#### Low Ink Warnings Persist

You might replace an ink cartridge, but the low ink warning does not disappear. This can happen for a few reasons. The printer’s internal ink counter might not reset immediately. Try resetting the printer. Turn it off, unplug it, wait a few minutes, then plug it back in and turn it on. This can refresh the system.

Some printers require you to acknowledge the new cartridge. Look for a prompt on the printer’s display. You might need to press a button to confirm the replacement. If you are using refilled or third-party cartridges, the printer might intentionally show persistent warnings. This is often a way for manufacturers to encourage the use of their own products. As long as prints are clear, you may choose to ignore these warnings for third-party inks. However, for best performance and accuracy, genuine ink is recommended.
