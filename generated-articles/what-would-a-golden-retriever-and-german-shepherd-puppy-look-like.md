## Discovering the Golden Retriever and German Shepherd Puppy Look

Have you ever imagined combining the loyal nature of a German Shepherd with the friendly spirit of a Golden Retriever? When these two beloved breeds come together, they create a truly special mixed breed, often called a Golden Shepherd or German Retriever. People often wonder, **what would a Golden Retriever and German Shepherd puppy look like**? I find this question incredibly intriguing because each puppy is a unique genetic lottery. This article will explore the fascinating blend of physical traits inherited by these charming puppies. We will delve into their potential appearance, covering everything from coat colors and textures to their size, build, and distinctive facial features. Understanding these aspects helps future owners know what to expect from their adorable Golden Shepherd puppy.

### Takeaway

*   **Appearance Varies Greatly:** Golden Shepherd puppies inherit traits from both parents; no two look exactly alike.
*   **Coat Diversity:** Expect colors from light cream to deep black, with medium to long, dense fur.
*   **Size and Build:** Puppies grow into medium-to-large dogs, balancing the Golden Retriever's sturdy frame with the German Shepherd's athletic build.
*   **Facial Features:** Ears can be floppy like a Golden's or erect like a German Shepherd's, or somewhere in between. Eye color is typically brown.
*   **Temperament Mix:** Appearance hints at heritage, but temperament is also a blend, requiring early socialization.

A Golden Retriever and German Shepherd puppy will display a diverse blend of physical traits from both parent breeds. Their appearance can vary widely in terms of coat color, texture, ear set, body build, and facial features. Each puppy is a unique combination, reflecting the dominant genes inherited from either the Golden Retriever or the German Shepherd. This genetic mix creates puppies with highly individual and often charming looks.

## Understanding the Golden Retriever German Shepherd Mix

The Golden Retriever German Shepherd mix is a fascinating hybrid dog. This crossbreed combines two of the most popular and respected dog breeds worldwide. The resulting puppies often inherit the best traits from both sides. We call this mix by several names, including the Golden Shepherd or the German Retriever.

Both parent breeds bring strong genetic characteristics to the table. Golden Retrievers are known for their friendly demeanor, beautiful golden coats, and sturdy build. German Shepherds are famous for their intelligence, loyalty, and distinctive black and tan coats. The goal of this mix is often to combine the Golden's gentle nature with the Shepherd's protective instincts and intelligence. I find that this blend creates a dog with both beauty and brains.

Predicting the exact appearance of a Golden Shepherd puppy is challenging. Genetics play a significant role in how traits are passed down. Each puppy in a litter can look different, even from the same parents. Some puppies might lean more towards the Golden Retriever in appearance, while others might strongly resemble the German Shepherd. This genetic variability makes each Golden Shepherd puppy a unique surprise. Owners often enjoy watching their puppy develop its distinct look.

### The Appeal of Hybrid Dogs

Hybrid dogs, like the Golden Shepherd, offer a unique appeal. They combine specific traits from two purebred parents. This mixing of genes can sometimes lead to a healthier dog, a concept known as hybrid vigor. Hybrid vigor suggests that crossbreeds may have a broader genetic pool, potentially reducing the incidence of certain breed-specific health issues. However, it is not a guarantee.

People choose mixed breeds for various reasons. They might be looking for a specific combination of temperament traits. They could also be drawn to the unique appearance a hybrid dog offers. The Golden Shepherd, in particular, draws people in with the promise of a loving, intelligent, and protective companion. I believe this blend of qualities is what makes them so desirable.

When considering a Golden Shepherd puppy, research both parent breeds thoroughly. Understand their needs, potential health issues, and typical behaviors. This preparation ensures you are ready for the responsibilities of owning such a dynamic dog. Learning about the Golden Retriever's needs can be a good start: [How Hard Is It To Take Care Of A Golden Retriever Puppy](https://beacleaner.com/how-hard-is-it-to-take-care-of-a-golden-retriever-puppy).

## Predicting Puppy Appearance: A Genetic Blueprint

Predicting the exact appearance of a Golden Retriever German Shepherd puppy is like unwrapping a surprise gift. Each puppy inherits a unique combination of genes from its parents. These genes determine everything from coat color and texture to ear shape and body build. There is no single "look" for a Golden Shepherd; variability is a defining characteristic.

Genetic dominance and recessiveness play a significant role. For instance, the Golden Retriever's floppy ears are typically recessive, while the German Shepherd's erect ears can be dominant. This means a puppy might have floppy ears, erect ears, or even ears that are somewhere in between, perhaps starting floppy and later standing up. Coat type and color also follow these genetic rules. I find it fascinating how genes can create such diverse outcomes even within the same litter.

### Understanding Parent Genetics

To better predict a Golden Shepherd puppy's appearance, consider the specific traits of the parent dogs. Were they both long-haired, or was one short-haired? What were their exact coat colors? For example, Golden Retrievers come in various shades of gold, from cream to dark red. German Shepherds typically sport black and tan, but can also be solid black, sable, or even white. The combination of these colors determines the puppy's potential palette. You can learn more about Golden Retriever color variations here: [What is the difference between a Golden Retriever and a Red Golden Retriever](https://beacleaner.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-golden-retriever-and-a-red-golden-retriever).

Here are some factors influencing a Golden Shepherd puppy's look:

*   **Dominant vs. Recessive Genes:** Some traits are more likely to appear if one parent carries the dominant gene.
*   **Polygenic Traits:** Many traits, like size and overall build, are influenced by multiple genes. This makes precise prediction difficult.
*   **Parental Appearance:** While not a guarantee, puppies often resemble their parents or grandparents. Observing the specific looks of the sire and dam gives clues.
*   **Litter Variability:** Even littermates can look quite different from each other. This is due to the random shuffling of genes during reproduction.

I always advise prospective owners to see the parents if possible. Observing the parents helps visualize the potential range of traits in the puppies. However, remember that nature loves surprises. Every Golden Shepherd puppy is a one-of-a-kind creation.

## Coat Colors and Textures: The Golden Shepherd Palette

The coat of a Golden Retriever and German Shepherd puppy is one of its most variable and striking features. This mixed breed can inherit a wide range of colors and textures from its diverse gene pool. You might see a puppy with the golden hues of a Retriever, the classic black and tan of a Shepherd, or a unique blend of both. I find this aspect particularly exciting, as it means each Golden Shepherd puppy truly has its own signature look.

### Potential Coat Colors

The possible coat colors for a Golden Shepherd puppy are quite extensive. Here are some of the most common possibilities:

*   **Golden Shades:** Puppies can inherit the full spectrum of Golden Retriever colors. This includes light cream, various shades of gold, and even darker reddish-gold tones. These puppies often have a softer, more classic Golden Retriever appearance.
*   **Black and Tan:** The iconic German Shepherd black and tan pattern is a strong possibility. Puppies with this coloring will have a darker saddle or back, with tan markings on their legs, chest, and face.
*   **Solid Black:** Some Golden Shepherds can be entirely black. This color can come from the German Shepherd side, as black is a recognized color in the breed. It can also appear if the Golden Retriever parent carries recessive genes for darker pigment.
*   **Sable:** This is another common German Shepherd color. Sable coats feature individual hairs that are banded with different colors, creating a rich, textured appearance.
*   **Bi-color:** This refers to dogs with two distinct colors, like black with tan points, similar to the black and tan but with more clearly defined boundaries.
*   **Rare Colors:** While less common, depending on the parentage, possibilities like liver or blue (diluted black) could theoretically occur if those genes are present in the lineage, though they are not standard for either purebred.

The exact shade and distribution of color will vary significantly. It is common for puppies to have a mix of colors, perhaps a golden base with darker German Shepherd-like markings.

### Coat Texture and Length

Beyond color, the texture and length of a Golden Shepherd's coat also vary. Both Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds have double coats, meaning their puppies will too. A double coat provides insulation against both cold and heat.

*   **Length:** Puppies can have medium-length coats, typical of most Goldens, or slightly longer, denser coats, often seen in German Shepherds. Some puppies might even develop the longer, flowing coat seen in long-haired German Shepherds. You can learn how to identify long-haired German Shepherd puppies here: [How Can You Tell If A German Shepherd Puppy Is Long-Haired](https://beacleaner.com/how-can-you-tell-if-a-german-shepherd-puppy-is-long-haired).
*   **Texture:** The texture can range from the smooth, water-repellent outer coat of a Golden Retriever to the coarser, slightly harsher outer coat of a German Shepherd. The undercoat will always be soft and dense.
*   **Feathering:** Many Golden Shepherd puppies will exhibit feathering, particularly on their legs, tail, and underside, a trait characteristic of Golden Retrievers. This adds to their elegant appearance.

Regardless of the specific coat, regular grooming will be essential. Both parent breeds are known for shedding. I always tell new owners to be prepared for regular brushing to manage the shedding and keep the coat healthy and beautiful.

## Size, Build, and Proportions of the Mixed Puppy

When you consider a Golden Retriever and German Shepherd puppy, you are looking at a future medium-to-large-sized dog. Both parent breeds are substantial animals, and their offspring will reflect this. Predicting the exact adult size of a puppy can be tricky, but we can make informed estimates based on the parents.

### Adult Size Expectations

The adult size of a Golden Shepherd typically falls within the range of its parents.

*   **Golden Retrievers:** Males usually weigh 65-75 pounds and stand 23-24 inches tall at the shoulder. Females are slightly smaller, 55-65 pounds and 21.5-22.5 inches tall.
*   **German Shepherds:** Males generally weigh 65-90 pounds and stand 24-26 inches tall. Females weigh 50-70 pounds and stand 22-24 inches tall.

Therefore, a Golden Shepherd mix could weigh anywhere from 50 to 90 pounds and stand 21 to 26 inches tall. Males often tend to be larger than females. The puppy's growth rate will be steady, reaching most of its height by 8-12 months and filling out until 18-24 months. Knowing the best age to bring a German Shepherd puppy home can help you prepare for their growth stages: [What is the best age to take a German Shepherd puppy home](https://beacleaner.com/what-is-the-best-age-to-take-a-german-shepherd-puppy-home).

### Body Build and Proportions

The body build of a Golden Shepherd puppy will also be a blend of its parents.

*   **Golden Retriever Build:** Goldens are known for their sturdy, muscular, and well-balanced build. They have a deep chest, strong hindquarters, and a powerful gait.
*   **German Shepherd Build:** German Shepherds are characterized by their strong, agile, and athletic physique. They often have a slightly sloped back (though this varies by line) and a powerful, ground-covering stride.

A Golden Shepherd puppy might inherit the deeper chest and broader head of a Golden Retriever. They could also have the more streamlined, athletic body and slightly longer legs of a German Shepherd. Some puppies might have a perfect blend, exhibiting a sturdy frame with the agility and powerful hindquarters of a Shepherd. I have seen some with a more rectangular body, showing the length of a Shepherd, while others are squarer, like a Golden. Their bone structure will be solid, indicating a strong and capable dog.

### Puppy Growth Milestones

Observing a Golden Shepherd puppy's growth can give clues about its eventual size and proportions.

*   **Early Weeks:** Puppies grow rapidly in the first few months. Their paws might look disproportionately large, often a sign of a large dog to come.
*   **Adolescence:** As they enter adolescence (around 6-12 months), they might appear gangly. Their bodies are still developing, and they might seem a bit awkward as their limbs grow faster than their chests fill out. This is a normal part of growth.
*   **Maturity:** Full physical maturity typically occurs between 18 and 24 months. At this point, their build will be complete, and their proportions will be well-defined.

Feeding a high-quality diet is crucial for healthy development. The best food for a growing German Shepherd puppy, for example, would be similar to what a Golden Shepherd puppy needs: [What is the best food for a German Shepherd puppy 8 months](https://beacleaner.com/what-is-the-best-food-for-a-german-shepherd-puppy-8-months). This ensures proper bone and muscle development, leading to a strong, well-proportioned adult dog. I always emphasize the importance of good nutrition during the puppy stage.

## Facial Features and Expressions: What to Expect

The face of a Golden Retriever German Shepherd puppy is where much of its unique charm lies. The blend of features from two distinct breeds creates a wide array of possibilities. We can see anything from soft, gentle expressions to alert, intelligent gazes. Each puppy’s face tells a story of its genetic heritage.

### Eye Color and Shape

*   **Eye Color:** Both Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds typically have dark brown eyes. Therefore, a Golden Shepherd puppy will almost certainly have brown eyes. Shades can range from a lighter amber-brown to a deep, dark brown.
*   **Eye Shape:** Golden Retrievers tend to have medium-sized, expressive eyes, often described as gentle. German Shepherds have almond-shaped eyes that convey intelligence and alertness. A Golden Shepherd puppy might have eyes that lean towards either shape, or a mix, resulting in an alert yet friendly look. I often notice how their eyes reflect their combined intelligent and amiable nature.

### Ear Set and Size

The ears are perhaps one of the most unpredictable facial features in a Golden Shepherd.

*   **Golden Retriever Ears:** Goldens have medium-sized, triangular ears that hang close to their head, often called "drop ears."
*   **German Shepherd Ears:** Shepherds are famous for their erect, pointed ears that stand up straight. These are often referred to as "prick ears."

A Golden Shepherd puppy can have:

*   **Drop Ears:** Fully floppy, similar to a Golden Retriever.
*   **Prick Ears:** Fully erect, standing straight up, like a German Shepherd.
*   **Semi-Prick or Rose Ears:** These ears might stand partially erect, perhaps flopping over at the tips, or fold slightly. This is a common compromise between the two parent types.
*   **Mismatched Ears:** It's not uncommon for one ear to stand up and the other to remain floppy, especially during the teething phase when cartilage can be affected by calcium shifts. This often corrects itself as they mature, but some might retain the unique look.

I have seen puppies with adorable lop-sided ears, which often adds to their character. The ears usually begin to stand (if they are going to) between 4 and 6 months of age, sometimes later.

### Muzzle and Head Shape

The muzzle and head shape will also be a combination of the parents.

*   **Golden Retriever Head:** Goldens have a broad, slightly rounded skull and a strong, straight muzzle that blends smoothly into the skull. Their stop (the indentation between the eyes) is moderate.
*   **German Shepherd Head:** Shepherds have a more wedge-shaped head, with a strong, fairly long muzzle and a distinct stop.

A Golden Shepherd puppy might inherit the broader skull of the Golden or the more defined stop and longer muzzle of the Shepherd. Their snout length can vary, from a medium length to slightly longer, often robust and well-proportioned to their head. The teeth will be strong, typically meeting in a scissor bite. Their facial expressions will often be a delightful mix – the open, friendly smile of a Golden combined with the attentive, thoughtful gaze of a German Shepherd. This creates a highly engaging and expressive face that is truly unique to the Golden Shepherd.

## Tail and Ear Traits: Defining Characteristics

Beyond the main body and facial structure, a Golden Retriever German Shepherd puppy's tail and ears offer distinct clues about its mixed heritage. These features can be highly variable and contribute significantly to the puppy’s overall appearance. I find these details fascinating, as they often combine in unexpected ways.

### Tail Characteristics

Both Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds have long, expressive tails, but their typical carriage differs.

*   **Golden Retriever Tail:** Golden Retrievers carry their tails in a "feathered" fashion, meaning they have long fur on the underside. Their tail is an extension of the topline, typically carried level with the back or with a slight upward curve, never curled over the back. It is a powerful rudder for swimming and a wonderful communication tool.
*   **German Shepherd Tail:** German Shepherds typically have a bushy tail that is set low and hangs down in a slight curve. When excited, it can raise, but generally, it does not curl over the back. Some lines may have a more pronounced saber-like curve.

A Golden Shepherd puppy's tail can inherit traits from either parent. It might:

*   **Be feathered like a Golden's:** This is common, adding a touch of elegance.
*   **Have a more saber-like curve:** Reflecting the German Shepherd's tail carriage.
*   **Be carried higher or lower:** Depending on the dominant genetic influence.

The thickness and bushiness of the tail will also vary. Regardless of its exact appearance, the tail will be a strong indicator of the puppy's mood and intentions. A wagging Golden Shepherd tail is a pure joy to behold.

### Ear Set Development

As discussed briefly in facial features, the ears are one of the most intriguing aspects of a Golden Shepherd's look. They are often floppy at birth and begin to change as the puppy grows.

*   **Early Puppyhood:** Most Golden Shepherd puppies are born with floppy ears, similar to purebred Golden Retriever puppies.
*   **Development Phase:** Between 4 and 8 months, as the puppy grows and its cartilage hardens, the ears may begin to stand erect. This process can be gradual, with one ear standing before the other. Teething can sometimes affect this process, causing ears to go up and down temporarily.
*   **Adult Appearance:** By maturity, the ears will typically be either fully erect (like a German Shepherd), fully dropped (like a Golden Retriever), or semi-prick (standing partly up with tips folded). I have seen many Golden Shepherds with charming "one up, one down" ears, which sometimes become a permanent quirky feature.

The size of the ears will generally be medium to large, proportionate to the head size. Their mobility and expressiveness will be high, as both parent breeds use their ears to convey emotion and attention. Monitoring the ear development is one of the exciting parts of raising a Golden Shepherd puppy. It adds to the surprise element of what their ultimate look will be.

## Temperament and Training Considerations for Your Golden Shepherd

While this article focuses on the appearance of a Golden Retriever and German Shepherd puppy, understanding their potential temperament is crucial for any prospective owner. Appearance often hints at heritage, but behavior truly defines the dog. A Golden Shepherd puppy is not just a visual blend; it is also a behavioral one, combining traits from two highly intelligent and capable breeds.

### A Blend of Temperaments

*   **Golden Retriever Traits:** Goldens are renowned for their friendly, eager-to-please nature. They are patient, gentle, and highly social, making them excellent family dogs. They thrive on companionship and are generally good with children and other pets. My experience tells me they are often the "social butterfly" of the dog world.
*   **German Shepherd Traits:** German Shepherds are known for their intelligence, loyalty, and protective instincts. They are confident, courageous, and possess a strong work ethic. They can be reserved with strangers but are fiercely devoted to their families. They require mental stimulation and a clear leader.

A Golden Shepherd puppy can inherit any combination of these traits. You might get a dog with the Golden's outgoing friendliness and the Shepherd's protective alertness. Or, you could have a dog that is more reserved but still enjoys family time. Each puppy is an individual. I believe understanding this spectrum is vital.

### Intelligence and Trainability

Both parent breeds are highly intelligent and trainable. This means a Golden Shepherd puppy will likely be quick to learn commands and eager to please its owner. Their intelligence means they excel in various activities, including obedience, agility, and even search and rescue.

*   **Early Training:** Starting training and socialization early is paramount. This breed needs consistent guidance and positive reinforcement. Their intelligence means they can pick up bad habits just as quickly as good ones if left untrained.
*   **Mental Stimulation:** Due to their German Shepherd lineage, these dogs require significant mental stimulation to prevent boredom and destructive behaviors. Puzzle toys, interactive games, and learning new tricks are excellent ways to engage their minds.
*   **Consistency:** I cannot overstate the importance of consistency in training. A firm yet gentle approach works best, establishing clear boundaries and expectations.

### Exercise Needs

Both Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds are active breeds with high energy levels. A Golden Shepherd puppy will grow into an energetic adult requiring substantial daily exercise.

*   **Physical Activity:** Expect to provide at least 60-90 minutes of vigorous exercise daily. This can include brisk walks, running, hiking, playing fetch, or swimming. Their physical stamina is impressive.
*   **Purposeful Activities:** Engaging them in activities with a purpose, such as retrieving games or structured training sessions, will satisfy their drive. A bored Golden Shepherd can become destructive.

Caring for a puppy involves understanding their needs from the very beginning. For example, knowing what to do with a newborn Golden Retriever puppy can give insight into the care required: [How Do You Take Care Of A Newborn Golden Retriever Puppy](https://beacleaner.com/how-do-you-take-care-of-a-newborn-golden-retriever-puppy). This hybrid dog thrives with an active family who can provide ample physical and mental challenges. They are not suited for a sedentary lifestyle or long periods of isolation. I always tell people, if you want a couch potato, this is not the dog for you. If you want an active, intelligent, and loyal companion, the Golden Shepherd might be your perfect match.

## Common Health Considerations for Golden Shepherd Puppies

Understanding the potential health issues of a Golden Retriever and German Shepherd puppy is as important as knowing what they look like. Mixed breeds can inherit health predispositions from both parent lines. While hybrid vigor might offer some protection, it does not make them immune to genetic conditions. Responsible breeding is crucial to minimize these risks.

### Inherited Conditions from Golden Retrievers

Golden Retrievers are generally healthy but are prone to certain genetic conditions.

*   **Hip and Elbow Dysplasia:** This is a common orthopedic condition where the joints do not fit together properly, leading to arthritis and pain. Both parents should have their hips and elbows screened.
*   **Cancer:** Goldens have a higher incidence of certain cancers, particularly lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma.
*   **Eye Conditions:** Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) and cataracts are some eye conditions seen in the breed.
*   **Heart Conditions:** Subvalvular Aortic Stenosis (SAS) is a congenital heart defect that can affect Golden Retrievers.

### Inherited Conditions from German Shepherds

German Shepherds also have their own set of health concerns.

*   **Hip and Elbow Dysplasia:** Similar to Goldens, German Shepherds are also highly susceptible to these joint problems. This increases the likelihood that a Golden Shepherd mix could inherit them.
*   **Degenerative Myelopathy (DM):** A progressive neurological disease affecting the spinal cord, leading to hind limb weakness and paralysis. Responsible breeders screen for this condition.
*   **Bloat (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus - GDV):** A life-threatening condition where the stomach twists. Deep-chested breeds like German Shepherds are at higher risk.
*   **Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI):** A condition where the pancreas does not produce enough digestive enzymes.

### Comprehensive Health Screening

When considering a Golden Shepherd puppy, I strongly advise inquiring about the health clearances of both parent dogs. Reputable breeders will perform health screenings for conditions common to both breeds. These screenings include:

*   **OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) certifications:** For hips and elbows, indicating good joint health.
*   **Eye clearances:** From a veterinary ophthalmologist.
*   **Cardiac clearances:** From a veterinary cardiologist.
*   **DNA tests:** For conditions like Degenerative Myelopathy (DM), which is relevant for German Shepherds.

Puppies from parents with clear health certifications have a significantly lower risk of developing these inherited conditions. This due diligence ensures you bring home a puppy with the best possible start. While you can't guarantee a lifetime of health, proactive steps greatly reduce risks. Investing in a healthy puppy upfront saves considerable heartache and veterinary costs later on.

## Finding a Responsible Golden Shepherd Puppy Breeder

Finding a reputable breeder is paramount when looking for a Golden Retriever and German Shepherd puppy. A responsible breeder prioritizes the health, temperament, and well-being of their dogs above all else. They are not just selling puppies; they are dedicated to the betterment of the breed and ensuring their puppies go to suitable homes. My personal belief is that a good breeder is a partner in your puppy journey.

### Characteristics of a Responsible Breeder

*   **Health Clearances:** This is non-negotiable. A responsible breeder will provide proof of health clearances for both parent dogs. This includes certifications for hips, elbows, eyes, and potentially DNA tests for genetic conditions like DM. They understand [What are the health problems with German Shepherd Golden Retriever mix](https://beacleaner.com/what-are-the-health-problems-with-german-shepherd-golden-retriever-mix) and actively work to prevent them.
*   **Transparency:** They are open about their breeding practices, the health history of their dogs, and any potential issues in the lineage. They will answer all your questions thoroughly and honestly.
*   **See the Parents:** They will allow you to meet both the mother (dam) and often the father (sire) if he is on-site. Observing the parents’ temperament and living conditions gives you crucial insight into what your puppy might be like.
*   **Clean Environment:** The puppies and parent dogs should be raised in a clean, safe, and stimulating environment. This is crucial for their early development and socialization.
*   **Early Socialization:** Puppies should be well-socialized from a young age. They should be handled regularly, exposed to various sights and sounds, and interact positively with people and other animals.
*   **Asking Questions Back:** A good breeder will ask *you* many questions. They want to ensure their puppies go to responsible, loving homes that understand the commitment involved. They might ask about your living situation, experience with dogs, and lifestyle.
*   **Lifetime Support:** They offer ongoing support and advice for the lifetime of the dog. They care about their puppies even after they leave for their new homes.
*   **Waitlist and Contracts:** They may have a waitlist for puppies, indicating high demand and careful planning. They will also provide a written contract, often including a health guarantee.
*   **Not Always Available:** They don't always have puppies available. Breeding is planned, not constant.

### Red Flags to Watch Out For

*   **No Health Clearances:** This is a major red flag. Avoid breeders who cannot provide proof of health testing for the parent dogs.
*   **Multiple Litters Available:** Breeders with many litters available
