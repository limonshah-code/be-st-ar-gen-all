### Clear Answer to the Main Query

You can stop your dog from digging under the fence by installing physical barriers like L-footers, weld mesh, or pavers available at Bunnings. Combine these physical deterrents with consistent behavioral training, increased exercise, mental enrichment, and supervision to address the root cause of their digging.

### Understanding Why Dogs Dig Under The Fence

Dogs dig for many reasons. This natural behavior comes from their instincts. It is not usually about being naughty. Understanding the cause helps us find the best solution.

One common reason is boredom or excess energy. Dogs need physical activity. They also need mental stimulation. If they do not get enough, they create their own fun. Digging can be a fun activity for a bored dog. They might dig to pass the time.

Escape attempts are another big reason. Dogs often dig to get to something on the other side. This could be a squirrel, another dog, or just a new smell. Their prey drive can be very strong. They see a gap and try to reach what they perceive as a target.

Some dogs dig for comfort. They might dig to cool down on a hot day. They might also dig to create a den for shelter. This is especially true for certain breeds. Terriers, for example, are bred for digging. They naturally enjoy this activity.

Anxiety can also cause digging. Some dogs dig when left alone. They might try to escape a stressful situation. This is a sign of separation anxiety. You might notice other signs like barking or destructive chewing. A dog digging under a fence might also indicate they are feeling anxious about being contained, or about things outside the fence. We need to look at their overall behavior to understand this.

### Physical Barriers to Stop Fence Digging

Installing a physical barrier is a direct way to stop fence digging. You create an obstacle your dog cannot get past. This is often the most effective first step. Many simple and affordable materials are available at Bunnings.

One popular method is the L-footer barrier. This involves burying wire mesh at the base of the fence. You bend the mesh at a 90-degree angle. This creates an "L" shape. The vertical part goes up against the fence. The horizontal part extends into your yard. When your dog tries to dig down, they hit the buried mesh. They cannot dig under it because it extends out.

You can use various materials for an L-footer. Galvanized wire mesh or heavy-duty chicken wire work well. Make sure the mesh is strong enough. It needs to withstand your dog's digging efforts. You can secure it to the fence posts. Using sturdy staples or wire ties works best. This type of barrier makes it very difficult for your dog to tunnel out.

Another option is to use rocks or pavers. You can lay these along the entire fence line. Place them tightly together. This creates a hard surface your dog cannot dig through. This method also looks neat in your yard. It can even become a decorative border. It works well if your dog starts digging right at the fence line.

You can also bury the rocks or pavers partially. Dig a shallow trench. Place the rocks or pavers into the trench. This makes them more stable. It also hides them a bit. This creates a durable, long-lasting barrier. Many people find this simple method very effective.

### Top Bunnings Products for Fence Digging Solutions

Bunnings offers a wide range of products perfect for securing your fence. Knowing what to look for makes your project easier. I have found many useful items there for my own fence reinforcement needs.

Weld mesh is an excellent choice for a strong barrier. It is rigid and comes in various heights. You can buy rolls of weld mesh. Choose a gauge that is hard for your dog to chew or bend. This mesh is durable. You can bury it as an L-footer. You can also simply attach it directly to the bottom of your existing fence. Chicken wire is a lighter option. It works for smaller dogs or less persistent diggers. It is also more flexible and easier to install.

Timber sleepers and garden edging offer another solution. Treated pine sleepers are heavy and strong. You can lay them flat along the fence base. They create a solid barrier. Your dog cannot easily move them. Garden edging, made from plastic or metal, is also an option. You can buy rolls of it. Bury it vertically along the fence line. It provides a visual and physical deterrent. These are easy to find in the gardening section at Bunnings.

Concrete mix and pavers are durable, permanent solutions. You can pour a concrete footer along your fence. This creates an impenetrable barrier. It requires more effort but lasts forever. Pavers are easier to install than concrete. You can buy individual pavers. Lay them down side-by-side. Make sure they fit snugly against the fence. These items are readily available in the building materials section. Using these products helps create a strong, secure perimeter for your yard.

### Behavioral Strategies to Deter Dog Digging

Physical barriers are important, but addressing the behavior is key. Dogs often dig out of instinct or unmet needs. I focus on these behavioral aspects. It helps create a happier, more settled dog.

First, ensure your dog gets enough exercise. A tired dog is less likely to dig. Daily walks, runs, or play sessions are crucial. The amount of exercise depends on your dog's breed and energy level. High-energy breeds need more activity. A good exercise routine helps burn off excess energy. This reduces boredom digging.

Mental stimulation is also very important. Dogs need to use their brains. Puzzle toys, training sessions, and interactive games provide mental exercise. Hide-and-seek with treats is a fun game. Teaching new tricks stimulates their minds. A mentally engaged dog is less likely to resort to destructive behaviors like digging. These activities fulfill their natural instincts.

Consider creating a designated digging area. This gives your dog a sanctioned place to dig. Choose a spot away from the fence or garden beds. Bury toys or treats in this area. Encourage your dog to dig there. Praise them when they use it. This redirects their natural digging instinct. It saves your fence and garden from damage. My dog loves her sandpit for digging.

Training your dog to stop undesired digging is possible. When you catch them digging where they should not, interrupt them. Use a firm "No!" or "Leave it!" Then redirect them to their designated digging spot. Reward them for digging in the right place. Consistency is very important. Never punish your dog for past digging. They will not understand why they are being corrected. This approach helps them learn acceptable behaviors.

### Safe Deterrents and Repellents for Digging

Sometimes, you need a little extra help to discourage digging. Safe deterrents and repellents can make an area less appealing. I always choose methods that are harmless to my dog. My dog's safety is my main concern.

Natural scents can be very effective. Dogs dislike certain smells. Citrus scents are often a good deterrent. You can spray diluted lemon juice or orange oil near the digging spots. Coffee grounds are another option. Sprinkle used coffee grounds where your dog digs. The strong smell often makes them avoid the area. Chili powder or cayenne pepper can also deter them. Be careful with these. They can irritate your dog's nose or eyes. I prefer gentler options first.

Commercial digging deterrents are also available. These sprays usually contain bitter or unpleasant-tasting ingredients. Dogs find these tastes very off-putting. Spray them on the fence line or affected areas. Always read the product label. Make sure the product is pet-safe. Reapply these sprays regularly, especially after rain. These products can be found in pet stores or at Bunnings. They offer a ready-made solution.

Making the digging spot unappealing is another strategy. Place large rocks or chicken wire over the area. Dogs do not like digging through these obstacles. Burying plastic netting just below the surface works too. When your dog's paws hit the netting, they get frustrated. This makes the spot less fun to dig in. You can also place their own poop in the hole. Dogs generally do not like digging where they have already relieved themselves. This is a simple, effective trick. Remember to combine deterrents with positive reinforcement for good behavior.

### Consistent Supervision and Yard Management

Even with barriers and training, consistent supervision helps. It reinforces good habits. It also allows you to address new digging attempts quickly. I make sure to always keep an eye on my dog when she is outside.

Monitor your dog's outdoor time, especially at first. Do not just let them out alone. Go outside with them. Watch where they go and what they do. This way, you can catch them if they start to dig. You can then redirect their behavior immediately. Early intervention is important for stopping a habit. If you see them sniffing or scratching near the fence, intervene. Distract them with a toy or call them over for a game.

Regular fence inspections are crucial. Walk your fence line often. Look for any new holes or weak spots. Dogs are persistent. They might find a new area to try digging. Check after heavy rain. Rain can soften the soil and create new opportunities for digging. Addressing weak spots promptly prevents your dog from establishing a new digging habit. Fill any new holes immediately. Reinforce that section of the fence. This constant vigilance helps maintain the integrity of your containment system.

Address escape routes promptly. If your dog successfully digs out once, they learn they can do it again. This makes the habit much harder to break. Immediately fix any escape points. Make the repair stronger than the original fence. Consider doubling up on barriers in problem areas. Consistency in repairing and monitoring keeps your dog safe inside the yard. It also protects your landscaping.

### When to Seek Professional Dog Training Help

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, digging continues. This is when professional help becomes valuable. A qualified dog trainer or behaviorist can offer tailored solutions. I know when to ask for expert advice. It helps my dog and me.

Persistent digging can signal underlying issues. Your dog might have severe anxiety. They might have a very high prey drive. They might even have a compulsive disorder. A professional can assess the specific reasons for your dog's digging. They can observe your dog's behavior. They can also look at your home environment. This comprehensive evaluation helps identify the root cause. Without this understanding, solutions might only be temporary.

A dog trainer can create a personalized training plan. They can teach you effective communication methods. They can show you how to redirect your dog's energy. They can also help with desensitization techniques for anxious dogs. These plans are designed for your dog's unique needs. They go beyond general advice. For example, if your dog's digging is part of broader behavioral issues, a professional can address the entire picture. You might even find help with other [dog fence troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/dog-fence-troubleshooting) issues from a professional.

Considering advanced containment solutions might be an option. While this article focuses on physical fences, professional trainers might suggest others. For instance, they could discuss the pros and cons of electronic fences. These are sometimes called invisible fences. They provide a deterrent through static correction. However, invisible fences do not stop digging. Dogs can still dig under them if motivated. They are more about boundary training above ground. Discuss all options with a trainer. They will guide you to the safest and most effective solution. My goal is always to find the best way to keep my dog safe and happy.
