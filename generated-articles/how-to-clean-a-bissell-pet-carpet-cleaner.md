## Restore Your Bissell Pet Cleaner: A Deep Clean Guide

Pet owners understand the joy pets bring. They also know pet messes are part of life. A Bissell pet carpet cleaner helps keep your home clean and fresh. But what cleans the cleaner itself? Learning how to clean a Bissell pet carpet cleaner correctly is important.

Dirty machines cannot clean well. They can spread odors and dirt instead of removing them. Regular cleaning ensures your Bissell works at its best. It also extends the life of your valuable cleaning tool. This guide shows you step-by-step how to clean your Bissell pet carpet cleaner. You will learn about daily maintenance, deep cleaning, and keeping your home smelling fresh.

### Takeaway

To keep your Bissell Pet Carpet Cleaner working well and smelling fresh:
*   Rinse removable parts after every use.
*   Perform a thorough deep clean every few months.
*   Clean brushes, nozzles, and tanks to prevent clogs and odors.
*   Store the machine dry and assembled in a cool place.

A Bissell pet carpet cleaner requires regular cleaning. First, empty and rinse all tanks. Next, remove and clean brushes, nozzles, and filters under running water. Dry all parts completely before reassembling. This stops odor and ensures your machine cleans effectively.

## Why Cleaning Your Bissell Pet Cleaner Matters

Maintaining your Bissell pet carpet cleaner is not just about looks. It directly affects cleaning performance. Dirty tanks, hoses, and brushes cannot pick up dirt effectively. They can leave behind residue or even spread old pet odors. This defeats the purpose of cleaning your carpets.

Uncleaned parts can also harbor bacteria and mold. This creates unpleasant smells. It can also cause health concerns. A machine that smells bad will make your carpets smell bad too. Regular cleaning prevents these issues. Your home will smell fresh.

Cleaning your machine also protects your investment. Dirt and debris can clog motors and pumps. This causes wear and tear. Over time, clogs lead to expensive repairs or machine failure. Simple maintenance steps extend the lifespan of your Bissell. You save money and keep your cleaner running efficiently for years.

Think about the quality of your carpet cleaning results. A clean machine delivers powerful suction. It applies solutions evenly. It lifts stains and dirt from your carpets. This provides the deep clean your pet-friendly home needs. Your carpets will look cleaner and feel softer.

## Essential Supplies for Cleaning Your Bissell Machine

Before you start cleaning your Bissell pet carpet cleaner, gather your supplies. Having everything ready makes the process smooth. You will need a few basic items found around the house. These items help you clean every part of the machine.

You will need warm water. This helps rinse out dirt and leftover solution. A mild dish soap can help cut through grime. Do not use harsh chemicals or bleach. These can damage plastic parts or internal components. A soft brush or old toothbrush is useful. It helps scrub hard-to-reach areas.

Microfiber cloths or old towels are also important. You will use them to wipe down surfaces. They also help dry parts thoroughly. A bucket or sink provides a place to rinse components. Gloves are optional but can protect your hands. They are good if you are sensitive to dirt or cleaning solutions.

For stubborn clogs, a small tool like a paperclip or pipe cleaner can be helpful. This helps clear nozzles and spray tips. Always check your machine's manual for specific cleaning instructions. Some models have unique parts or cleaning recommendations. Having the right tools makes cleaning your Bissell easy and effective.

## Daily Maintenance After Every Use

Daily maintenance keeps your Bissell pet carpet cleaner in top shape. This simple routine prevents grime buildup. It also stops odors from forming. Performing these steps after each use saves you time later. It also ensures your machine is ready for the next pet mess.

First, empty the dirty water tank immediately. Do not let dirty water sit in the tank. This causes foul odors and bacteria growth. Rinse the tank thoroughly with warm water. Swish the water around and pour it out. You can add a drop of mild soap for extra cleaning.

Next, empty the clean water tank. Rinse it as well. Any leftover cleaning solution can dry and clog lines. Make sure both tanks are completely dry before storing them. Leaving them open to air dry helps prevent mildew. I always leave mine upside down for a few hours.

Wipe down the exterior of the machine. Use a damp cloth to clean any dirt or pet hair. Pay attention to the nozzle and spray areas. Hair and debris can stick there. Removing them now prevents clogs. This quick routine keeps your Bissell looking good and working effectively.

## Deep Cleaning Your Bissell Pet Carpet Cleaner: Step-by-Step

Deep cleaning your Bissell pet carpet cleaner is a crucial task. It goes beyond daily rinses. This comprehensive process tackles hidden grime and ensures peak performance. I recommend a deep clean every few months, or more often if you use your machine frequently.

### Step 1: Disassemble Removable Parts

Start by unplugging your Bissell from the power outlet. Safety is first. Remove the clean water tank and the dirty water tank. Set them aside. Next, detach any removable parts. This includes brush rolls, nozzles, and collection trays. Different Bissell models have unique disassembly steps. Your user manual will show you specifics. Some parts might require a screwdriver. For a detailed guide on disassembling, you can refer to how to take apart a Bissell carpet cleaner to clean.

### Step 2: Clean the Tanks

Thoroughly rinse both the clean and dirty water tanks. Use warm water. For the dirty water tank, a little mild dish soap helps remove residue. Swish vigorously. Pour out the water and rinse again until clear. For persistent odors in the dirty tank, you can use a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes, then rinse well. Make sure to air dry both tanks completely before reassembly. This prevents mold and mildew growth.

### Step 3: Clean the Brush Roll and Brush Housing

The brush roll picks up a lot of pet hair and dirt. It can get matted and clogged. Remove any tangled hair or debris by hand. You might need scissors to cut through stubborn hair tangles. Wash the brush roll under running warm water. Use a soft brush or old toothbrush to scrub bristles clean. Pay attention to the ends where hair often wraps. Clean the brush housing as well. This is the area where the brush roll sits. Wipe it down with a damp cloth. Make sure no hair or debris remains. A clean brush ensures efficient scrubbing.

### Step 4: Clean the Nozzle and Suction Path

The nozzle is where dirty water gets sucked back into the tank. This area often gets clogged. Remove the nozzle if possible. Rinse it under warm running water. Use a small brush or paperclip to clear any blockages. Check the suction path too. This is the channel from the nozzle to the dirty water tank. It should be clear of debris. Sometimes a buildup of lint or hair can restrict suction. Clear any visible blockages. This helps maintain strong suction.

### Step 5: Clean Hoses and Attachments (If Applicable)

Many Bissell pet carpet cleaners come with a hose and attachment tools. These also need cleaning. Detach the hose from the machine. Rinse the hose interior with warm water. You can run water through it until it comes out clear. For attachments like upholstery tools, remove any hair or debris. Rinse them thoroughly. Let all hoses and attachments air dry completely. This prevents stale water smells. My Bissell Little Green cleaner's hose often needs a good rinse.

You can also clean your couch with your Bissell Little Green after cleaning the machine.

### Step 6: Wipe Down the Exterior and Air Dry

Use a damp cloth to wipe down the entire exterior of your Bissell. Clean the base, handle, and any crevices. Remove any dried spills or grime. Once all individual parts are clean, lay them out to air dry completely. This is a very important step. Reassembling a wet machine encourages mold and odor. Give parts several hours or even overnight to dry. A clean, dry machine is ready for storage.

## Cleaning Specific Components: Tanks, Hoses, and Brushes

Each part of your Bissell pet carpet cleaner serves a unique purpose. Each also requires specific cleaning attention. Understanding how to clean tanks, hoses, and brushes properly ensures your machine performs optimally. These components are critical for pet mess cleanup.

### Cleaning the Water Tanks

Your Bissell has a clean water tank and a dirty water tank. Both need regular cleaning. The clean water tank holds your water and cleaning solution. Rinse it well after each use. This prevents residue from drying inside. Dried solution can clog filters or lines over time. The dirty water tank collects all the grime. It is the main source of bad odors. Empty it immediately after use. Rinse it repeatedly with warm water. Swish the water vigorously. For a deeper clean, add a capful of white vinegar to the dirty tank. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. This helps neutralize pet odors. Then, rinse thoroughly until all vinegar smell is gone. Always allow tanks to air dry completely. Storing wet tanks leads to mold and a musty smell.

### Cleaning the Hoses and Attachments

Many Bissell pet carpet cleaners have a hose for spot cleaning. This hose and its attachments are prone to trapping pet hair and dirty water. After using the hose, detach it from the main unit. Hold one end under a faucet. Run warm water through the hose until it comes out clear from the other end. You can gently flex the hose to dislodge any trapped debris. For small nozzle attachments, use a small brush or a straightened paperclip to clear any blockages. These often get clogged with pet hair. Make sure all attachments are free of hair and residue. Air dry them completely before putting them away. A dirty hose can spray old, smelly water onto your fresh carpets. A clean hose ensures you get the best results from your carpet shampooer.

### Cleaning the Brush Rolls and Nozzles

The brush rolls scrub your carpets. They are constantly in contact with pet hair and dirt. Remove the brush roll assembly from your Bissell. Most models have a release latch for this. Carefully remove any tangled hair, strings, or debris. Scissors are useful for cutting through matted hair. Wash the brush roll under warm running water. Use a stiff brush, like an old toothbrush, to scrub between the bristles. Ensure all dirt and pet hair are gone. Also, clean the brush housing where the roll sits. Wipe down the entire area. The nozzle is the clear part at the front of the machine. It sucks up the dirty water. Remove it if possible. Rinse it under warm water. Check for any blockages in the suction path. A paperclip can help clear stubborn clogs. A clean brush and nozzle are vital for powerful cleaning and effective dirt extraction.

## Troubleshooting Common Cleaning Issues

Even after cleaning your Bissell pet carpet cleaner, you might face issues. Common problems include bad smells or reduced suction. Do not worry. Most of these issues have simple solutions. We will address them to ensure your machine performs at its best.

### My Bissell Still Smells Bad

A lingering smell is frustrating. It usually comes from lingering dirty water or mold. First, check your dirty water tank. Did you rinse it thoroughly? Sometimes, old pet urine smell can cling to the plastic. Try a stronger cleaning method. Fill the dirty tank with a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and warm water. Let it sit for an hour. Then, rinse it many times until the smell is gone. Also, inspect the brush roll and suction nozzle. Hair and debris can trap odors. Make sure you removed all tangled hair and rinsed these parts completely. Ensure all parts are fully dry before storing. A damp environment promotes mold growth, which causes bad smells. Leaving tanks open to air dry helps.

### The Machine Has Reduced Suction

Reduced suction means your Bissell is not picking up dirty water well. This is usually due to a clog. Check the nozzle first. It is the clear window at the front that sucks up water. Is it clogged with hair or debris? Remove it and clean it thoroughly. Next, check the suction path. This is the channel from the nozzle to the dirty water tank. Sometimes a large piece of lint or hair can block it. You may need to look inside with a flashlight. Also, check the dirty water tank's filter. Some models have a small filter inside the tank. It can get clogged. Rinse it under warm water to clear it. Finally, ensure all tanks are properly sealed. A loose tank lid can cause air leaks, leading to reduced suction. Make sure all parts are clicked into place.

### My Bissell is Leaking Water

Water leaks are concerning. They can indicate a damaged part or improper assembly. First, check if all tanks are seated correctly. Ensure they are locked firmly into place. A tank not fully engaged can cause leaks. Next, inspect the seals and gaskets. These are rubber rings that create a watertight seal. If a seal is cracked or out of place, it will leak. You might need to replace a damaged seal. Also, check the hose and attachments. A crack in the hose or a loose connection can cause leaks when in use. If you see a visible crack, the part might need replacement. Never use a leaking machine directly on electrical outlets or cords. Address the leak before operating the machine again.

### The Brushes Are Not Spinning

If your brush rolls are not spinning, they cannot scrub carpets. First, ensure no hair or debris is wrapped tightly around the brush ends. This is a common issue with pet cleaners. Use scissors to carefully cut away any tangled hair. Then, remove the brush roll and inspect its housing. Make sure nothing is blocking its movement. Some models have a belt that drives the brushes. If the belt is broken or dislodged, the brushes will not spin. You may need to replace the belt. Consult your Bissell user manual for belt location and replacement instructions. A non-spinning brush means your cleaner is not deep cleaning. It is essential to fix this for effective stain removal.

## Tips for Extending Your Bissell's Lifespan

Keeping your Bissell pet carpet cleaner in top condition extends its working life. A well-maintained machine saves you money and cleans better. Follow these simple tips to ensure your Bissell lasts for many years. These habits go beyond basic cleaning.

Always use genuine Bissell cleaning solutions. Other solutions might contain harsh chemicals. These can damage internal components. They can also leave residue that clogs the machine. Bissell solutions are formulated to work best with their machines. This protects your investment.

Never store your Bissell with water in the tanks. We discussed this in the cleaning sections. Water, especially dirty water, promotes mold, mildew, and bad odors. It also allows mineral deposits to build up. Always empty and air dry both tanks completely after each use. This takes little effort but makes a huge difference.

Store your machine in a dry, cool place. Extreme temperatures can damage plastic parts or electronic components. Do not leave it in a garage that gets very hot or very cold. A closet or utility room is usually a good spot. Make sure it is upright and stable.

Check the filters regularly. Many Bissell models have small filters in the dirty water tank or other areas. These filters trap debris. A clogged filter restricts airflow and suction. Rinse or replace filters as recommended in your user manual. This maintains optimal suction power.

Inspect the power cord and plug regularly. Look for any cuts, fraying, or bent prongs. A damaged cord is a safety hazard. If you find damage, have it repaired by a professional or replace the cord. Never use a machine with a damaged electrical cord. These simple practices help your Bissell remain reliable. You will enjoy clean carpets for a long time.

## FAQ Section

### Why does my Bissell pet carpet cleaner smell bad even after cleaning?
A lingering smell usually means trapped dirty water or mold. Ensure you empty and rinse all tanks immediately after use. Clean the brush roll and suction nozzle thoroughly, removing all hair and debris. Allow all parts, especially tanks, to air dry completely before reassembling. You can also rinse tanks with a white vinegar and water solution to neutralize odors.

### How often should I deep clean my Bissell pet cleaner?
Perform daily maintenance (emptying and rinsing tanks) after every use. A deep clean, involving disassembling and scrubbing components like brushes and nozzles, should be done every few months. If you use your Bissell frequently or have multiple pets, consider a deep clean more often, perhaps once a month.

### Can I use bleach to clean my Bissell machine?

### What if my Bissell loses suction after cleaning it?
Reduced suction often indicates a clog. Check the clear nozzle for blockages from hair or debris. Remove the nozzle and clear any obstructions. Inspect the suction path from the nozzle to the dirty water tank for trapped lint. Also, ensure the dirty water tank filter is clean and that all tanks are properly sealed and clicked into place.

### Where should I store my Bissell pet carpet cleaner after cleaning?
Store your Bissell in a dry, cool place away from extreme temperatures. A utility closet, laundry room, or temperate garage is ideal. Ensure all tanks are completely dry and empty before storage.
