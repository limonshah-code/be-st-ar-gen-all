## Keep Your New Balance 990v5 Clean and Fresh

Your New Balance 990v5 sneakers are more than just shoes. They offer comfort, style, and a great fit. Keeping them clean helps them last longer and look their best. Dirt and grime can break down shoe materials over time. I want to show you how to protect your investment. This guide will walk you through the proper steps to clean New Balance 990v5 shoes. You will learn how to handle different materials and maintain their quality.

**Takeaway:**
*   Always dry brush shoes before wet cleaning.
*   Spot clean suede parts carefully.
*   Use mild soap and soft brushes for mesh and synthetic areas.
*   Allow shoes to air dry completely, away from direct heat.
*   Regular cleaning prevents deep stains and material damage.

To clean New Balance 990v5 shoes, first dry brush to remove loose dirt. Then, use a mild cleaning solution and soft brushes to gently scrub all surfaces. Pay close attention to different materials like suede and mesh. Rinse with a damp cloth and allow the shoes to air dry naturally.

### Preparing Your New Balance 990v5 for Cleaning

Before you start any wet cleaning, prepare your shoes. This step is important for getting the best results. I always take a few minutes to get everything ready. Proper preparation makes the cleaning process easier and more effective.

First, remove the laces from your New Balance 990v5 sneakers. You can wash the laces separately. Place them in a mesh laundry bag to clean in a washing machine, or wash them by hand. Hand washing laces is often gentler. A small brush and some mild soap work well for laces.

Next, use a soft-bristled brush or an old toothbrush. Gently brush off any loose dirt, dust, or mud from the shoe's surface. Work around the entire shoe, including the sole and the upper. This dry brushing prevents dirt from turning into mud when you add water. It also helps expose any deep stains you need to address. This initial step is critical for a thorough clean.

### Gentle Cleaning for Suede Sections

The New Balance 990v5 often features premium suede accents. Suede requires special care during cleaning. Water can damage suede if you are not careful. I always approach suede parts with extra caution.

To clean suede, use a specialized suede brush or a soft-bristled brush. First, gently brush the dirty areas in one direction to lift the nap. For light stains, a suede eraser can work wonders. Rub the eraser gently over the stain. If the stain is stubborn, you might need a very small amount of a dedicated suede cleaner.

Apply the suede cleaner to a clean cloth, not directly onto the shoe. Dab the cloth onto the stained area. Do not rub vigorously. You want to lift the dirt, not spread it or soak the suede. After applying the cleaner, use a dry, clean cloth to blot the area. Let the suede air dry completely. Once dry, use the suede brush to restore the nap.

### Tackling Mesh and Synthetic Uppers

The 990v5 also uses mesh and synthetic materials. These parts are more durable than suede for cleaning. They can handle a bit more moisture. I find these materials are easier to clean.

Prepare a mild cleaning solution. Mix a small amount of laundry detergent or dish soap with warm water in a bowl. You want just enough soap to create a gentle lather. Avoid using harsh chemicals. Strong cleaners can damage the shoe's materials or cause discoloration.

Dip a soft brush, like an old toothbrush or a shoe cleaning brush, into the solution. Gently scrub the mesh and synthetic parts of the upper. Work in small circular motions. Pay attention to dirty spots and creases. Do not press too hard. The goal is to lift the dirt, not to scrub it deeper into the fabric.

### Cleaning the Midsole and Outsole

The midsole and outsole are often the dirtiest parts of your New Balance 990v5. They pick up grime from the ground. Cleaning these parts helps restore the shoe's overall look. I focus on these areas after the upper is clean.

For the midsole, which is often white or light-colored, stubborn scuffs are common. You can use the same mild soap solution. A firmer brush, like a scrub brush or a melamine foam eraser (magic eraser), works well here. Dip the brush in the solution and scrub the midsole. For tough marks, the magic eraser can gently lift scuffs without much effort. Be careful not to apply too much pressure on painted areas.

The outsole, or the bottom of the shoe, needs a good scrub. Dirt and small stones can get stuck in the tread. Use a stiffer brush to clean the outsole. You can also use a toothpick or a small pick to remove any lodged debris. Rinse the outsole with a damp cloth to remove all soap residue. This will help maintain the grip and appearance.

### Spot Treatment and Deep Cleaning Methods

Sometimes your New Balance 990v5 will have tough stains. These stains need more targeted cleaning. I keep a few extra tools on hand for these moments. A regular cleaning might not be enough for deep marks.

For oil or grease stains on non-suede parts, a small amount of baking soda can help. Sprinkle baking soda over the stain and let it sit for a few hours. The powder will absorb the oil. Then, brush it off and clean the area with your mild soap solution. For gum, place the shoe in a plastic bag in the freezer for a few hours. The gum will harden and become easy to chip off.

For general deep cleaning of fabric or synthetic parts, you can consider a specialized shoe cleaner. Follow the product instructions carefully. Always test a small, hidden area first to ensure no discoloration occurs. Use a soft brush to work the cleaner into the stain. Blot with a clean, damp cloth. Avoid soaking the shoes. Excess water can damage the materials and glue.

### Drying Your New Balance 990v5 Properly

After cleaning, drying your New Balance 990v5 is just as important as the cleaning itself. Improper drying can lead to damage. It can also cause odors or mold. I always make sure my shoes dry completely and safely.

Do not put your shoes in a washing machine or dryer. High heat can shrink materials, warp the shape, or melt adhesives. Direct sunlight can also cause discoloration. Always air dry your sneakers. Find a cool, dry place with good air circulation.

Stuff the shoes with white paper towels or clean, dry cloths. This helps absorb excess moisture from the inside. It also helps the shoes keep their shape as they dry. Change the paper towels every few hours until they no longer feel damp. It might take 24-48 hours for your shoes to dry completely. Patience is key to proper shoe care. Make sure the insoles are also removed and dried separately.

### Maintaining Freshness and Preventing Future Stains

Once your New Balance 990v5 are clean, you want to keep them that way. Regular maintenance prevents future damage. I use a few simple tricks to keep my shoes looking great for longer. Prevention is easier than deep cleaning.

Consider applying a water and stain repellent spray. These sprays create a protective barrier on the shoe's surface. They repel liquids and make dirt easier to wipe off. Always choose a spray safe for all materials on your 990v5, especially suede. Test it on a hidden spot first. Reapply the spray every few weeks or months, depending on wear.

Store your sneakers in a cool, dry place when not wearing them. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or damp areas. Using shoe trees can help maintain their shape. If your shoes get wet from rain, clean them promptly and dry them properly before storage. This routine care extends the life and look of your New Balance 990v5.

## FAQ Section

### Can I use household cleaners on my New Balance 990v5?
Avoid using harsh household cleaners like bleach or strong detergents. These can damage materials, cause discoloration, or leave residues. Stick to mild soap mixed with water. For stubborn stains, use cleaners specifically designed for shoes or the material type.

### How do I remove smells from my New Balance 990v5?
To remove odors, sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes and let it sit overnight. The baking soda absorbs smells. You can also use shoe deodorizers or cedar shoe trees. Ensure your shoes are completely dry after cleaning, as moisture causes odors.
