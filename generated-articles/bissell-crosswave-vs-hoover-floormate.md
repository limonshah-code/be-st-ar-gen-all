## Bissell Crosswave Vs Hoover Floormate: Which Hard Floor Cleaner Wins?

Cleaning hard floors can be a chore. Sweeping, vacuuming, and then mopping takes time. Many people want a simpler way to keep their homes clean. That is where multi-surface floor cleaners come in.

Today, we look at two popular options: the Bissell Crosswave and the Hoover Floormate. Both machines promise to simplify your cleaning routine. They both vacuum and wash your floors at the same time. This article breaks down their features, performance, and more. I will help you decide which machine fits your home and needs best. You will learn about their cleaning power, design, and how easy they are to maintain. This comparison of the Bissell Crosswave Vs Hoover Floormate will give you clear answers.

### Takeaway

*   **Bissell Crosswave** excels in versatility and wet vacuuming performance for homes with mixed hard floors and area rugs, especially those with pets.
*   **Hoover Floormate** provides strong scrubbing action and efficient drying, making it a good choice for predominantly hard floor homes seeking deep cleaning at a competitive price.
*   Your ideal choice depends on factors like floor types, presence of pets, budget, and desired cleaning features.

### Clear Answer

The Bissell Crosswave generally offers more versatility across various floor types, including area rugs, with better wet vacuuming capabilities. The Hoover Floormate focuses on deep scrubbing hard floors, providing excellent cleaning and drying for a dedicated hard floor solution.

## Understanding the Contenders: Bissell Crosswave vs Hoover Floormate Overview

When you want clean floors, these two machines often appear in your search. The Bissell Crosswave and the Hoover Floormate both offer a "two-in-one" cleaning approach. They combine vacuuming loose debris with wet mopping. This means you do not need separate steps for dirt and spills. You save time and effort.

The Bissell Crosswave line, including models like the Pet Pro, is known for its ability to clean both hard floors and area rugs. It has strong suction and a multi-surface brush roll. This design helps it pick up pet hair and tough messes. People often choose it for its all-around capability.

The Hoover Floormate, with models like the Deluxe, focuses primarily on hard floors. It uses SpinScrub brushes that rotate to scrub floors clean. This system is good for dislodging stuck-on grime. It also has a unique "Dual Tank" system to keep clean and dirty water separate. Both machines aim to simplify your cleaning. They just approach it in slightly different ways.

## Cleaning Performance: Hard Floors and Area Rugs

The main reason you buy one of these machines is for its cleaning ability. How well do the Bissell Crosswave and the Hoover Floormate perform on different surfaces? This is where their core strengths show. I want to see how effectively they clean up common messes.

### Hard Floor Cleaning Efficiency

On hard floors like tile, sealed hardwood, laminate, and vinyl, both machines do a good job. The Bissell Crosswave uses a rotating brush roll and suction to clean. It sprays a solution, scrubs, and then vacuums up the dirty water. I find that it removes everyday dirt and light spills well. It leaves floors looking clean without excessive water. For bigger, stickier messes, you might need a second pass or to pre-treat the area.

The Hoover Floormate uses multiple counter-rotating brushes. These brushes scrub the floor from different angles. This provides a deep cleaning action. It is very effective at breaking down grime and dried-on spills. The Floormate also has a dedicated "Wash" and "Dry" mode. This allows you to apply water, scrub, and then use strong suction to dry the floor quickly. For deep hard floor cleaning, the Floormate often delivers a more intense scrub. It often leaves floors dryer faster due to its powerful suction dedicated to water pickup.

### Area Rug Capabilities

This is a key difference. The Bissell Crosswave is designed to clean area rugs as well as hard floors. It has a specific setting for area rugs. This setting uses less water and a gentler brush rotation. It helps to refresh low-pile rugs and remove light stains. It is not a deep carpet cleaner like a dedicated shampooer. However, it is handy for quick clean-ups or refreshing high-traffic areas on rugs. If you need to clean your Bissell Crosswave after tackling those rugs, follow these steps to [how to clean a Bissell Crosswave](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-bissell-crosswave).

The Hoover Floormate, on the other hand, is primarily for hard floors. It does not have an area rug mode. Its SpinScrub brushes are too aggressive for most rugs. Trying to use it on carpets or rugs can damage them. If your home has a mix of hard floors and area rugs you plan to clean with one machine, the Crosswave is the clear winner here. If you only have hard floors, the Floormate's dedicated hard floor power stands out.

## Design and Usability: Weight, Maneuverability, and Controls

Beyond cleaning power, a machine's design and how easy it is to use matter a lot. A powerful cleaner is not helpful if it is too heavy or difficult to operate. I consider how a machine feels in my hand and how it moves around furniture.

### Ergonomics and Weight

The Bissell Crosswave generally weighs less than the Hoover Floormate. This makes it easier to push around, carry up stairs, or maneuver in tight spaces. Its slim profile helps it get under furniture. The handle design is comfortable for most users. If you have multiple levels in your home or struggle with heavy lifting, the Crosswave is often a better choice. I find it feels nimble.

The Hoover Floormate is a bit heavier and bulkier. This weight provides stability during its powerful scrubbing action. However, it can feel more cumbersome to move. It is less suited for homes with many stairs. Its design is more upright and less sleek. For extensive hard floor areas where you do not need to lift it often, its weight is less of a concern.

### Water Tanks and Refilling

Both machines use a two-tank system to separate clean and dirty water. This is crucial for hygiene. The Bissell Crosswave has easily removable tanks. The clean water tank sits on the back, and the dirty water tank is in front. They are clear, so you can see water levels. Refilling the clean tank and emptying the dirty tank is straightforward. The dirty water tank can sometimes be a bit messy to clean out completely.

The Hoover Floormate also has a dual tank system. Its tanks are also easy to access. The clean water tank holds cleaning solution. The dirty water tank collects the dirty water. Many users appreciate the Hoover's dirty water tank design. It tends to be easier to rinse clean than some Bissell models. Knowing [how to clean your Hoover carpet cleaner's dirty water tank](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hoover-powerdash-pet-dirty-water-tank) specifically can make this process even simpler and more effective.

### Controls and Modes

The controls on the Bissell Crosswave are simple. There are buttons on the handle for "Hard Floor" and "Area Rug" modes. There is also a spray trigger. This design is intuitive. You press the mode you need, pull the trigger to dispense solution, and move the machine. It is easy to switch between surfaces.

The Hoover Floormate has a "Wash" and "Dry" pedal. You press "Wash" to apply solution and scrub. You press "Dry" to only use suction for drying. This is a powerful feature for getting floors dry quickly. The controls are on the base of the unit or foot pedal. This requires you to bend down to switch modes. Some find this less convenient than handle-mounted controls. However, the dedicated dry mode is a big plus for many.

## Maintenance and Cleaning of Your Machine

Keeping your floor cleaner clean is vital for its performance and longevity. If you do not clean the machine, it can start to smell bad or leave streaks. I always look at how easy it is to maintain a cleaning appliance.

### Brush Roll Care

The brush roll on the Bissell Crosswave is easy to remove. You just pull off a cover and lift the brush out. This allows you to rinse off hair and debris. It is important to clean the brush roll after each use, especially if you have pets. Hair can tangle around it. This is a common maintenance task for any multi-surface cleaner. To ensure your machine keeps running well, you can learn more about [how to clean Bissell Crosswave](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bissell-crosswave).

The Hoover Floormate also has removable brushes. These SpinScrub brushes pop out. They are typically smaller and sometimes easier to rinse clean individually. Since there are multiple brushes, it takes a moment longer to remove all of them. However, they are effective at releasing dirt. Cleaning these brushes helps prevent odors and ensures good scrubbing power.

### Tank and Filter Cleaning

Both machines require you to clean their dirty water tanks after each use. The Bissell Crosswave's dirty tank is generally easy to empty. Sometimes, hair and debris can get stuck around the filter or in crevices. A quick rinse usually solves this. The filter also needs regular cleaning. If you fail to clean the filter, it can impact suction.

The Hoover Floormate's dirty water tank is also straightforward. It has a wide opening which helps in rinsing it thoroughly. The filters are also accessible. Hoover models are generally known for their thoughtful tank design, which makes them easy to clean. If you own a Hoover, understanding [how to clean Hoover carpet cleaner](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hoover-carpet-cleaner) often includes similar steps for tank and filter care.

### Self-Cleaning Cycles

Some Bissell Crosswave models, especially newer ones, feature a self-cleaning cycle. You put the machine on its dock, add a bit of water to a special tray, and press a button. The machine runs water through the brush roll and suction path. This helps flush out debris and solution from inside the unit. This feature is a big time-saver. It keeps the machine fresh and reduces manual cleaning.

The Hoover Floormate models typically do not have an integrated self-cleaning cycle. Cleaning requires manual rinsing of the tanks and brushes. This is not a deal-breaker for many, but it is something to consider. If you value automated maintenance, the self-cleaning feature on some Crosswave models adds significant convenience.

## Features and Specializations: Pet Hair and Accessories

Beyond basic cleaning, specific features can make a big difference. If you have pets, or if you appreciate extra tools, these details matter. I always check what each machine offers beyond just cleaning floors.

### Pet Hair Management

For homes with furry friends, pet hair is a constant battle. The Bissell Crosswave Pet Pro model, in particular, is designed with pet owners in mind. It often includes a multi-surface pet brush roll that resists hair wrapping. It also has a multi-surface pet cleaning formula to tackle odors. The strong suction is good at picking up both wet and dry pet messes. My experience is that Crosswave models handle pet hair well. You do need to clean the brush roll often.

The Hoover Floormate does a decent job with pet hair on hard floors because of its strong suction and scrubbing brushes. However, it is not specifically designed for pet hair in the same way the Crosswave Pet Pro is. It does not have specialized tangle-free brushes. If you have long pet hair, it might wrap around the Floormate's brushes. For general pet mess cleanup on hard floors, the Floormate is effective. For specialized pet features and dealing with hair on rugs, the Crosswave often has an edge.

### Included Accessories

The accessories that come with your cleaner can add value. Bissell Crosswave models usually come with a storage tray. This tray collects drips and allows the brush roll to dry. Some models also include an extra brush roll and a sample of cleaning solution. These small additions improve the user experience. Having a spare brush roll means you can rotate them for drying or if one gets too dirty.

Hoover Floormate models typically come with a storage mat. They might include different brush sets, such as grout brushes or SpinScrub brushes tailored for specific floor types. They often include a sample of cleaning solution as well. The accessory offerings for both brands are practical. Neither one overwhelms you with unnecessary attachments. They focus on the core function.

### Cleaning Solutions and Formulas

Both Bissell and Hoover recommend using their own brand-specific cleaning solutions. These solutions are formulated to work best with their machines. Using other brands can sometimes void your warranty. It can also cause excessive foaming or residue. Bissell offers a wider range of formulas. They have specific ones for pets, wood floors, and even sanitizing. This variety allows you to customize your cleaning.

Hoover also has a range of solutions, though perhaps fewer specialized options than Bissell. Their solutions are effective for hard floor cleaning. It is important to always use the correct dilution. Using too much solution can leave a sticky residue. Using too little may not clean effectively. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for the best results and to keep your machine in good condition.

## Price, Value, and Warranty

Cost is a major factor for most buyers. It is not just the initial price. You also need to consider the long-term value. This includes the cost of replacement parts and cleaning solutions. I always think about what you get for your money.

### Initial Investment

Generally, the Hoover Floormate models tend to be more affordable than the Bissell Crosswave. You can often find a Floormate Deluxe at a lower price point. This makes it an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers. It offers good hard floor cleaning performance without a high upfront cost.

The Bissell Crosswave line, especially higher-end models like the Pet Pro or Cordless versions, usually carries a higher price tag. This higher cost reflects its versatility (hard floors and rugs), advanced features, and often stronger suction for wet vacuuming. If you need those extra capabilities, the Crosswave's price can be justified.

### Long-Term Value

When thinking about long-term value, consider consumables. Both machines require specific cleaning solutions. The cost of these solutions can add up over time. Replacement brush rolls and filters are also a factor. Generally, prices for these consumables are comparable between the two brands. However, since the Crosswave might use more specialized formulas (e.g., for pets), those could be slightly more expensive.

The durability of the machines also plays a role in long-term value. Both brands generally produce reliable cleaners. User reviews suggest that both can last several years with proper care. The decision often comes down to how much you value the Crosswave's versatility versus the Floormate's dedicated hard floor scrubbing. If you plan to use it heavily on both hard floors and rugs, the Crosswave's extra features might offer better value despite the higher initial cost.

### Warranty and Customer Support

Both Bissell and Hoover typically offer a limited one-year warranty on their floor cleaning machines. This warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship. It is important to register your product after purchase. Keep your receipt as proof of purchase. Always check the specific warranty terms for the model you buy.

Customer support experiences can vary with any brand. Both Bissell and Hoover have extensive online resources. They offer FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and product manuals. They also have phone and email support. Many common issues can be resolved with simple [Bissell Crosswave troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/bissell-crosswave-troubleshooting) steps. Similarly, if you encounter problems with your Hoover, looking up [Hoover Smartwash troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/hoover-smartwash-troubleshooting) or other specific model guides can often provide solutions. Based on user feedback, both companies generally provide acceptable support when issues arise.

## Real-World Scenarios: Who Benefits Most?

Choosing between the Bissell Crosswave and the Hoover Floormate really comes down to your specific cleaning needs. There is no single "best" machine for everyone. It depends on your home, your lifestyle, and what you prioritize in a cleaner. I like to think about who gains the most from each machine.

### Ideal User for Bissell Crosswave

The Bissell Crosswave is an excellent choice for a few specific types of users.

## FAQ Section

### Q1: Can the Bissell Crosswave and Hoover Floormate be used on all hard floor types?

Both machines are safe for sealed hard floors, including tile, sealed hardwood, laminate, and vinyl. Always ensure your hardwood floors are sealed before using any wet cleaner. Neither machine should be used on unsealed or unglazed floors, as excessive moisture can cause damage.

### Q2: What is the main difference between wet vacuuming and traditional mopping?

Wet vacuuming with machines like these vacuums up dry debris and wet cleans at the same time. Traditional mopping typically involves sweeping first, then using a wet mop that pushes dirty water around. Wet vacuums extract the dirty water, leaving floors cleaner.

### Q3: Are specialized cleaning solutions required for these machines?

Yes, both Bissell and Hoover recommend using their brand-specific cleaning solutions. These are formulated to prevent foaming and ensure optimal cleaning without harming the machine or your floors. Using other solutions can void warranties or cause performance issues.

You should empty and rinse the dirty water tank and clean the brush roll after every single use. This prevents odors, mold growth, and ensures proper hygiene. The clean water tank should also be rinsed periodically. Filters also require regular cleaning, often every few uses.

### Q5: Can these machines handle large spills or only light cleaning?

They can handle small to medium spills effectively. For very large liquid spills, it is often better to use towels first to absorb the bulk. These machines are designed for cleaning and vacuuming up normal wet messes and everyday dirt, not flood-level spills.

### Q6: Are replacement parts readily available for both models?

Yes, both Bissell and Hoover are major brands. Replacement parts like brush rolls, filters, and tanks are widely available. You can find them on their respective official websites, through authorized retailers, and on major online marketplaces.

## Conclusion

Deciding between the Bissell Crosswave and the Hoover Floormate comes down to your specific needs. Both machines offer a convenient way to clean your hard floors. They combine vacuuming and washing into one step. This saves you time and effort. I have found both to be valuable tools in different situations.

The Bissell Crosswave is an excellent choice if you have a variety of floor types, including hard floors and low-pile area rugs. It is also a top pick for pet owners, as it handles pet hair and messes very well. Its versatility and easy maneuverability make it a popular all-around cleaner.

The Hoover Floormate shines on homes with mostly hard floors. Its powerful SpinScrub brushes provide a deep cleaning action. The dedicated dry mode gets your floors dry quickly. If you want a robust hard floor cleaner at a more budget-friendly price, the Floormate is a strong contender.

Ultimately, your perfect floor cleaner fits your home's unique demands. Consider your floor types, whether you have pets, your budget, and how important features like a self-cleaning cycle are to you. Evaluate the "Bissell Crosswave Vs Hoover Floormate" comparison carefully. Make the informed decision that brings you cleaner floors with less hassle.
