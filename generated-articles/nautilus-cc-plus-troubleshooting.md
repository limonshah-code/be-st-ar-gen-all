The Nautilus CC Plus often faces issues related to power, movement, and cleaning effectiveness. Most Nautilus CC Plus troubleshooting steps involve checking connections, cleaning filters, removing debris from tracks or brushes, and ensuring the power supply works correctly. These basic checks resolve many common problems quickly.

## Understanding Common Nautilus CC Plus Power Issues

One common problem for pool owners is when their Nautilus CC Plus shows no power. The cleaner does not turn on. This can be very frustrating. I always check the power supply first. It is a simple step, but often overlooked.

### No Power: First Steps to Check

Your Nautilus CC Plus needs a stable power connection. First, check the wall outlet. Plug another appliance into the same outlet. This checks if the outlet works. If the outlet has no power, check your home's circuit breaker. A tripped breaker stops electricity flow.

Next, examine the power supply unit (PSU) itself. Is the PSU plugged into the wall securely? Is the cord from the PSU plugged into the cleaner's handle correctly? Sometimes, a loose connection causes problems. Look for any visible damage on the power cord or the PSU. A damaged cord needs replacement. Remember, replacing parts yourself might void a warranty. You can find more detailed help on [Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/dolphin-nautilus-cc-plus-troubleshooting) for these power concerns.

### Power Supply Unit (PSU) Indicator Lights

The Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus power supply unit has indicator lights. These lights tell you the PSU status. Check if the indicator light is on. If it is off, the PSU might be faulty or not receiving power. If it flickers, power could be unstable.

If the light is on but the cleaner does not start, the issue might be with the cleaner itself. Try resetting the PSU. Unplug it from the wall for a minute. Then plug it back in. This often clears minor electrical glitches. Make sure no water has entered the PSU. Water damage can ruin the unit. Always keep the PSU away from the pool edge.

## Resolving Nautilus CC Plus Movement Problems

Your Nautilus CC Plus should move freely in the pool. If it stays still or moves slowly, it cannot clean effectively. Many factors can stop its movement. I look at the tracks, wheels, and brushes first. These parts are critical for movement.

### Cleaner Not Moving or Stuck

Debris is a frequent culprit for a stuck cleaner. Small leaves, twigs, or pool toys can block the cleaner’s tracks or wheels. Turn off and unplug the cleaner before you inspect it. Carefully remove any debris caught in the tracks. Check under the cleaner for larger items.

The tracks themselves might be worn out. If the rubber tracks are loose or damaged, the cleaner loses grip. It cannot move properly. Worn tracks need replacement. Ensure the cleaner's brushes rotate freely. If they are tangled, the cleaner struggles to move. Untangle any hair or string from the brushes.

### Cleaner Moving Slowly or Randomly

A slow-moving Nautilus CC Plus might have a dirty filter. When filters are full, the cleaner works harder. This reduces its speed and efficiency. Clean your filter baskets after every use. Rinse them thoroughly with a hose. A clean filter lets water flow freely.

Sometimes, air bubbles get trapped inside the cleaner. This can make it move erratically or float. Submerge the cleaner fully in the water. Tilt it gently from side to side. This helps trapped air escape. Ensure no large air pockets remain. Proper submergence ensures the cleaner performs optimally.

## Fixing Poor Cleaning Performance of Nautilus CC Plus

You want your pool sparkling clean. When your Nautilus CC Plus leaves dirt behind, it is frustrating. This issue usually points to filter problems or brush wear. I always check these components first. Clean filters are key for effective dirt collection.

### Cleaner Not Picking Up Debris

The most common reason for poor debris collection is a full or dirty filter basket. The Nautilus CC Plus has large filter baskets. They collect a lot of debris. But when full, they cannot pick up more. Empty and rinse the filter baskets after each cleaning cycle. You should see clear water coming through the filter material. For more comprehensive insights, check this article on [Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/dolphin-nautilus-cc-plus-troubleshooting).

The filter material itself might be clogged. Over time, fine dirt and algae can clog the filter's pores. Regular rinsing might not be enough. Periodically clean the filters with a degreaser or specialized filter cleaner. This breaks down oil and stubborn grime. Let them soak as directed. Then rinse them well.

### Brushes and Impeller Issues

Worn brushes reduce cleaning power. The brushes agitate the pool surface, loosening dirt. If your Nautilus CC Plus brushes are flat or damaged, they cannot scrub effectively. Inspect the brushes for wear. If they look worn, replace them. New brushes improve cleaning significantly.

The impeller pulls water through the filter. If the impeller is blocked, water flow is weak. This means less suction and poorer cleaning. Turn off and unplug the cleaner. Remove the filter baskets. Look inside the impeller area for debris. Use a small tool to clear any blockages. Be gentle to avoid damaging the impeller blades.

## Addressing Nautilus CC Plus Cord Problems

The floating power cord is a unique feature of robot pool cleaners. It lets the cleaner move freely. However, cords can tangle or get damaged. A tangled cord affects the cleaner’s movement and coverage. I find cord management crucial for proper operation.

### Cord Tangling and Twisting

Cord tangling is a frequent complaint. It limits the cleaner's reach. To prevent tangles, stretch the cord out straight before placing the cleaner in the pool. Coil it loosely when storing. Avoid leaving excess cord lying on the pool deck.

Sometimes, the swivel on the cord needs attention. The Nautilus CC Plus cord has a swivel feature. This helps prevent tangles. If the swivel is stiff, it cannot do its job. Rinse the swivel with fresh water. You can also gently twist it to loosen it. If it remains stiff, it might need replacement. This ensures the cleaner can move freely around your pool without getting stuck. This specific issue is well-covered in more general [Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/dolphin-nautilus-cc-plus-troubleshooting) guides.

### Damaged or Broken Cord

A damaged cord is a safety hazard. Frayed wires or exposed insulation mean danger. Always inspect the cord before and after each use. Look for cuts, cracks, or pinch marks. Never use a cleaner with a damaged power cord.

If the cord is damaged, it needs professional repair or replacement. Do not try to tape or patch a damaged cord. Water and electricity are a dangerous mix. Contact customer service or an authorized service center. They can provide a new, safe cord. Proper cord care extends the life of your cleaner.

## Understanding Nautilus CC Plus Error Indicators

Your Nautilus CC Plus may have indicator lights or display specific error codes. These signals help diagnose problems. They point you to the area needing attention. I always check the user manual first when I see an unfamiliar light. The manual provides specific meanings.

### Interpreting Error Lights

Different colored or blinking lights on the power supply unit indicate various states. A solid green light usually means normal operation. A blinking light might signal a fault. Refer to your owner's manual for specific light patterns. The manual lists common error codes.

For example, a red light might mean a motor overload. This happens if debris jams the motor. Turn off the cleaner. Unplug it. Then clear any obstructions from the impeller or brushes. After clearing, restart the cleaner. The light should turn green. If it stays red, the motor might be damaged.

### Troubleshooting Specific Error Codes

Some advanced models display numeric error codes. These codes are very specific. Each number points to a particular issue. For instance, an E1 or E2 code might indicate a sensor problem. An E3 code could mean an issue with the motor.

When you see an error code, write it down. Then consult your Nautilus CC Plus user manual. The manual explains what each code means. It also tells you the recommended steps to fix it. If you cannot find the manual, search online for "[Nautilus CC Plus error codes]". Many online resources offer solutions for specific codes. If the problem persists after following manual steps, service might be needed.

## Essential Nautilus CC Plus Maintenance Tips

Regular maintenance prevents many problems. It also extends the life of your Nautilus CC Plus. Simple steps after each use make a big difference. I try to make maintenance a routine habit. This keeps my cleaner running smoothly for years.

### Post-Cleaning Routine

After each cleaning cycle, remove the cleaner from the pool. Disconnect the power cord from the power supply unit. Then, open the filter compartment. Remove the filter baskets. Empty all debris into a trash can. Rinse the filter baskets thoroughly with a garden hose. Ensure all dirt and fine particles wash away.

Next, gently rinse the cleaner's exterior. Use fresh water to remove any chlorine residue or dirt from its body, tracks, and brushes. This prevents chemical buildup. Allow the cleaner to dry completely before storing it. Store it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. Proper storage prevents damage to electrical components and rubber parts.

### Deep Cleaning and Inspection

Every few weeks, perform a deeper clean. Soak the filter baskets in a mild detergent solution. This helps remove stubborn oil and calcium deposits. Rinse them extremely well afterward. Chemicals left on filters can harm pool water.

Inspect the brushes for wear or damage. Check the tracks for cracks or excessive looseness. Look at the power cord for any signs of fraying or damage. Ensure the impeller area is free of debris. Regular inspection helps catch small problems before they become big ones. A well-maintained cleaner performs better and lasts longer.

## When to Seek Professional Help

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, a problem persists. Some issues are too complex for DIY fixes. Knowing when to call a professional saves time and prevents further damage. I usually contact support when parts are damaged or internal systems fail.

### Issues Requiring Expert Intervention

Internal electrical problems are best left to experts. If the cleaner turns on but behaves erratically, it might have an internal circuit issue. Motor failure is another complex problem. These components are sealed. Trying to fix them yourself can void the warranty or cause more damage.

If your Nautilus CC Plus is still under warranty, contact the manufacturer or the retailer first. Unauthorized repairs can invalidate your warranty. They can guide you to an authorized service center. They have specialized tools and knowledge. Getting professional help ensures proper repair and safety.

### Finding Authorized Service Centers

The Dolphin website is a good starting point to find authorized service centers. Look for a "support" or "service" section. Enter your location to find nearby repair shops. You can also call their customer service line. They will provide a list of certified technicians.

Before sending your cleaner for repair, describe the issue clearly. Provide any error codes you observed. This helps technicians diagnose the problem faster. A detailed description saves diagnostic time. It also helps them prepare parts needed for the repair. Your Nautilus CC Plus is a significant investment. Protecting it with proper care and professional service is wise.
