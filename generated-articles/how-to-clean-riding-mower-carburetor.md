### How a Carburetor Works

A carburetor operates on simple principles. Fuel enters the float bowl. A float and needle valve control fuel levels. When the engine draws air, it creates a vacuum. This vacuum pulls fuel from the bowl through small passages and jets. Air mixes with this fuel, forming a fine mist. This mist then goes into the engine for combustion.

The main parts include the float bowl, jets, and throttle plate. Jets are tiny openings that control fuel flow. The throttle plate controls airflow. All these parts must be clean. If any part gets dirty, it affects the fuel-air mix. This directly impacts engine performance. Learning about each part helps you clean them effectively.
