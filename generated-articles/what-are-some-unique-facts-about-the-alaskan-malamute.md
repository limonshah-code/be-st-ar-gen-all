### The Mighty Double Coat

One of the most striking **unique facts about the Alaskan Malamute** is their coat. They have a dense, plush double coat. This coat is their primary defense against the harsh Arctic weather. The outer coat consists of coarse guard hairs. These hairs shed snow and ice. The undercoat is thick, woolly, and oily. This traps warm air close to the body. This combination creates superior insulation.

This coat requires significant grooming. Owners must manage shedding, especially during seasonal blows. Without proper care, the coat can mat. This compromises its insulating properties. A healthy coat is vital for a Malamute's well-being. It helps them regulate their body temperature effectively. If you want to know
