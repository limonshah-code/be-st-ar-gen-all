## Understanding How Long a Dog Recovers from Being High

It is a scary moment when you realize your dog might have ingested something they should not have. Many pet owners face concern when their dog accidentally consumes cannabis. Understanding **how long it takes for a dog to recover from being high** becomes a top priority. This situation requires quick action and careful observation.

Accidental ingestion of marijuana, specifically THC, can cause various symptoms in dogs. These symptoms range from mild disorientation to severe neurological issues. The recovery period depends on several factors, including the amount consumed and the dog's size. We will discuss the signs of intoxication, what to do immediately, and the typical recovery timeline. Our guide helps you understand this pet emergency. It helps you ensure your dog gets the best care for a safe recovery.

### Takeaway

*   **Seek immediate veterinary attention:** Contact your vet or an emergency clinic right away if you suspect cannabis ingestion.
*   **Understand symptoms:** Learn to recognize signs like lethargy, unsteadiness, or dilated pupils.
*   **Prepare for variable recovery:** Recovery time for a dog from being high varies, typically lasting 24-72 hours.
*   **Provide supportive care:** Keep your dog comfortable, quiet, and hydrated under vet guidance.
*   **Prevent future incidents:** Store all cannabis products securely out of your dog's reach.

A dog typically recovers from being high within 24 to 72 hours with proper veterinary support. The exact duration depends on the amount of THC ingested, the dog's size, age, and overall health. Larger doses or more potent products mean longer recovery times. Veterinary intervention greatly improves recovery and comfort.

## What Happens When a Dog Gets High? Understanding Canine Marijuana Exposure

Dogs often show signs of being "high" after ingesting products containing tetrahydrocannabinol, known as THC. THC is the psychoactive compound found in marijuana. Dogs are more sensitive to THC than humans. They have more cannabinoid receptors in their brains. This makes them experience more intense effects from smaller amounts. Ingestion can happen from discarded joints, edibles, or even medical marijuana products. Many dogs like the smell or taste of edibles, which puts them at risk.

When a dog consumes THC, the substance quickly absorbs into their system. It affects the brain and nervous system. The effects can vary widely based on the amount of THC ingested. They also depend on the dog's body weight and individual sensitivity. Some dogs might become very drowsy, while others show extreme agitation. This exposure is not just about feeling "high"; it is a medical emergency for your pet.

The most common source of exposure is edibles, like brownies or cookies. These often contain other harmful ingredients like chocolate or xylitol, adding to the danger. Dogs might find these on walks or in unsecured homes. It is vital to recognize that any form of cannabis, including medical marijuana, can be toxic to dogs. Pet owners must store these items safely away from pets.

## Recognizing the Immediate Signs Your Dog Is High

Knowing the signs of THC toxicity in dogs is very important. Early recognition helps you act fast. Symptoms usually appear within 30 minutes to a few hours after ingestion. They can last for several days. One common sign is ataxia, or loss of coordination. Your dog might seem wobbly or stumble when walking. They might appear disoriented and unable to stand straight.

Another frequent symptom is extreme lethargy or drowsiness. Your dog might be unusually sleepy or unresponsive. Some dogs become agitated or hyperactive instead. Their pupils might be dilated, making their eyes look glassy or wide. You might also notice increased drooling or a slow heart rate. In some severe cases, dogs can experience tremors, seizures, or even fall into a coma.

My dog once ate a piece of something off the street, and I noticed these signs quickly. His eyes were wide, and he moved like he was walking on clouds. It was unsettling. Early action helped him recover faster. If you see these changes, do not wait. Prompt action helps reduce the severity of symptoms and speeds up recovery. The quicker you recognize the signs, the sooner you can get help.

## What to Do If Your Dog Ingests Marijuana

Discovering your dog ate marijuana can be frightening. Your immediate actions greatly impact your dog's recovery. The first and most important step is to stay calm. Panic helps no one. Your dog needs you to be clear-headed. Next, gather any information you can about the exposure. This includes the type of cannabis product (e.g., flower, edible, vape cartridge), the estimated amount consumed, and how long ago it happened. This information is critical for your veterinarian.

Contact your veterinarian immediately. If your regular vet is closed, find the nearest emergency veterinary clinic. Do not try to induce vomiting at home without direct instruction from a vet. Inducing vomiting can be dangerous in some cases, especially if your dog is already sedated or showing neurological signs. They might inhale vomit into their lungs. The vet will assess your dog's condition and recommend the best course of action.

Your vet might induce vomiting if ingestion was very recent. They might give activated charcoal to absorb toxins. They will then provide supportive care. This could involve intravenous fluids, temperature regulation, and medications to manage symptoms. Your role is to monitor your dog closely and follow all veterinary instructions. Getting help quickly helps your dog get better faster.

## Factors Influencing a Dog's Recovery Time from THC Exposure

The question, "how long does it take for a dog to recover from being high," has no single answer. Several factors influence the recovery period. These factors help determine the severity of symptoms and the duration of the illness. Understanding them helps manage expectations during your dog's recovery.

### The Amount of THC Ingested

The quantity of THC a dog consumes is the primary factor. A small amount might cause mild, short-lived symptoms. A larger dose leads to more severe and prolonged effects. Edibles often contain higher concentrations of THC, making them particularly dangerous. The concentration in cannabis products varies greatly. Products like concentrates (oils, waxes) contain much higher THC levels than dried plant material. Higher potency means a greater risk and a longer recovery for your dog.

### Dog's Size, Age, and Health

A dog's body weight plays a significant role. A small dog will feel stronger effects from the same amount of THC than a large dog. Older dogs or those with underlying health conditions might experience more severe symptoms. Their bodies process toxins less efficiently. Young puppies are also at higher risk due to their developing systems. Their ability to metabolize substances is not fully mature. A healthy adult dog typically handles exposure better than a sick or very old one.

### Type of Cannabis Product

Different cannabis products have varied THC concentrations and absorption rates. Raw plant material might have less impact than highly concentrated oils or edibles. Edibles are especially concerning because they often contain butter or other fats. Fats enhance THC absorption. This leads to a faster onset and more intense effects. Brownies or cookies can also contain other toxins like chocolate or xylitol, complicating the situation. A vet needs to know the exact product your dog ate. This helps them tailor treatment. Learning [how long it takes for a dog to get sick from something they ate](https://beacleaner.com/how-long-does-it-take-for-a-dog-to-get-sick-from-something-they-ate) in general can provide a broader context on ingestion risks.

### Veterinary Intervention and Supportive Care

Prompt and effective veterinary care significantly shortens recovery time. If you seek professional help quickly, the vet can intervene to prevent further absorption of THC. They can also manage symptoms. Supportive care, such as IV fluids, helps flush the system and keeps the dog hydrated. Medications can control seizures or extreme agitation. Without proper vet care, a dog's recovery can be much longer and more complicated. Sometimes, dogs who ingest foreign objects might need help to pass them. Understanding [how long does it take for a dog to poop out something he ate](https://beacleaner.com/how-long-does-it-take-for-a-dog-to-poop-out-something-he-ate) can be useful in other ingestion scenarios.

### Individual Dog Sensitivity

Just like humans, individual dogs can have different sensitivities to substances. Some dogs might be more sensitive to THC, showing stronger reactions even to small doses. This is not always predictable. It makes quick observation and vet consultation even more important. Some dogs are simply more prone to adverse reactions. This factor makes it difficult to predict exact recovery times.

All these factors combine to determine the actual recovery time for a dog. It is why professional veterinary assessment is always necessary. They help manage the recovery period safely and effectively. Knowing the signs of various ingestions can also be helpful. For example, knowing [how long does it take for a dog to show signs of onion poisoning](https://beacleaner.com/how-long-does-it-take-for-a-dog-to-show-signs-of-onion-poisoning) can prepare you for other common household dangers.

## The Recovery Process: What to Expect When a Dog Is High

The recovery process for a dog that has ingested THC requires patience and close monitoring. Once your dog is at the veterinary clinic, the medical team will provide supportive care. This care focuses on managing symptoms and helping the body eliminate the toxin. Understanding what to expect during this period can ease your worries.

### Initial Veterinary Treatment

Upon arrival at the vet, the first step is typically a thorough examination. The vet assesses your dog's vital signs and neurological status. If the ingestion was recent (within an hour or two) and your dog is stable, the vet might induce vomiting. This gets rid of undigested THC. Activated charcoal is also common. It absorbs any remaining toxins in the digestive tract. This helps prevent further absorption into the bloodstream.

For more severe cases or delayed presentation, vomiting is not induced. Instead, supportive care becomes the main focus. This includes intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration and help flush the system. Dogs might receive medications to control tremors, seizures, or extreme agitation. They get warm blankets to maintain body temperature if they are too cold. The vet creates a calm, quiet environment for the dog. This reduces stress and aids recovery.

### Monitoring and Observation

Your dog will remain under close supervision at the clinic. Vet staff constantly monitor heart rate, breathing, temperature, and neurological responses. They check for any changes in symptoms. This continuous monitoring is important. It allows for quick adjustments to treatment if the dog's condition changes. For instance, if your dog's heart rate drops too low, they can give medication. Many vets may keep dogs overnight for observation. This ensures they are stable and recovering well before going home.

### At-Home Care During Recovery

Once your vet says your dog can go home, home care is essential. Your dog will likely still be groggy or disoriented for some time. Provide a quiet, comfortable, and safe space for them to rest. Limit stimulation from loud noises or bright lights. Offer fresh water often. Give small, bland meals as directed by your vet. Your vet might prescribe oral medications to help with nausea or anxiety.

Keep a close eye on your dog's progress. Note any lingering symptoms or new concerns. Follow all instructions given by your vet regarding medication and activity levels. Avoid letting your dog climb stairs or jump on furniture until their coordination is fully back. Remember, recovery is a gradual process. Some dogs might take a little longer to return to their normal selves. Your patience and consistent care are key to their full recovery.

## Preventing Accidental Cannabis Ingestion in Dogs

Preventing your dog from getting high is always better than treating the condition. Accidental cannabis ingestion is common, but it is also preventable. Implementing simple safety measures can protect your furry friend.

### Secure Storage of Cannabis Products

The most effective prevention method is secure storage. Treat cannabis products, whether for medical or recreational use, like any other dangerous substance. Store them in high, locked cabinets or containers. Child-proof containers are a good start. However, some dogs can chew through plastic. Consider sturdy, airtight containers made of metal or thick glass. Keep all forms of cannabis, including dried flower, edibles, oils, tinctures, and vape cartridges, out of reach. Remember that edibles are very appealing to dogs due to their sweet taste and strong smell.

### Awareness of Surroundings

Be extra vigilant when you are out with your dog. Dogs often sniff out discarded items on walks. Keep your dog on a leash in areas where cannabis might be present. This allows you to control what they pick up. Do not let your dog eat anything off the ground. Pay attention to what your dog is smelling or trying to mouth. A quick pull on the leash can prevent an ingestion incident.

### Educate Family and Guests

Make sure everyone in your household understands the risks of cannabis to dogs. Tell guests to keep their cannabis products secure when they visit. They should not leave items like edibles on coffee tables or in open bags. It is important for them to understand that even a small amount can harm your dog. Communication and clear boundaries protect your pet. Many people do not realize how dangerous cannabis is for dogs. They need this information to help keep your pet safe.

### Disposing of Cannabis Waste Properly

Proper disposal of cannabis waste is also important. Do not just throw discarded joints or edible wrappers into an open trash can. Dogs can easily access these. Double-bag or place waste in secure outdoor bins that dogs cannot open. Consider flushing small amounts of plant material if local regulations allow. This ensures your dog cannot find it later. These simple steps make a big difference. They ensure your dog stays safe and healthy.

## Long-Term Outlook and Follow-Up Care After THC Exposure

After your dog recovers from a cannabis ingestion incident, you might wonder about the long-term outlook. Most dogs make a full recovery without lasting effects. However, follow-up care and observation remain important. This ensures your dog returns to normal and stays healthy.

### Full Recovery Without Lingering Effects

For the vast majority of dogs, THC toxicity is a temporary condition. Once the THC has cleared their system, they typically return to their baseline health. There are usually no lingering behavioral changes or health problems. The brain and body recover fully from the acute effects. This is especially true if the dog received prompt veterinary care. Early intervention helps mitigate severe symptoms and potential complications.

### Rare Complications and When to Seek Further Help

While rare, some complications can occur. If a dog had severe symptoms like prolonged seizures or a very high dose, very subtle neurological issues might theoretically persist. However, definitive long-term damage is not typical. If you notice any unusual changes in behavior, appetite, or activity level days or weeks after recovery, contact your vet. These could be unrelated issues or very rare, prolonged effects. It is always best to rule out any concerns with a professional.

### Importance of Follow-Up Veterinary Visits

Your veterinarian might recommend a follow-up visit. This visit allows them to assess your dog's full recovery. They check vital signs and conduct a physical exam. This helps ensure there are no hidden issues. It also gives you a chance to discuss any concerns you might have. Use this opportunity to ask questions about prevention and future safety. These visits help confirm that your dog is completely back to normal.

My own experience showed me that even after a scare, dogs bounce back. After my dog's incident, I watched him closely. Within a couple of days, he was his usual playful self. The follow-up call with the vet confirmed his good health. This peace of mind is invaluable.

### Continued Prevention

The best long-term outlook involves continued vigilance. Reinforce all prevention strategies discussed earlier. Keep all cannabis products securely stored. Educate everyone in your home about pet safety. This helps prevent future accidental ingestions. A one-time incident serves as a strong reminder to be extra careful. Your dog relies on you for their safety and well-being. Consistent prevention efforts help ensure a healthy future.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Dogs and Marijuana Exposure

### Can dogs die from being high?

While rare, it is possible for a dog to die from severe marijuana intoxication, especially from large doses or highly concentrated products like edibles. Most deaths occur from complications like respiratory depression, low body temperature, or aspiration pneumonia (inhaling vomit). Prompt veterinary care greatly reduces this risk and improves prognosis. Always seek immediate help.

### What kind of cannabis is most dangerous for dogs?

Edibles are generally the most dangerous for dogs. They often contain high concentrations of THC and other potentially toxic ingredients like chocolate or xylitol. Oils, tinctures, and concentrates also pose a significant risk due to their potency. Raw plant material is less potent but still harmful.

### How can I make my dog more comfortable while high?

If your dog is high, after contacting your vet, provide a quiet, dark, and safe space. Keep them warm and comfortable. Offer water. Do not try to force them to eat or move. Speak calmly and reassuringly. Follow all specific instructions from your veterinarian. Your vet may advise hospitalization for close monitoring.

### Should I induce vomiting if my dog ate marijuana?

Do not induce vomiting at home without direct veterinary instruction. Inducing vomiting can be dangerous if your dog is already sedated, uncoordinated, or having seizures. They could inhale their vomit, leading to aspiration pneumonia. Your vet will determine if inducing vomiting is safe and necessary.

### Are there long-term effects of a dog being high?

Most dogs experience a full recovery from marijuana intoxication with no long-term effects. Lingering neurological issues are very rare and typically only occur in the most severe, untreated cases. With proper veterinary care, dogs usually return to their normal health and behavior within days.

### Does CBD affect dogs the same way as THC?

No, CBD does not affect dogs the same way as THC. CBD (cannabidiol) is non-psychoactive and does not cause the "high" associated with THC. While some CBD products may contain trace amounts of THC, they generally do not lead to intoxication symptoms. CBD is often used for its potential therapeutic benefits in dogs.

## Conclusion

Understanding **how long it takes for a dog to recover from being high** is a critical aspect of pet safety and responsible ownership. While the exact recovery time can vary, typically from 24 to 72 hours, immediate veterinary care significantly improves your dog's prognosis and comfort. Recognize the signs of THC toxicity quickly. Act fast by contacting your veterinarian without delay.

My advice comes from a desire to help other pet owners. I know the worry a pet emergency brings.
