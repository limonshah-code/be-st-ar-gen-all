For the ports, use a dry, soft brush. A clean, new toothbrush works well. Gently brush around the openings of the USB-C ports, headphone jack, and any other ports. This dislodges dust and lint.

### Common Cleaning Mistakes to Avoid

When cleaning your MacBook Air, some mistakes can cause damage. We want to protect your valuable device. Knowing what not to do is as important as knowing what to do. Always read these tips before you start cleaning.

First, never spray liquids directly onto your MacBook Air. This includes water, alcohol, or cleaning solutions. Liquid can seep into tiny openings. It can damage internal electronic components. Always apply any liquid to your cleaning cloth first. Then, use the damp cloth to wipe the surface. The cloth should only be damp, not wet.

Second, do not use harsh chemicals. Avoid window cleaners, abrasive cleaners, or bleach. These chemicals can strip protective coatings from your screen. They can discolor the aluminum casing. They can also damage the keycaps. Stick to distilled water or a gentle 70% isopropyl alcohol solution. These are safe for most surfaces.

Third, avoid using rough materials. Paper towels, rough cloths, or sponges can scratch your screen. They can also scratch the aluminum body. Always use clean, soft microfiber cloths. They are designed for delicate surfaces. Make sure your cloths are free of dirt or grit. Even small particles can cause scratches.

Fourth, do not press too hard. Whether cleaning the screen or the keyboard, gentle pressure is key. Hard pressure can damage pixels on the screen. It can also cause keys to break or become dislodged. Let the cloth and cleaning solution do the work. Use light, even strokes.

Fifth, do not use very cold compressed air. Hold the can upright. Spray in short bursts. If you tilt the can too much, liquid propellant might come out. This liquid is very cold. It can damage plastic parts or internal components. It can also leave residue. Always read the instructions on your compressed air can. Following these warnings helps keep your MacBook Air safe.

*   Do not spray liquid directly onto the MacBook Air.
