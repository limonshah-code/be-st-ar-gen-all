## How To Clean Sperry Top Sider Boat Shoes for Lasting Style

Sperry Top-Sider boat shoes are a classic footwear choice. They offer comfort and style, perfect for a day on the deck or a casual outing. Over time, however, these beloved shoes collect dirt, salt, and various stains. Keeping them clean ensures they last longer and look great. You want your favorite pair of Sperrys to reflect your clean style, not accumulated grime.

Cleaning your Sperry Top Sider boat shoes is simpler than you might think. This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions. We will cover cleaning different materials like leather, canvas, and suede. You will also learn how to tackle common stains and keep your Sperrys looking fresh. Get ready to revitalize your favorite pair!

### Takeaway

Keeping your Sperry boat shoes pristine requires specific care based on their material.
*   **Leather:** Use a mild soap, soft brush, and leather conditioner. Avoid harsh chemicals.
*   **Canvas:** Machine wash on a gentle cycle or hand wash with detergent. Air dry away from direct heat.
*   **Suede:** Use a suede brush and eraser. Avoid water and liquid cleaners.

To effectively clean Sperry Top Sider boat shoes, identify the material (leather, canvas, suede). Use mild soap and a soft brush for leather, gently scrubbing and conditioning afterward. For canvas, a gentle machine wash or hand wash with detergent works best. Suede requires a special brush and eraser to remove dirt without water.

### Understanding Your Sperry Materials: Leather, Canvas, and Suede

Before you start cleaning, you must know what your Sperry shoes are made of. Sperry Top-Siders come in several materials. Each material needs a different cleaning method. Using the wrong product or technique can damage your shoes.

**Leather Sperrys:**
Most classic Sperry boat shoes are made from full-grain or tumbled leather. This leather is durable but needs gentle care. Leather can crack or dry out if not cleaned correctly. It can also stain easily. You should treat leather with products designed for it.

**Canvas Sperrys:**
Many Sperry styles use canvas fabric. Canvas is a sturdy cotton material. It is often more forgiving than leather regarding water and mild detergents. Canvas can, however, absorb stains deeply. It also shows dirt more readily.

**Suede Sperrys:**
Some Sperry Top-Siders feature suede elements or are entirely made of suede. Suede is a delicate material with a napped finish. Water can easily damage suede, leaving permanent spots. It requires specialized cleaning tools.

**Other Materials:**
Sperry also uses synthetic materials, nubuck, or combinations. Always check your shoe's specific material. You can often find this information on the shoe's tag or the original packaging. Knowing the material helps you choose the right cleaning approach.

### Essential Cleaning Supplies for Sperry Shoes

Having the right tools makes cleaning your Sperry boat shoes much easier. You do not need many specialized items. Most supplies are common household goods or easily found online. Gather everything before you begin.

**For All Materials:**
First, you will need a soft-bristled brush. An old toothbrush works well for small areas. A microfibre cloth is also useful for wiping and drying. Make sure you have clean, fresh water. Access to running water is good, like a sink or hose.

**For Leather Sperrys:**
You need a mild soap. This can be dish soap or a dedicated leather cleaner. Look for a pH-neutral cleaner. A leather conditioner is also vital to keep the leather soft. This prevents drying and cracking after cleaning. You might want a leather protector spray for future defense.

**For Canvas Sperrys:**
A gentle laundry detergent is perfect for canvas. You can use liquid or powder. A stain remover designed for fabric can help with tough spots. A bucket or basin is useful for soaking. You might consider a mesh laundry bag if machine washing.

**For Suede Sperrys:**
A special suede brush is necessary. This brush helps lift dirt and restore the nap. A suede eraser also removes marks. If you have deep stains, a suede cleaner spray might be needed. Always avoid water when cleaning suede.

**Optional Supplies:**
Consider shoe trees to help your shoes keep their shape during drying. Baking soda or odor balls can help with smells. A protective spray can add a layer of defense after cleaning. Having these items ready saves time. You can find more general shoe cleaning tips here: [How To Clean Shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes).

### Step-by-Step Guide: Cleaning Leather Sperry Boat Shoes

Cleaning leather Sperry Top Siders requires a gentle touch and specific products. This method protects the leather's quality and appearance. Do not rush this process. My own leather Sperrys have lasted years with this care.

**1. Prepare Your Shoes:**
First, remove the laces and insoles from your shoes. Shake out any loose dirt or debris from inside the shoes. Use a dry, soft brush to remove surface dirt from the leather. Pay attention to the stitching and seams where dirt collects.

**2. Create a Cleaning Solution:**
Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water in a bowl. Use about one teaspoon of soap per cup of water. You want a very diluted solution. For a dedicated clean, consider a specialized leather cleaner instead.

**3. Gently Clean the Leather:**
Dip a soft cloth or sponge into the soapy water. Wring it out well so it is damp, not wet. Gently wipe down the leather surfaces of the shoe. Do not saturate the leather with water. For tougher spots, use a soft-bristled brush (like an old toothbrush) to scrub lightly. Work in small sections.

**4. Wipe Away Soap Residue:**
Dip a clean cloth in plain water and wring it out completely. Wipe down the shoes again to remove any soap residue. Make sure no soapy film remains. Residue can attract more dirt or dry out the leather.

**5. Clean the Soles and Laces:**
Use the same soapy solution and a scrub brush to clean the rubber soles. Get into the grooves for good traction. Hand wash the laces separately with soap and water. Rinse them thoroughly.

**6. Dry and Condition the Leather:**
Pat the shoes dry with a clean microfibre towel. Allow them to air dry completely at room temperature, away from direct sunlight or heat. Direct heat can dry and crack leather. Once dry, apply a small amount of leather conditioner with a clean cloth. Rub it into the leather in circular motions. This restores moisture and softness.

### How to Clean Canvas Sperry Top Siders

Canvas Sperry shoes are generally easier to clean than their leather counterparts. You have options for hand washing or even machine washing. I often choose machine washing for my canvas Sperrys when they are very dirty.

**1. Prepare Your Canvas Shoes:**
Remove the laces and insoles from your Sperry canvas shoes. Shake out any loose dirt or sand from inside. Use a dry brush to remove as much surface dirt as possible. This prevents dirt from spreading during washing.

**2. Pre-Treat Stains (Optional):**
For stubborn stains, apply a small amount of laundry stain remover directly to the spot. Let it sit for a few minutes. Always test the stain remover on an inconspicuous area first. This ensures it does not discolor the canvas.

**3. Choose Your Washing Method:**

*   **Hand Washing:**
    *   Fill a basin or bucket with cool or lukewarm water.
    *   Add a small amount of mild liquid laundry detergent.
    *   Submerge the shoes and scrub them with a soft brush. Focus on dirty areas.
    *   Rinse the shoes thoroughly under cool, running water until all soap is gone.
    *   Wring out excess water gently.

*   **Machine Washing:**
    *   Place the shoes (and laces) in a mesh laundry bag. This protects them and your washing machine.
    *   Add a small amount of mild laundry detergent to your washing machine.
    *   Wash on a gentle cycle with cold water. Avoid hot water, which can shrink or fade canvas.
    *   Do not wash with other clothes, especially light-colored ones, as some canvas dyes may bleed. Learn more about machine washing shoes here: [How To Clean Shoes In The Washer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer).

**4. Clean the Soles and Laces:**
Regardless of the canvas cleaning method, use a brush and soapy water to scrub the rubber soles. This gets rid of ground-in dirt. Hand wash the laces separately if you did not machine wash them in a bag.

**5. Air Dry Completely:**
Stuff the shoes with paper towels or old newspapers to help absorb moisture and maintain their shape. Change the paper every few hours. Place the shoes in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or heat. Sunlight can fade canvas, and heat can damage the glue. Allow them to dry completely, which can take 24-48 hours.

### Special Care for Suede Sperry Boat Shoes

Suede is a delicate material that requires a different cleaning approach. Water can easily damage suede, so avoid liquid cleaners unless specified for suede. My suede shoes always get dry treatment first.

**1. Dry Cleaning First:**
Start by letting any wet mud or dirt dry completely. Once dry, use a soft suede brush to gently brush away loose dirt and dust. Always brush in one direction to maintain the suede's nap. If you brush back and forth, you can flatten or damage the fibers.

**2. Remove Scuffs and Marks:**
For scuffs, shiny spots, or embedded dirt, use a suede eraser. Gently rub the eraser over the affected areas. This works much like a pencil eraser, lifting the marks. For stubborn spots, you might need to apply a bit more pressure.

**3. Address Deeper Stains (If Necessary):**
If you have oil or grease stains, you can try applying cornstarch or talcum powder. Let it sit for several hours or overnight to absorb the oil. Then, brush it off with your suede brush. For liquid stains that have already dried, a specialized suede cleaner spray might be needed. Always test in an inconspicuous area first. Follow the product instructions carefully.

**4. Restore the Nap:**
After cleaning, use the suede brush to restore the material's original texture. Brush consistently in one direction. This lifts the fibers and makes the suede look uniform again.

**5. Air Dry (If Any Moisture Was Used):**
If you had to use a spray cleaner, allow the shoes to air dry completely. Keep them away from direct heat or sunlight. Stuff them with paper to absorb internal moisture.

**6. Protect Your Suede:**
Once clean and dry, apply a good quality suede protector spray. This creates a barrier against water and stains. Reapply regularly as per product instructions. This helps prevent future damage.

### Tackling Common Stains on Sperry Shoes

Sperry boat shoes are often exposed to challenging environments. This means they can pick up various stains. Different stains require different removal techniques. I have dealt with many of these myself.

**1. Mold and Mildew:**
Mold is a common issue for shoes stored in damp places. For leather, mix equal parts water and rubbing alcohol. Dab it on the mold with a cloth. For canvas, use a solution of white vinegar and water (1:1 ratio) or a diluted bleach solution (1 part bleach to 10 parts water) for white canvas. Scrub with a brush. Rinse thoroughly and air dry. For suede, never use liquid; brush off dry mold, or if it persists, professional cleaning might be needed. More general advice on mold on shoes is here: [How To Clean Mold Off Shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-mold-off-shoes).

**2. Saltwater Stains:**
Saltwater can leave white, crusty marks on leather and canvas. For leather, wipe the area with a damp cloth dipped in plain water. Then apply leather conditioner once dry. For canvas, soak the affected area in plain water and gently scrub with a brush. Rinse well. Air dry.

**3. Scuffs and Abrasions:**
On leather, minor scuffs can often be buffed out with a clean, soft cloth. A small amount of leather conditioner can help. For deeper scuffs on white leather or rubber soles, a magic eraser can work wonders. Rub gently. For suede, use a suede eraser as mentioned previously.

**4. Oil and Grease Stains:**
These are tricky. For leather, blot the stain immediately with a dry cloth. Apply a small amount of cornstarch or talcum powder. Let it sit for several hours to absorb the oil, then brush it off. Repeat if necessary. For canvas, pre-treat with a grease-cutting dish soap before washing. For suede, also use cornstarch or a specialized suede degreaser.

**5. General Dirt and Grime:**
For all materials, consistent regular cleaning prevents dirt from setting in. Use a dry brush to remove loose dirt daily. Wipe leather and canvas with a damp cloth after wear. This proactive approach saves deep cleaning time.

### Drying and Conditioning Your Sperry Boat Shoes

Proper drying is as important as cleaning. Incorrect drying can warp your shoes. It can also cause cracking in leather or mildew growth in canvas. Conditioning leather helps keep it supple.

**1. Air Drying is Key:**
Always air dry your Sperry boat shoes. Never use direct heat sources like hair dryers, radiators, or direct sunlight. High heat can shrink canvas, crack leather, and damage the glues that hold the shoes together. It can also cause discoloration. Find a well-ventilated area indoors or in a shaded spot outdoors.

**2. Maintain Shape with Stuffing:**
As your shoes dry, they can lose their shape. Stuff them firmly with paper towels or old newspapers. This helps absorb internal moisture and maintains the shoe's original form. Change the paper every few hours, especially in the first few hours, as it becomes damp. Shoe trees are also excellent for this purpose if you have them.

**3. Allow Ample Drying Time:**
Drying times vary based on humidity and material. Leather shoes can take 24-48 hours to dry completely. Canvas shoes might dry a bit faster. Ensure they are completely dry before wearing them again or storing them. Damp shoes are a breeding ground for odors and mold.

**4. Condition Leather After Drying:**
Once your leather Sperrys are thoroughly dry, apply a good quality leather conditioner. Dispense a small amount onto a clean, soft cloth. Rub the conditioner into the leather in small circular motions. This step replenishes the natural oils in the leather. It prevents the leather from drying out, cracking, and looking dull. Buff off any excess. This also enhances the shoe's natural luster.

**5. Protect Your Shoes (Optional but Recommended):**
After drying and conditioning, consider applying a water and stain protector spray. Use a product specific to your shoe's material (leather, canvas, or suede). This adds an invisible barrier that repels water and makes future cleaning easier. Always follow the product instructions for application and reapplication frequency.

### Maintaining Your Sperrys: Prevention Tips

Prevention is the best approach for keeping your Sperry Top Sider boat shoes in top condition. Simple habits extend their life. I always apply these tips to my favorite pairs.

**1. Regular Brushing:**
After each wear, give your shoes a quick brush with a soft brush. This removes loose dirt, dust, and debris before it can set in. For suede, this also helps maintain the nap. This simple step reduces the need for deep cleaning.

**2. Rotate Your Shoes:**
Do not wear the same pair of Sperrys every single day. Give them a day or two to air out between wears. This allows moisture to evaporate fully and prevents odors. Having multiple pairs extends the life of each.

**3. Use Shoe Trees or Stuffing:**
When not wearing your shoes, insert shoe trees. Cedar shoe trees are ideal as they absorb moisture and odors. If you do not have shoe trees, stuff your shoes with crumpled newspaper. This helps them retain their shape and absorb internal dampness.

**4. Apply Protective Sprays:**
Invest in a good quality water and stain repellent spray. Apply it to new shoes before the first wear. Reapply every few months, or as directed by the product. This creates a protective barrier against spills and elements. Make sure the spray is appropriate for your shoe's material.

**5. Clean Laces and Insoles Separately:**
The laces and insoles absorb a lot of dirt and sweat. Remove and clean them periodically. You can hand wash laces or machine wash them in a mesh bag. Insoles can be scrubbed with soap and water or replaced if very worn. Learning how to clean the inside of shoes is crucial for freshness: [How To Clean The Inside Of Shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes).

**6. Proper Storage:**
Store your Sperrys in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Avoid damp basements or hot attics. If storing for a long time, clean them thoroughly first. Stuff them, and place them in a breathable bag or box. This protects them from dust and humidity.

**7. Immediate Stain Treatment:**
Act fast when spills or stains occur. The quicker you address a stain, the easier it is to remove. Blot liquids immediately. Scrape off solids before they dry. Then, follow the appropriate cleaning steps for the specific stain and material.

### FAQ Section

**Q: Can you put Sperry boat shoes in the washing machine?**
A: You can machine wash canvas Sperry shoes on a gentle, cold cycle in a mesh bag with mild detergent. Do not machine wash leather or suede Sperrys, as this can cause severe damage. Always air dry thoroughly afterward.

**Q: How often should I clean my Sperry shoes?**
A: It depends on how often you wear them and what activities you do. For light wear, a quick brush after each use and a deeper clean every few weeks is sufficient. If worn regularly in dirty environments, clean them more frequently, especially once stains or dirt become noticeable.

**Q: What if my Sperrys smell bad?**
A: Odor often comes from moisture and bacteria inside the shoe. Remove insoles and let shoes air out completely. Sprinkle baking soda inside and let it sit overnight. You can also use shoe deodorizers or cedar shoe trees. Ensure the insides are fully dry after cleaning.

**Q: Can I use household cleaners like bleach or strong detergents?**
A: Avoid strong household cleaners, especially on leather and suede, as they can cause discoloration, drying, or damage. For canvas, a very diluted bleach solution can be used for white shoes, but test it first. Always opt for mild, pH-neutral soaps or specific shoe cleaning products.

**Q: How do I protect my Sperrys from future stains and water damage?**
A: After cleaning and drying, apply a waterproof and stain-repellent spray. Choose a product suitable for your shoe's material (leather, canvas, or suede). Reapply regularly according to the product's instructions. This creates a protective barrier that helps repel liquids and makes future cleaning easier.

**Q: My leather Sperrys feel stiff after cleaning. What should I do?**
A: This usually means the leather has lost some moisture. After cleaning and ensuring they are fully dry, apply a generous amount of good quality leather conditioner. Rub it in well, allow it to absorb, and then buff off any excess. This will help restore the leather's natural suppleness and softness.
