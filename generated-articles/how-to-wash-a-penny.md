## Discover How To Wash A Penny for a Brilliant Shine

Do you have a jar full of dull, dark pennies? Many people wonder how to wash a penny to bring back its original shine. Pennies often lose their luster over time, becoming discolored and dirty. This happens because of a chemical reaction with the air around them.

Cleaning these small coins might seem like a small task, but it offers a fun and educational way to understand basic chemistry. Knowing how to wash a penny correctly helps restore its appearance. It also teaches you about copper oxidation and safe cleaning practices. This guide will walk you through easy methods to clean your pennies using common household items. I will explain why pennies get dirty and share simple steps to make them bright again. We will cover safe cleaning, alternative methods, and important tips for preservation. Let us make those old coins gleam once more.

### Takeaway

*   Use common household items like vinegar, salt, or lemon juice to clean pennies.
*   Avoid abrasive materials that can scratch the coin's surface.
*   Understand the penny's material to choose the best cleaning method.
*   Clean pennies mostly for aesthetic appeal or scientific observation, not for monetary value increase.

### The Quick Answer: How to Wash A Penny

You can wash a penny using a simple mixture of white vinegar and salt. Submerge the penny in this solution for a few minutes. The acid in the vinegar reacts with the copper oxide, dissolving the tarnish. After soaking, gently rub the penny and rinse it with water. Then, dry it completely to prevent new tarnish.

## Why Your Pennies Need a Wash: Understanding Tarnish

You might notice your shiny new pennies quickly become dull. This change is tarnish. Tarnish is a thin layer of corrosion that forms on the surface of metals. For pennies, which are mostly copper, this happens through a process called oxidation.

Copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction creates copper oxide, a dark, brownish-black compound. Moisture and other chemicals in the environment can speed up this process. The dirtier the environment, the faster a penny tarnishes. Understanding this process helps us choose the right cleaning agents. Acids, like those in vinegar or lemon juice, can reverse this oxidation. They react with the copper oxide, turning it back into soluble copper salts. These salts then wash away, leaving the bright copper underneath exposed.

Old pennies, especially those minted before 1982, are made of 95% copper. These coins tarnish more noticeably. Pennies minted after 1982 have a zinc core with a thin copper plating. While they still tarnish, the cleaning process needs extra care to protect the thin copper layer. Knowing the penny's composition is key to safe cleaning. This knowledge helps you avoid damaging the coin's surface. The goal is to clean without causing harm.

## Essential Supplies for Washing Pennies

To effectively wash a penny, you do not need special tools. Many common household items work well. These items are safe and easy to find. Having the right supplies ready makes the cleaning process smooth.

First, you will need a small, non-metal bowl. Glass or plastic bowls are ideal. Avoid metal bowls, as they can react with the cleaning solutions. Next, gather your primary cleaning agents. White vinegar is a popular choice. Its mild acidity helps dissolve tarnish. Table salt acts as an abrasive and speeds up the chemical reaction. Lemon juice is another acidic option, working similarly to vinegar. For alternative methods, you might use ketchup or baking soda. Ketchup contains vinegar, and baking soda forms a mild abrasive paste.

You will also need some tools for scrubbing and rinsing. A soft toothbrush or a cotton swab works well for gentle scrubbing. Microfiber cloths or paper towels are great for drying. Always have a source of clean water for rinsing. This removes the cleaning solution and any loosened tarnish. Remember to protect your hands with gloves if you have sensitive skin. These basic items are all you need to start making your pennies shine.

*   Small, non-metal bowl (glass or plastic)
*   White vinegar
*   Table salt
*   Soft toothbrush or cotton swabs
*   Microfiber cloth or paper towels
*   Clean water for rinsing
*   Optional: lemon juice, ketchup, baking soda, gloves

## Step-by-Step: The Classic Vinegar and Salt Penny Wash

The vinegar and salt method is a time-tested way to wash a penny. It is simple, effective, and uses common kitchen ingredients. This method relies on the acidic properties of vinegar combined with the abrasive action of salt.

First, gather your materials: a non-metal bowl, white vinegar, table salt, a soft brush, and clean water. Pour about half a cup of white vinegar into the bowl. Add a tablespoon of table salt to the vinegar. Stir the mixture gently until the salt mostly dissolves. This creates your cleaning solution. Place your tarnished pennies into the solution. Make sure the pennies are fully submerged. You should see bubbles forming around the coins almost immediately. This is a sign the chemical reaction is happening. Let the pennies soak for about five to ten minutes. For very dirty pennies, you might extend the soaking time slightly. However, avoid leaving them for too long, especially newer pennies, as the acid can start to etch the zinc core.

Once the soaking time is up, remove the pennies one by one. Use a soft toothbrush or cotton swab to gently scrub away any remaining tarnish. You will notice the dark layer rubbing off easily. After scrubbing, rinse each penny thoroughly under clean running water. This removes all traces of the vinegar and salt mixture. Failing to rinse properly can lead to new tarnish forming quickly. Finally, dry the pennies completely with a soft cloth or paper towel. Ensure no moisture remains to prevent re-tarnishing. This simple process can transform dull pennies into bright, shiny coins.

## Exploring Other Effective Penny Washing Methods

While vinegar and salt are excellent for washing pennies, other household items also work well. These alternative methods offer flexibility and can be effective depending on what you have available. They also provide different approaches to dissolving copper tarnish.

### Using Lemon Juice and Salt

Lemon juice is another natural acid that cleans pennies effectively. Its citric acid works similarly to vinegar. To use this method, squeeze fresh lemon juice into a non-metal bowl. Add a pinch of salt to the lemon juice. Stir to dissolve the salt. Place your pennies into the mixture and let them soak for a few minutes. As with vinegar, observe the reaction and look for the tarnish loosening. Remove the pennies, scrub gently with a soft brush, and rinse thoroughly with clean water. Dry them immediately. This method leaves pennies with a fresh, citrus scent.

### The Ketchup Method

Ketchup might seem like an unusual cleaner, but it contains vinegar, which is key. The consistency of ketchup also helps it cling to the penny's surface. To try this, simply squirt a small amount of ketchup onto a paper towel. Place a tarnished penny on the ketchup. Rub the penny with the ketchup, ensuring it covers the entire surface. You can also let the penny sit in a dollop of ketchup for 10-15 minutes. The mild acid in the ketchup will slowly break down the tarnish. After the designated time, scrub the penny with a soft brush and rinse well under running water. This method is great for spot cleaning or for those who prefer a less liquid approach.

### Baking Soda Paste for Gentle Cleaning

Baking soda offers a gentler, slightly abrasive cleaning option. It forms a mild paste that can scrub away tarnish without harsh chemicals. To use baking soda, mix a small amount of baking soda with just enough water to form a thick paste. Apply this paste directly onto the tarnished penny. Use your fingers or a soft cloth to gently rub the paste over the coin's surface. The abrasive action of the baking soda helps lift the tarnish. This method is often less aggressive than acid baths. After scrubbing, rinse the penny completely under water. Then dry it thoroughly. This technique is suitable for lightly tarnished pennies or for those worried about strong acids.

## Washing Pennies Safely: Tips to Avoid Damage

While cleaning pennies can be satisfying, it is crucial to do it safely. Improper cleaning can damage the coin. This is especially true for older or collectible pennies. Understanding the risks helps you protect your coins.

First, identify the penny's material. Pennies made before 1982 are solid copper. They can withstand stronger acidic solutions. Pennies made after 1982 are mostly zinc with a thin copper plating. The acid can quickly corrode the zinc core if the plating is scratched or compromised. For these newer pennies, use shorter soaking times. Use gentler cleaning solutions. Always avoid harsh abrasives. Steel wool or strong scouring pads will scratch the surface. They can remove the thin copper layer. Use only soft brushes, cotton swabs, or cloths for scrubbing.

Consider the coin's value. If you suspect a penny has numismatic value, do not clean it. Cleaning can significantly reduce a coin's collector value. Collectors prefer coins in their original condition, even if tarnished. The tarnish, also known as patina, can protect the coin and is part of its history. Cleaning a valuable coin means removing its historical layers. This makes it less desirable to serious collectors. If you are unsure, consult a coin expert before cleaning. Only clean pennies for their aesthetic appeal. Never clean them to increase monetary worth. When handling any currency, understanding proper care can extend its life.

This article, while about a different subject, emphasizes careful cleaning techniques relevant to maintaining surfaces.

Always rinse pennies thoroughly after cleaning. Any leftover acid or cleaning agent can continue to react with the copper. This can lead to new, uneven tarnish or even damage over time. Dry pennies immediately and completely. Moisture encourages re-tarnishing. Use a soft, absorbent cloth. Store cleaned pennies in a dry, airtight container. This helps prevent exposure to oxygen and moisture. Preventing tarnish is easier than removing it again.

## Drying and Storing Your Clean Pennies

After you wash a penny, proper drying and storage are just as important as the cleaning process itself. If you do not dry pennies completely, they will re-tarnish quickly. Moisture is a catalyst for oxidation, which creates tarnish.

First, immediately after rinsing, place your pennies on a soft, clean, absorbent cloth or paper towel. Do not let them air dry, as water spots can form. Gently pat each penny dry. You can also carefully rub them with the cloth to ensure all moisture is gone. If you have many pennies, lay them out in a single layer. Use a second dry cloth to absorb any remaining water. Make sure the surface is completely dry before moving to storage. Even a small amount of moisture can trigger new tarnish formation.

Once dry, store your clean pennies correctly to maintain their shine. The best way to store them is in an airtight container. This minimizes exposure to oxygen and humidity. Coin flips made of Mylar are a good option. Small, sealable plastic bags can also work. Avoid storing them in direct sunlight or in areas with high humidity, like bathrooms. You can also add a small packet of silica gel to the container. Silica gel absorbs moisture. This further protects the pennies from re-tarnishing. Proper drying and storage help your freshly cleaned pennies stay shiny for a longer time.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Washing Pennies
