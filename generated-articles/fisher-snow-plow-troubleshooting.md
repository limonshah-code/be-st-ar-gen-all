### What is the most common issue with Fisher snow plows?

The most common issues with Fisher snow plows often involve electrical system failures or hydraulic fluid problems. These can lead to the plow not lifting, lowering, or angling correctly. Controller malfunctions and wiring faults also appear frequently, stopping proper plow operation.

### Starting with Fisher Plow Troubleshooting Basics

When your Fisher snow plow acts up, start with simple steps. Do not jump to complex solutions. A basic check saves time. It also prevents you from replacing parts you do not need. Your safety is most important. Always follow safety rules when you work on your plow.

First, make sure your vehicle is off. Set the parking brake. Block your wheels. This prevents accidental movement. Disconnect the plow power. Take off the main power cable from the battery. This stops electrical current. You stay safe this way.

Next, look at your plow system. Do you see any obvious damage? Check all cables. Look at hoses. See if anything is loose or cut. Sometimes, a simple loose wire causes a big problem. A quick visual inspection can show many issues. This simple start prevents more serious trouble.

*   **Safety First Checks:**
    *   Turn off the vehicle engine.
    *   Engage the parking brake.
    *   Place blocks under your vehicle's wheels.
    *   Disconnect the main power wire from your vehicle battery. This removes power to the plow.

*   **Visual Inspection Steps:**
    *   Examine all electrical wires for cuts or fraying.
    *   Look at all hydraulic hoses for leaks or kinks.
    *   Check mounting bolts. Make sure they are tight.
    *   Inspect the plow frame. Look for bends or breaks.
    *   Ensure all pins are in place.

Checking these basic things helps you find easy fixes. It also gives you a safe starting point for deeper troubleshooting. Remember, many plow problems have simple causes.

### Solving Fisher Plow Electrical Problems

Electrical problems are common with snow plows. A Fisher plow needs good power to work. Issues can range from a dead controller to a plow that does not move. Always start at the power source. This is usually your vehicle's battery. Ensure your battery is strong. It needs to hold a charge.

Test battery voltage with a multimeter. A low battery cannot power the plow. Check all battery connections. They must be clean and tight. Corroded terminals stop power flow. Clean them with a wire brush. Apply anti-corrosion spray. This step is critical.

After the battery, check the main power cable to the plow. This cable runs from the battery to the plow's solenoid. Look for breaks or pinches. Ensure connections at both ends are secure. A damaged cable cannot carry enough current. This stops the plow from working. You might also want to look at general troubleshooting guides for other plow brands for similar electrical issues, such as the [Boss Snow Plow Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/boss-snow-plow-troubleshooting) guide or even the [Meyers Snow Plow Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/meyers-snow-plow-troubleshooting) guide, as many electrical principles are shared.

The solenoid is a key electrical part. It is a large relay. It connects battery power to the plow pump motor. When you press a button on your controller, the solenoid should click. If it does not click, it might be bad. You can test it. Put a multimeter on its terminals. Check for voltage when the controller activates it. A bad solenoid prevents the motor from spinning.

*   **Battery and Connection Checks:**
    *   Test battery voltage; it should be 12.6V or higher.
    *   Clean battery terminals and cable ends.
    *   Tighten all battery connections.
    *   Ensure the main power cable from the battery to the plow is undamaged.

*   **Solenoid and Motor Checks:**
    *   Listen for a click from the solenoid when you press a plow button.
    *   Test for voltage at the solenoid's large terminals. It should be battery voltage when activated.
    *   If the solenoid clicks but the motor does not spin, test the motor directly. You can briefly jump the motor terminals if safe.
    *   Check the ground wire from the motor. A bad ground stops the motor.

Always trace the power path. Power starts at the battery. It goes through cables and the solenoid. It then reaches the motor. Any break in this path causes an electrical fault. Fixing electrical issues often involves cleaning connections or replacing a faulty component like a solenoid or a power cable.

### Addressing Fisher Plow Hydraulic System Malfunctions

Hydraulic issues stop your Fisher plow from moving. The hydraulic system uses fluid pressure. This pressure moves the plow blade. If your plow does not lift, lower, or angle, suspect the hydraulics. First, check the hydraulic fluid level. Low fluid is a common cause of problems. Your plow reservoir has a fill line. The fluid should be at this line.

Use the correct type of hydraulic fluid. Fisher plows often use specific hydraulic fluid. Using the wrong fluid can damage seals and pumps. Refer to your owner's manual for the exact fluid type. Add fluid slowly. Do not overfill the reservoir. Too much fluid causes problems too.

Next, inspect the hydraulic pump. This pump creates the pressure. When you operate the plow, you should hear the pump motor run. If the motor runs but the plow does not move, the pump might be bad. Or, air might be in the system. Air bubbles make the hydraulics spongy. To remove air, cycle the plow through its full range of motion. Do this several times. Lift the blade fully. Angle it left and right. Then lower it.

Hydraulic valves control fluid flow. They direct fluid to different cylinders. Solenoid valves are common. They open and close electronically. If a specific function does not work (e.g., only lifts but does not angle), a valve might be stuck or faulty. You can sometimes hear a faint click from a valve when you activate its function. If you hear no click, the electrical signal to the valve might be missing. Similar hydraulic issues can be found in other plows. For instance, the [Western Plow Troubleshooting Guide](https://beacleaner.com/western-plow-troubleshooting-guide) also covers many hydraulic system diagnostics.

*   **Fluid Level and Type:**
    *   Check hydraulic fluid level in the reservoir.
    *   Ensure the fluid is at the correct mark, usually cold and lowered.
    *   Use only the recommended Fisher hydraulic fluid.
    *   Add fluid slowly if needed, avoiding overfilling.

*   **Pump and System Air:**
    *   Listen for the hydraulic pump motor running.
    *   If the motor runs but no movement occurs, check for air in the system.
    *   Cycle the plow through all movements to bleed air.
    *   If air bleeding fails, the pump may be weak or faulty.

*   **Valve Inspection:**
    *   Identify the specific function that does not work.
    *   Locate the hydraulic valve for that function.
    *   Check for electrical power to the valve solenoid when activated.
    *   If power is present, the valve might be stuck or faulty.
    *   Sometimes, tapping a stuck valve lightly can free it.

Hydraulic leaks also cause low pressure. Look for fluid puddles under the plow. Check all hoses and cylinders for drips. A tiny leak can lead to significant pressure loss over time. Replace any leaky hoses or fittings immediately.

### Diagnosing Fisher Plow Lift and Angle Issues

Specific movement problems indicate specific component faults. If your Fisher plow does not lift, the problem is usually with the lift cylinder or its control valve. If it lifts slowly, the pump might be weak, or the fluid is low. Air in the system can also cause slow movement. Always ensure the system is full of the correct fluid and free of air.

When the plow does not angle left or right, you likely have an issue with the angling cylinders or their control valves. Each angling cylinder has a specific valve. If only one side does not angle, check that specific valve. Test its electrical connection. Ensure power reaches the solenoid. A common issue is a wire breaking or a connector coming loose.

Sometimes the plow drifts. This means it slowly lowers or angles by itself. This often points to internal leaks. Worn cylinder seals can cause this. Fluid bypasses the seals instead of holding pressure. A faulty holding valve can also cause drift. If your plow drifts, a rebuild kit for the cylinders or replacement of a valve might be necessary.

*   **Plow Not Lifting/Lowering:**
    *   Check hydraulic fluid level first.
    *   Listen to the pump motor. Does it sound strong?
    *   Inspect the lift cylinder for external leaks.
    *   Check the lift valve solenoid. Ensure it gets power and clicks.
    *   Cycle the plow to bleed air if movement is slow.

*   **Plow Not Angling:**
    *   Determine if one side or both sides fail to angle.
    *   Check the respective angle cylinder solenoids for power and clicks.
    *   Inspect angle cylinders for external leaks.
    *   Look at the angle hoses for damage or kinks.
    *   Consider a faulty angle valve if electrical checks pass.

*   **Plow Drifting:**
    *   Observe if the plow slowly lowers or angles on its own.
    *   This suggests internal hydraulic leaks.
    *   Cylinder seals might be worn.
    *   A holding valve could be faulty.
    *   Professional diagnosis may be needed for internal leaks.

For these specific movements, troubleshooting often comes down to identifying which hydraulic circuit is failing. Then, you test the components in that circuit. These components include the cylinders, the hoses, and the control valves. Comparing your issues to resources like the [Sno-Way Plow Controller Troubleshooting](https://beacleaner.com/sno-way-plow-controller-troubleshooting) guide could also offer insights, as the basic hydraulic principles are similar across plow brands.

### Troubleshooting Fisher Plow Controller and Wiring

The controller is your direct link to the plow. If your Fisher plow controller does not light up or respond, check its power supply. The controller gets power from the vehicle's electrical system. This power often comes through a dedicated harness. First, check the fuse for the plow harness in your vehicle's fuse box. A blown fuse means no power. Replace it with the correct amperage fuse.

Next, inspect the controller cable. This cable connects the handheld controller to the vehicle harness. Look for cuts or pinches. Ensure the connectors at both ends are clean and secure. Dirt or corrosion in the connectors can stop signals. Sometimes, simply unplugging and re-plugging the controller cable fixes minor connection issues.

If the controller lights up but buttons do not work, the controller itself might be faulty. Or, there could be a break in the wiring harness. The vehicle harness connects the controller to the plow's power unit. This harness has many wires. Each wire carries a signal for a specific plow function. Use a wiring diagram specific to your Fisher plow model. This diagram helps you trace wires. It shows you what wire goes where.

Test for continuity in the harness wires. Use a multimeter. Disconnect the harness from both ends. Touch one probe to one end of a wire. Touch the other probe to the other end. If you hear a beep, the wire is good. If no beep, the wire is broken. This method helps find internal wire breaks.

*   **Controller Power Issues:**
    *   Check the dedicated fuse for the plow harness in your vehicle's fuse box.
    *   Verify the power supply to the controller port.
    *   Ensure the controller cable is securely plugged in at both ends.

*   **Controller Cable and Connector Checks:**
    *   Examine the controller cable for physical damage.
    *   Clean any dirt or corrosion from the cable connectors.
    *   Try unplugging and re-plugging the controller to reset the connection.

*   **Vehicle Harness Diagnostics:**
    *   Refer to your Fisher plow wiring diagram.
    *   Test individual wires in the vehicle harness for continuity.
    *   Look for bent pins or corrosion in the harness connectors at the plow and vehicle side.
    *   If specific functions fail, focus on the wires for those functions.

A faulty controller or a damaged harness can be difficult to fix without replacements. If you have confirmed power to the controller and cable integrity, a replacement controller might be necessary. Always buy genuine Fisher parts for best results.

### Common Fisher Plow Mechanical and Blade Problems

Beyond electrical and hydraulic systems, your Fisher plow has mechanical parts. These parts can also cause problems. The plow blade itself needs attention. Check the cutting edge. This is the steel bar at the bottom of the blade. It wears down over time. A worn cutting edge can make plowing less effective. It can also damage the road surface. Replace a worn cutting edge.

Trip springs are important. They allow the plow blade to trip forward if it hits an obstacle. This prevents damage to the plow and your vehicle. If a trip spring breaks, the plow might not trip correctly. This can cause severe damage. Always check your trip springs. Make sure they are intact. They need to have proper tension. Adjust or replace springs as needed.

Plow shoes or skid shoes protect the cutting edge. They lift the blade slightly off the ground. This helps prevent wear on the cutting edge. Check them for wear. If they are worn flat, replace them. Worn shoes can cause the plow to dig in or scrape too much. This affects plowing quality.

The plow's pivot points need lubrication. These are areas where the blade moves or pivots. Without grease, they can seize up. This makes angling or lifting difficult. Grease all pivot points regularly. Use a good quality grease. Regular greasing keeps your plow moving smoothly.

*   **Cutting Edge Wear:**
    *   Inspect the cutting edge for excessive wear.
    *   Replace the cutting edge when it becomes thin or uneven.
    *   Ensure all cutting edge bolts are tight.

*   **Trip Spring Function:**
    *   Examine all trip springs for breakage or damage.
    *   Check that springs have enough tension.
    *   Adjust spring tension if necessary, following manufacturer guidelines.
    *   Replace broken or weak springs promptly.

*   **Plow Shoe Condition:**
    *   Check the condition of the plow shoes.
    *   Replace shoes if they are heavily worn down.
    *   Adjust shoe height to prevent excessive cutting edge wear.

*   **Lubrication Points:**
    *   Locate all pivot points on your plow.
    *   Grease these points regularly, especially before and after plowing.
    *   Use appropriate grease for cold weather conditions.

These mechanical parts absorb a lot of stress during plowing. Regular checks and maintenance prevent bigger issues. Addressing them promptly extends your Fisher plow's life.

### Optimizing Your Fisher Snow Plow Performance

Preventative maintenance saves you time and money. It also keeps your Fisher snow plow working reliably. Do not wait for a problem to occur. Regular checks help avoid breakdowns. After each plowing season, store your plow correctly. Clean it thoroughly. Remove all dirt and salt. Salt causes corrosion. Corrosion damages electrical parts and metal.

Lubricate all moving parts before storage. Grease the pivot pins. Coat hydraulic cylinder rods with grease. This prevents rust. Rust makes parts stick. It can also damage seals. Check all hydraulic fluid lines for leaks. Fix any leaks before storing the plow. Low fluid levels can harm the pump.

Inspect all electrical connections. Look for corrosion. Clean them. Apply dielectric grease to prevent future corrosion. Check wiring for fraying or cuts. Repair or replace damaged wires. This ensures good electrical flow next season.

Before the next winter, do a full test run. Connect the plow to your vehicle. Check all functions. Lift, lower, angle left, angle right. Make sure everything moves smoothly. Check all lights. Ensure they work. This pre-season check helps you find small issues. You can fix them before heavy snow falls.

*   **Post-Season Storage:**
    *   Clean your plow completely, removing all dirt, ice, and salt.
    *   Lubricate all pivot points and cylinder rods.
    *   Check for and repair any hydraulic fluid leaks.
    *   Inspect and clean all electrical connections.
    *   Store the plow in a dry place.

*   **Pre-Season Preparation:**
    *   Reconnect the plow to your vehicle.
    *   Top off hydraulic fluid if needed.
    *   Cycle the plow through all functions to bleed air and confirm operation.
    *   Test all lights and safety features.
    *   Check all bolts and pins for tightness.

Regular maintenance and timely inspections extend your Fisher plow's life. It ensures your plow is ready when winter arrives. A well-maintained plow performs better and lasts longer.
