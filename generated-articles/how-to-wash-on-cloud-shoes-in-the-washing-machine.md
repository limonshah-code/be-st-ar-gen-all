## Machine Washing On Cloud Shoes: Your Ultimate Guide

Are your beloved On Cloud shoes looking a little… cloudier than you’d like? I know the feeling. We wear these shoes for comfort, performance, and style, but they pick up dirt and grime along the way. Many people wonder if it's safe to wash On Cloud shoes in the washing machine. The good news is, you can!

This guide will show you exactly how to wash On Cloud shoes in the washing machine without causing damage. We will cover everything from essential supplies to pre-washing steps, the correct machine settings, and safe drying methods. Get ready to refresh your favorite footwear and bring back that clean, crisp look. I will share my best tips to keep your On Clouds looking great for longer.

### Takeaway:

*   **Prep is key:** Remove laces and insoles; brush off loose dirt.
*   **Use protection:** Place shoes in a mesh laundry bag.
*   **Gentle cycle:** Always use cold water and a delicate setting.
*   **Mild detergent:** Opt for a liquid, non-bleach formula.
*   **Air dry:** Never use a dryer; always air dry your shoes.

You can safely wash On Cloud shoes in the washing machine. Use a mesh laundry bag, a gentle cycle with cold water, and a mild liquid detergent. Always remove laces and insoles before washing. Air dry the shoes completely afterward to prevent damage.

## Is It Safe to Machine Wash On Cloud Shoes?

This is the first question on everyone's mind. Can you really put your expensive On Cloud shoes into the washing machine? The answer is generally yes, but with important caveats. On Cloud shoes are known for their unique CloudTec soles and breathable uppers. These materials are durable, but they require a gentle approach when cleaning.

Machine washing can be harsh if not done correctly. High heat, strong detergents, and aggressive spin cycles can damage the shoe's structure, adhesives, and fabric. Understanding the right method protects your investment. I have personally found success washing my On Clouds this way. It saves time and gets them cleaner than hand-washing alone.

Some shoe manufacturers advise against machine washing. They prefer hand-washing for best results. However, many On Cloud users report successful machine cleaning when following specific guidelines. My experience shows that a cold, gentle wash is effective and safe. We need to focus on protecting the shoe during the wash cycle.

The shoe materials, like the mesh upper and rubber sole, hold up well to water. It is the heat and harsh chemicals that pose a risk. We will explore how to minimize these risks in the following sections. This method helps maintain the integrity of your On Cloud footwear.

## Gathering Your Essential On Cloud Washing Supplies

Before you start tossing your On Cloud shoes into the washing machine, gather a few essential items. Having everything ready makes the process smooth and effective. You do not want to stop mid-way because you forgot something crucial. I always make sure I have these items on hand.

First, you will need a **mild liquid laundry detergent**. Avoid powdered detergents, as they can sometimes leave residue. Do not use bleach or harsh chemicals. These can damage the fabric and cause discoloration, especially on colored or white On Cloud shoes. A gentle, eco-friendly detergent is often a good choice.

Second, a **mesh laundry bag** is non-negotiable. This bag protects your shoes during the wash cycle. It prevents them from banging around inside the drum. This prevents damage to both the shoes and your washing machine. The bag also keeps laces and insoles contained if you choose to wash them with the shoes.

Next, have a **soft-bristled brush or an old toothbrush** handy. You will use this for pre-cleaning. A **small bowl or bucket** for mixing a pre-treatment solution can also be useful. Finally, grab some **old towels** or paper towels for drying purposes. These items are simple but make a big difference in the outcome.

Having these supplies ready ensures a safe and effective wash. It prevents potential damage to your shoes. It also helps them come out looking fresh and clean. Now, let us get to the preparation steps.

## Prepping Your On Cloud Shoes for the Wash

Proper preparation is crucial before you wash On Cloud shoes in the washing machine. This step removes loose dirt and protects delicate parts. Skipping this can lead to a less effective clean or even damage. I always spend a few minutes on this.

### Removing Laces and Insoles

First, **remove the laces and insoles** from your On Cloud shoes. Laces can get tangled in the washing machine, potentially causing damage. Insoles often hold more odor and dirt than the rest of the shoe. They also dry at a different rate.

You can hand wash laces separately in a small bowl with warm soapy water. Rub them together to remove dirt. Rinse them thoroughly and let them air dry. For insoles, gently scrub them with a brush and mild soap. Rinse well and let them air dry completely before putting them back in the shoes. Removing these parts helps get a more thorough clean for the entire shoe.

### Initial Dirt Removal

Next, it is time for **initial dirt removal**. Take your shoes outside or over a trash can. Clap the soles together to knock off any large clumps of mud or dirt. Use a soft-bristled brush or an old toothbrush to scrub away surface grime. Pay attention to the soles and the unique CloudTec pods, where dirt often gets trapped.

You can use a dry brush for this step. For tougher, caked-on mud, lightly dampen the brush. Avoid saturating the shoe at this point. The goal is to remove as much loose debris as possible. This prevents it from circulating in the washing machine. It also helps your washing machine stay cleaner. If you want to dive deeper into general cleaning, you can explore guides on [how to clean my On Cloud shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-my-on-cloud-shoes) for additional tips on stain removal.

After brushing, gently wipe the exterior of the shoes with a damp cloth. This removes any remaining surface dust or light stains. Your shoes are now ready for their machine wash journey. These simple steps ensure a better cleaning experience.

## The Gentle Cycle: How to Machine Wash Your On Cloud Shoes

Now we come to the main event: washing your On Cloud shoes in the washing machine. This step requires precision. Choosing the right settings and detergent is vital to protect your shoes. I follow these steps every time I machine wash my shoes.

### Choosing the Right Settings

First, place your prepped On Cloud shoes into a **mesh laundry bag**. I usually put one shoe per bag if I am washing two, or two shoes in a larger bag if they fit loosely. This prevents them from banging against the drum. It also protects them from getting snagged. If you are worried about noise or machine balance, you can add a few old towels to the wash. These towels cushion the shoes during the cycle.

Select the **delicate or gentle cycle** on your washing machine. This cycle uses slower agitation and less intense spinning. It mimics hand washing, which is ideal for shoes. Set the water temperature to **cold**. Hot water can damage adhesives and shrink or warp the shoe materials. Cold water cleans effectively without causing harm. Avoid any settings that include a heated dry cycle. We will address drying later. For a deeper understanding of general machine maintenance, you might want to look at [how to clean washing machine](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine) to ensure your appliance is in top shape.

### Detergent Selection

Use only a **mild liquid laundry detergent**. Add a small amount, typically half the recommended dose for a regular load. Too much detergent can leave residue on your shoes. It can also be difficult to rinse out. Avoid fabric softeners. Fabric softeners can leave a film on the shoe materials. This film can attract more dirt over time.

Do not use bleach or harsh stain removers directly on your On Cloud shoes. If you have tough stains, pre-treat them by hand using a spot cleaner designed for athletic shoes. Always test any cleaner on an inconspicuous area first. This prevents potential discoloration or damage. Once the detergent is added and settings are chosen, start the wash cycle. Your On Clouds are now on their way to becoming fresh again. Remember, gentle is key when you wash On Cloud shoes in the washing machine.

## Drying Your On Cloud Shoes Safely and Effectively

After the wash cycle finishes, the drying process is critical. This step determines if your On Cloud shoes retain their shape and integrity. Improper drying can lead to shrinkage, warping, or even damage to the shoe's cushioning. I cannot stress this enough: **never put your On Cloud shoes in the dryer.**

High heat from a machine dryer can melt adhesives, distort the unique CloudTec sole, and shrink the upper materials. It can also cause the fabric to become brittle. This significantly shortens the lifespan of your shoes. Air drying is the only safe method for your On Clouds.

To air dry your shoes, first, remove them from the mesh laundry bag. You can gently press any excess water out with a clean towel. Avoid twisting or wringing them. Next, find a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or heat sources. A cool, dry place indoors is ideal. You can place them outdoors in the shade if the weather permits.

To help them dry faster and maintain their shape, stuff the inside of each shoe with **clean paper towels or newspaper**. Change the paper every few hours. The paper absorbs moisture from inside the shoe. This speeds up drying time and helps prevent odors. Do not use colored newspaper as the ink can transfer to the shoe's lining.

Place the shoes upright or on their side. Ensure air circulates around them. You can also place them near a fan. This further enhances air circulation. Drying time can vary. It depends on humidity levels and the initial wetness of the shoes. It usually takes 24 to 48 hours for them to dry completely. Make sure they are bone-dry before you wear them again. Wearing damp shoes can lead to mold and odor. Proper drying ensures your On Clouds stay comfortable and last longer.

## Post-Wash Care and Maintenance Tips

Washing your On Cloud shoes is a great start. However, ongoing post-wash care and maintenance help them stay clean and perform well for longer. Think of it as protecting your investment. I have a few simple habits that keep my shoes looking great.

First, consider using a **shoe deodorizer spray** or cedar shoe trees. After your shoes are completely dry, a quick spray inside can prevent odors from building up. Cedar shoe trees absorb moisture and keep the shoe's shape. This is especially helpful if you wear your On Clouds frequently.

Regular **spot cleaning** is another key tip. You do not need to machine wash your shoes every time they get a little dirty. For small scuffs or light mud splashes, use a damp cloth and a small amount of mild soap. Gently wipe the affected area. This extends the time between full washes. This method also reduces wear and tear on the shoes from frequent machine cycles. For more detailed spot cleaning specific to certain types of On Clouds, check out resources like [how to clean On Cloud tennis shoes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-on-cloud-tennis-shoes), which offers targeted advice.

Protecting your shoes with a **water and stain repellent spray** can also make a big difference. Apply this spray to clean, dry shoes according to the product instructions. This creates a barrier against water and stains. It makes future cleaning much easier. Reapply periodically, especially after washing.

Store your On Cloud shoes properly when not in use. Keep them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Avoid leaving them in humid environments like gym bags. This prevents mildew and unpleasant odors. If you store them for extended periods, consider stuffing them with acid-free paper to maintain shape. By following these simple maintenance tips, your On Cloud shoes will not only look cleaner but also last longer. This maximizes the value you get from your favorite footwear.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Washing On Cloud Shoes

Even with the best intentions, it is easy to make mistakes when cleaning shoes. Knowing what *not* to do is as important as knowing what *to* do. Avoiding these common pitfalls ensures your On Cloud shoes remain in top condition. I have learned these lessons the hard way sometimes.

One of the biggest mistakes is **using the wrong water temperature**. Always use cold water. Hot water can damage the adhesives that hold your shoes together. It can also cause the materials to shrink or warp. This is especially true for synthetic fabrics and rubber components. Stick to cold water for every wash.

Another frequent error is **using harsh detergents or bleach**. Bleach can strip colors from the fabric. It can also weaken the material over time. Strong detergents can leave residues or damage the delicate mesh of your On Clouds. Opt for a mild, liquid detergent specifically designed for delicates. Avoid powdered detergents, as they often do not dissolve fully. This can leave gritty residue.

**Skipping the mesh laundry bag** is a common oversight. Without a bag, your shoes will tumble freely in the washing machine. This can lead to them getting scuffed, snagged, or even damaging the machine drum. The bag provides a protective barrier. It also helps contain any loose parts like laces if you wash them together.

Finally, **using a machine dryer** is the most detrimental mistake. The high heat from a dryer will almost certainly damage your On Cloud shoes. It can melt the glue, deform the CloudTec pods, and cause permanent shrinkage. Always, always air dry your shoes. Patience is key here. Let them dry naturally in a well-ventilated area.

By avoiding these common mistakes, you ensure your On Cloud shoes get a thorough, safe clean. You extend their lifespan and keep them looking great. Proper care helps you enjoy their comfort and performance for a long time.
