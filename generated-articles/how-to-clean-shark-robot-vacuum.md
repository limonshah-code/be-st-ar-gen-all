5.  **Clean or replace the filter:** Tap the filter over a trash can to remove dust. If it is washable, rinse it with water and let it dry completely. If not, replace it according to your manual's schedule. This filter helps keep the air clean. It also protects the base's motor.
6.  **Clean the internal pathway:** Some self-empty bases have a pathway from the intake to the bag. Use a cleaning tool or a vacuum hose to clear any blockages. This helps dirt flow smoothly into the bag.

Regular cleaning of the self-empty base is crucial. It ensures your robot can empty itself. This keeps your home cleaner. It also extends the life of your entire Shark robot vacuum system.

## Troubleshooting Common Cleaning-Related Issues

Even after cleaning, your Shark robot vacuum might show issues. Many problems come from incomplete cleaning. Knowing how to fix these can save you time. It keeps your robot running.

### Poor Suction After Cleaning

You just cleaned your robot, but it still leaves dirt. This is frustrating. Here are common reasons for poor suction:

*   **Wet Filter:** Did you wash the filter? Was it fully dry before you put it back? A wet filter blocks airflow. It can also damage the motor. Always wait at least 24 hours for a washed filter to dry.
*   **Clogged Air Path:** Check the dust bin entry point. Is there anything stuck in the opening that leads to the brush roll? Sometimes large debris gets lodged there. Clear any blockages.
*   **Full Dust Bin/Bag:** Double-check if the dust bin is empty. If you have a self-empty base, ensure the bag is not full. A full bag prevents the robot from emptying its internal bin.
*   **Worn Brush Roll/Filter:** Cleaning helps, but parts wear out. If your brush roll bristles are very flat, or the filter is old, they might need replacement. Worn parts cannot do their job well.

### Error Messages (Sensor Blockages)

Your robot stops and shows an error light. It says a sensor is blocked. This is a common issue.

*   **Dirty Cliff Sensors:** The most common cause. These small windows on the bottom detect stairs. If they are dusty, the robot thinks it is at a ledge. It stops moving. Wipe them thoroughly with a dry cloth.
*   **Bumper Sensor Issues:** The front bumper detects obstacles. If dust or debris gets behind it, it might get stuck. Gently push the bumper in and out. Clean the area where it meets the robot's body. Make sure it moves freely.
*   **Wheel Sensors:** Some robots have sensors near the wheels. These detect if a wheel is stuck. Clean around the wheels. Remove any hair or threads. Ensure the wheels spin easily.

### Robot Getting Stuck Often

A clean robot should move freely. If it gets stuck more than usual, cleaning might be the key.

*   **Dirty Wheels/Axles:** Hair wrapped around wheel axles prevents free movement. Clean the main drive wheels. Clean the front swivel wheel. Ensure no debris limits their spin.
*   **Side Brush Obstructions:** If side brushes are clogged, they can push against things. This can cause the robot to get stuck. Remove hair from side brushes. Make sure they spin properly.
*   **Unseen Obstacles:** Sometimes, small items on the floor cause problems. Cables, small toys, or thick rugs can trap the robot. Clear your floor area before starting a cleaning cycle.

Regular checks after cleaning can spot these issues early. Your robot will run smoother. It will complete its cleaning jobs without problems.
