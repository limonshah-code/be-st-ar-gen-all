## Frequently Asked Questions About Cleaning Greasy Keyboards

### Q1: What is the best cleaner for a greasy keyboard?
**A1:** Isopropyl alcohol (70% or higher) is the best choice. It is effective at dissolving grease and oil. It also evaporates quickly, reducing the risk of moisture damage to electronics. Always apply it to a cloth or swab first, not directly to the keyboard. This helps control moisture.

### Q2: Can I use water to clean my keyboard?
**A2:** Avoid using plain water to clean your keyboard, especially directly. Water can cause short circuits and damage electronic components. Small amounts of water mixed with soap can be used for soaking removable keycaps. Ensure these keycaps are completely dry before putting them back on the keyboard.

### Q3: How often should I clean my greasy keyboard?
**A3:** For light grease, a weekly surface wipe with isopropyl alcohol is good. If you eat near your keyboard or use it heavily, a light surface clean every few days might be needed. A deep clean, where you remove keycaps, is recommended every few months or when significant grime builds up.

### Q4: Will cleaning my keyboard damage it?
**A4:** Cleaning your keyboard correctly will not damage it. Using too much liquid, harsh chemicals like bleach, or abrasive materials can cause damage. Always unplug the keyboard first. Use the recommended tools and cleaners. Be gentle when removing and replacing keycaps to prevent damage to the switches.

### Q5: Can I put my keycaps in the dishwasher?
**A5:** No, do not put keycaps in a dishwasher. The high heat can warp the plastic. Harsh detergents can damage the keycap surface or legends. Soaking them in warm, soapy water and then air-drying them is the safest and most effective method for cleaning individual keycaps.

### Q6: How do I remove sticky residue that won't come off?
**A6:** For stubborn sticky residue, use undiluted isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher). Apply it to a cotton swab or microfiber cloth. Rub the area gently but firmly. For very persistent spots, a plastic toothpick or a soft brush can help gently dislodge the residue after the alcohol has softened it.
