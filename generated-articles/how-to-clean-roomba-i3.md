If you want to keep your floors truly clean, knowing **how to clean Roomba i3** is essential. Neglecting maintenance can lead to reduced suction, tangled brushes, and inefficient cleaning.

A clean Roomba i3 works efficiently, picks up more dirt, and lasts longer. It prevents common issues like poor navigation or getting stuck. This comprehensive guide will walk you through every step. We will cover cleaning the dust bin, brushes, filter, wheels, and sensors. You will learn easy tips to keep your Roomba i3 in top shape. Let us dive in and give your robot vacuum the care it deserves.

#### Takeaway:
*   Regularly empty the dust bin and clean the filter to maintain suction.

*   Consistent cleaning extends your Roomba i3's lifespan and performance.

To clean your Roomba i3, regularly empty its dust bin and tap the filter. Remove hair from brushes and the side brush. Wipe the sensors and charging contacts with a dry cloth. Clean the front caster wheel and main drive wheels of any debris. This routine care ensures your robot vacuum operates efficiently and lasts longer.

### Understanding Your Roomba i3's Cleaning Needs

Your Roomba i3 is a hardworking robot. It navigates your home, picking up dirt, dust, and pet hair. This constant work means it collects a lot of debris inside its parts. Over time, this buildup affects its ability to clean effectively. It can also lead to mechanical issues. Understanding *why* regular cleaning matters helps you commit to the routine.

A Roomba i3 with clogged components struggles to maintain suction. Its brushes might not spin correctly. Its sensors might get dirty, causing navigation problems. Ignoring these signs can shorten your Roomba's lifespan. It is not just about keeping the floors clean. It is about protecting your investment. I make sure to check my Roomba i3 often, especially after cleaning pet hair.

Different parts of your Roomba i3 require different cleaning frequencies. The dust bin and filter need attention most often. Brushes can accumulate hair quickly. Sensors and wheels need periodic checks. We will break down each component. This helps you create a simple cleaning schedule. Proper maintenance ensures your Roomba i3 continues to deliver spotless floors.

### Emptying the Dust Bin and Cleaning the Filter

The dust bin is where your Roomba i3 collects all the debris from your floors. It fills up quickly, especially in homes with pets or high traffic. A full dust bin cannot hold more dirt. This means your Roomba leaves dirt behind. Emptying it after every few cleaning cycles is a good practice. I usually do it after every run, especially during shedding season.

To empty the dust bin, simply press the release button. Pull the bin out from the back of the robot. Open the bin door and dump the contents into a trash can. You might see a lot of compacted dust or hair. Give the bin a good shake to get everything out.

The filter works inside the dust bin. It captures fine particles and allergens. A dirty filter restricts airflow, reducing suction power. You should tap the filter against a trash can to shake out trapped dust. Do this weekly or bi-weekly. iRobot recommends replacing the filter every two to three months. This keeps your Roomba i3's air filtration system efficient. For a detailed guide, see: [how to clean Roomba dust bin](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-roomba-dust-bin) and [how to clean Roomba filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-roomba-filter).

*   **Steps to Clean the Dust Bin and Filter:**
    1.  Press the bin release button on the back of your Roomba i3.
    2.  Pull the dust bin straight out.
    3.  Open the dust bin door and empty all contents into a trash can.
    4.  Locate the filter in the dust bin. Pull it out by its tab.
    5.  Tap the filter firmly against a trash can to remove dust. Do not wash the filter with water.
    6.  Wipe the inside of the dust bin with a dry cloth.
    7.  Reinsert the clean filter into the dust bin.
    8.  Slide the dust bin back into your Roomba i3 until it clicks.

### Maintaining Your Roomba i3's Brushes

Your Roomba i3 has two main components that gather debris: the multi-surface rubber brushes and the side brush. These brushes are critical for picking up dirt. The rubber brushes agitate dirt from carpets and hard floors. The side brush sweeps debris from edges and corners into the cleaning path. Both can get tangled with hair and strings. This reduces their effectiveness. I check these brushes after every few runs, especially if my dog is shedding.

**Cleaning the Multi-Surface Rubber Brushes:**
Hair, especially long human or pet hair, wraps tightly around these brushes. This prevents them from rotating properly. If they cannot spin, your Roomba i3 cannot clean well.

*   **Steps to Clean Rubber Brushes:**
    1.  Turn your Roomba i3 over.
    2.  Locate the yellow brush frame release tabs. Press them to lift the frame.
    3.  Remove both rubber brushes.
    4.  Pull off any hair or debris wrapped around the square and hexagonal ends of the brushes.
    5.  Remove the yellow brush caps. Clean any hair stuck underneath.
    6.  Reinstall the yellow brush caps. Ensure they click back into place.
    7.  Place the clean brushes back into the Roomba. Match the shapes of the ends to the slots.
    8.  Close the brush frame until it clicks.

**Cleaning the Side Brush:**
The small, three-armed side brush is also prone to tangles. If it is tangled, it cannot sweep dirt effectively.

*   **Steps to Clean the Side Brush:**
    1.  Using a small Phillips head screwdriver, unscrew the side brush.
    2.  Carefully lift the side brush off.
    3.  Remove any hair or debris wrapped around the brush and its post.
    4.  Wipe the area under the side brush.
    5.  Reattach the side brush and secure it with the screw.

Regular cleaning of these brushes is vital. It maintains your Roomba i3's powerful cleaning performance. For a complete guide on brush maintenance, visit: [how to clean Roomba brushes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-roomba-brushes).

### Cleaning Your Roomba i3's Wheels

Your Roomba i3 relies on its wheels to move smoothly across your floors. It has two main drive wheels and one front caster wheel. Debris like hair, dust, or carpet fibers can get trapped in these wheels. This makes it difficult for your Roomba to navigate properly. It might move erratically or get stuck more often. Maintaining clean wheels ensures consistent movement and efficient cleaning paths. I always check these after cleaning particularly dusty areas.

**Cleaning the Front Caster Wheel:**
The front caster wheel swivels, allowing your Roomba to change direction. It can easily collect hair and lint. If this wheel gets jammed, your Roomba i3 might struggle to steer.

*   **Steps to Clean the Front Caster Wheel:**
    1.  Turn your Roomba i3 upside down.
    2.  Firmly pull the front caster wheel assembly out. It might require a little force.
    3.  Remove any hair or debris from the wheel and its axle.
    4.  You can also remove the wheel from its housing for a deeper clean.
    5.  Spin the wheel by hand to check for smooth movement.
    6.  Reinsert the wheel assembly into your Roomba i3 until it clicks.

**Cleaning the Drive Wheels:**
The two large drive wheels propel your Roomba forward. Hair and debris can build up around the axles of these wheels. This can hinder their rotation.

*   **Steps to Clean the Drive Wheels:**
    1.  Inspect the area around the drive wheels.
    2.  Use tweezers or a small tool to
