The glass globes are critical. They are where you see the action. Keeping them pristine improves the visual appeal. It also ensures a clean experience. Deep cleaning these requires specific steps.

Resin and residue stick to glass. A strong solvent and abrasive are needed. Isopropyl alcohol works wonders. Coarse salt adds the scrubbing power. This combination breaks down even stubborn grime. My experience shows this method is highly effective.

1.  **Add Isopropyl Alcohol:** Pour a generous amount of 90% or higher isopropyl alcohol into each glass globe. Make sure it coats all inside surfaces.
2.  **Add Coarse Salt:** Follow with a few tablespoons of coarse salt. The salt acts as an abrasive. It scrapes off stuck-on residue.
3.  **Plug and Shake:** Cap the openings of the globes. Use your hands or stoppers. Shake the globes vigorously. The salt and alcohol will slosh around. They will scrub the inside surfaces.
4.  **Target Stubborn Spots:** For very dirty areas, let the solution sit. Allow it to soak for 15-30 minutes. Then, shake again. You might use a bottle brush if needed. For heavily caked-on areas, sometimes a similar approach is used when you [clean the bottom of a pan](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bottom-of-pan).
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Pour out the dirty solution. Rinse the globes under warm running water. Ensure all alcohol and salt are gone. Rinse until no suds or residue remain.
6.  **Inspect for Cleanliness:** Hold the globes up to light. Check for any remaining spots. Repeat the process if necessary.

Properly cleaned globes enhance the beauty of your Stundenglass. They also provide a clearer view of the spinning action. This step is central to a satisfying clean.

### Cleaning the Percolator, Downstem, and Intake

These are the unseen workhorses. They filter and cool your intake. Because of this, they accumulate significant buildup. They need careful attention. Their intricate design means a simple rinse is not enough.

Residue often clogs these parts. This affects performance. It restricts airflow. A thorough cleaning ensures proper function. It also maintains optimal draw. I find that these parts often require more focused effort.

*   **Soak in Alcohol:** Place the percolator, downstem, and intake into a container. Pour isopropyl alcohol over them. Make sure they are fully submerged. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes. For heavy buildup, soak overnight.
*   **Brush Intricate Areas:** Use pipe cleaners or small brushes. Gently scrub inside the tubes and holes. Reach every crevice. Pay close attention to the small slits in the percolator. These are prone to clogging.
*   **Shake with Salt (Optional):** For stubborn areas on the downstem, you can put it in a small bag with alcohol and salt. Shake it vigorously like you did the globes. This helps dislodge tough grime.
*   **Rinse with Warm Water:** After scrubbing, rinse all components under warm running water. Flush out all loosened debris and cleaning solution. Ensure water flows freely through all passages.
