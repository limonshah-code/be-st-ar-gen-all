Dyson's filters are usually designed to last the lifetime of the machine. You just need to wash them regularly. For instance, knowing [how to clean Dyson vacuum filter](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dyson-vacuum-filter) properly ensures the vacuum maintains its filtration efficiency. Proper filter maintenance is key for Dyson vacuums to perform at their best.

### Bagged vs. Bagless Systems

Miele vacuums use a bagged system. This means dirt and debris collect inside a disposable filter bag. These bags are multi-layered. They act as an additional filter. When you change the bag, you simply seal it and throw it away. This process keeps you from coming into direct contact with dust. It is very hygienic, especially for people with allergies.

Dyson vacuums are bagless. They collect dirt in a clear dustbin. You empty this bin directly into the trash. This design saves you the cost of buying bags. It also allows you to see how much dirt you have collected. However, emptying the bin can release some dust into the air. This might be a concern for severe allergy sufferers. Cleaning your Dyson vacuum head regularly also helps to maintain optimal performance and prevent clogs, ensuring proper airflow in the bagless system. You can find out [how to clean Dyson vacuum head](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dyson-vacuum-head) to keep it working efficiently.
